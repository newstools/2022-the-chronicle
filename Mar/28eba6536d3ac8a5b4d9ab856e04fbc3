The 25-year-old Nyathi of Body Works Gym, came first in a field of six. Nyasha Chakanetsa of Harare’s Newlands Club took second spot while third place went to Nomathamsanqa Phiri of Lodonz Fitness of Harare. In the senior men’s bodybuilding, Body Works Gym fielded two athletes, Kudakwashe Nhema and Shawn Ngwenya, who both finished in the top four. Nhema took bronze while Ngwenya was fourth in a contest that was won by Tsungi Chakauya of Pro-Fitness Health Club in Harare. Ngwenya also entered the men’s physique open where he finished in 10th place.  Nathan Greenland, Body Works Gym director, who accompanied the athletes to Harare, was proud of the first timers’ display in the competition. By winning Ms Novice, Nyathi has followed in the footsteps of other Bulawayo bodybuilders that have brought the title to the City of Kings and Queens. Shantel Bhatch, Selina Manuel and Kylie MacDonald have won the title before. At the time they were crowned champions, the three were also training at Body Works Gym, which has made the fitness facility that opened its doors to the public in 2014, home of champions. — Follow on Twitter @Mdawini_29
