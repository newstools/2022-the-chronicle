Amaqaqa’s leader, Khulekani Khabo said the live launch will fulfil their fans wish to see the group live in action. “Once launched, the album will be released on various digital platforms at the end of April. The launch will coincide with the celebration of our first award. “Also, it’ll serve as a response to fans who have been craving to see us performing live,” said Khabo. He said Ezosinga is largely an African affair that seeks to celebrate the culture of black people. “The album speaks about the African essence, African character and identity. We’re trying to educate people about our roots by enlightening those who don’t know about what happened in the past.” The 10-track album has songs Madlokovu, Enkanini, Mathonga, Mbambangwe, Amalobolo, Juba Lakhwelimota, Inkonkoni, Izikhonkwane, Impi and Thekwane. Khabo called on people to attend the album launches in their numbers so that they experience the little change that they are trying to make with their music. “We’re promising an amazing performance to everyone who’ll attend. We’re thankful to those who’ve supported us thus far because without them, we wouldn’t have gotten this far,” said Khabo. – @mthabisi_mthire
