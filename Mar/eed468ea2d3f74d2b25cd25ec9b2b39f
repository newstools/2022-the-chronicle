The Chronicle Travelling light
Hebrews 12:1
“Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.”  Life is a journey and like any other, it is easier and more enjoyable when you are travelling light. Carrying around emotional and spiritual baggage can feel heavier than a bag of cement. So many of us cannot enjoy our journey because we are weighed down by things we won’t let go of. There are so many things that we are carrying that we should release; people, pain, fear, doubt, worry, anxiety, guilt, sin, the list is endless. God is calling on you today to unload any unnecessary baggage you were never meant to bear on Him and lead a life of liberty and being the best you can be. If you let Him, He can ease you of all  your burdens and grant you a new life. He has a great race for you to run, He wants to use you in a big way but in order to accomplish your assignment, you have to drop some stuff. Sometimes your greatest addition will come from your biggest subtraction. You need to free your hands and your heart to receive new blessings, you won’t have the space for more when you are holding on to what you should let go of. Take a look around, do an assessment of your life and let go of the dead weight, surrender it to God and ask Him to grant you strength and direction. May He help us to get rid of any baggage that is hindering us on this journey of life.
Be blessed
