ZIFA Bulawayo Province has deferred the start of its league programmes by two weeks in a bid to wrap up all logistics to ensure a safe return to activities. The province’s leagues had been scheduled to start last Saturday, but Zifa Bulawayo said it was still tying up some loose ends. Zifa Bulawayo Province oversees the running of Division Two football all junior leagues. Chairman Francis Ntutha said: “We are still a bit behind in terms of vaccinated players, but the numbers are encouraging. We are also sorting out the issue of venues and how we are going to run our programmes.  Remember we also had our AGM earlier in the year and we have some reports that need to sail through with the clubs before we can start.” Last month, Zifa Bulawayo Province announced that it had sealed a three-year sponsorship deal with Machache Security Services, which pledged full support for juniors’ football in the city. For the first year, the company has availed US$4 000 for junior leagues. There has not been any action in junior football in over two years since the outbreak of Covid-19 and the gesture by Machache is likely to boost the roadmap for the restart of junior football. There are more than 2 520 juniors between the ages of 12-18 that play football from March to December under the Zifa Bulawayo Province leagues. – @innocentskizoe
