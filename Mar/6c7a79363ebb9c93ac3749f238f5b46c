The Chronicle Harare Bureau Government has approved the setting up of a commercial consulate in Dubai to be manned by economic and trade attachés to complement investment promotion efforts by Zimbabwe’s embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Trade between Zimbabwe and other participants at the ongoing Expo 2020 Dubai has peaked to approximately US$1,6 billion as the country’s attendance of the global business event starts bearing fruit.  Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Ambassador Frederick Shava revealed this after yesterday’s Cabinet meeting. President Mnangagwa attended Zimbabwe’s National Day at the Expo as part of his administration’s foreign policy to advance trade relations on top of diplomatic niceties as a means of improving the country’s economic growth trajectory. Minister Shava explained that at this point, it was difficult to compute the exact quantum of business created by the country’s participation since business synergies had been created, but noted that they had been boosted by the setting up of a commercial and consulate office.
