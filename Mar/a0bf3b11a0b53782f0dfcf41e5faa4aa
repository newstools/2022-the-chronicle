The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter IN recent times, South African Afro-pop duo Blaq Diamond have made Zimbabwe their second home after frequent performances in Harare, Bulawayo, Gwanda and Beitbridge.

The Boundary manager Emmanuel Takaedza “Manu” Mahaso said all logistics are in place to host the Summer YoMuthi hitmakers.  “Everything is in place for the show. Covid-19 is still a reality so we will stick to restrictions to make sure that everyone is safe from the pandemic. We urge people to come in their numbers and be at the venue early because gates will be open in the afternoon and we will be starting early to avoid ending the show in the wee hours of the night,” said Manu. The last time Blaq Diamond performed in Bulawayo was in November at Umguza Yacht Club. – @eMKlass_49
