THE Highlanders secretariat has not been paying referees for Bosso 90 home games in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League. Bosso 90 have just one win under their belt and there is growing belief that match officials have not been kind to the side due to non-payment. “The team has gone for five games without paying referees, it’s an embarrassing situation, especially considering that even the affiliation fees were not paid in full,” said a source close to the side However, Zifa Southern Region board member in charge of finance, Tizirayi Luphahla told Chronicle Sport that they were yet to receive a report from the referees’ committee about the non-payment of fees by Highlanders.  “We wouldn’t confirm nor deny anything about the non-payment, but officially we haven’t received any complaint or issue about that,” said Luphahla. Highlanders’ juniors and the developmental side have widely been treated unfairly by members of the secretariat and on more than one occasion one of the staffers told the coaches that they were only draining resources from the club yet bringing nothing in return. “It’s like Highlanders is about the first team only, juniors and the developmental side are treated differently, it’s as if they are not part of the system. Those office guys just don’t have any respect for them. Every other time, the managers have to literally beg for assistance, it’s sad really,” said a course close to the system. Meanwhile, Bosso 90 lost 1-2 to championship chasing Arenel, while log leaders and firm promotional favourites Hwange walloped Mainline 3-0. Experienced campaigners ZPC Hwange routed Mosi Rovers 4-0 to keep in sight of the log leaders.
