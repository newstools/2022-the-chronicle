The Chronicle Prosper Ndlovu in Dubai, UAE
BULAWAYO-based female dance ensemble, Intombi Zomqangala, left the Expo 2020 Dubai visitors asking for more when they delivered a sterling performance at the Sun Stage here last night.  Led by prominent musician, Sandra Ndebele, the group is part of the country’s creative sector representatives and is here to render performances as part of the country’s build-up to the National Day events next Monday, which will be attended by President Mnangagwa. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594316" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-14-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-14-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-14-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In yesterday’s presentation the group delivered a blend of Ndebele and Shona songs, which spoke about Zimbabwe’s beauty and social commentary. Among the songs was: Sala ulandela mama, Ubaba wazala izanka, Aiwa Zimbabwe Inoyera (Zimbabwe is sacred), and Oye njelimana. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594318" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-14-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-14-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-14-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Drum beat, coupled with drama, captivating dance and ululation excited the crowd, which bustled to take photos while others joined in dance. The group will be performing again today at the Earth stage.
