The Chronicle Isaiah 30 vs 21 NIV
Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” Somebody once said: “If you wait too long to decide what you want to do with your life, you’ll discover that you’ve done it already.” Some people think that they will get this grand moment of revelation where their true calling will be unveiled.  They go through life wondering and waiting for that “aha” moment that will tell them exactly what God’s will for them is so they can follow it. While there are times when God gives us a clear calling and tells us the direction we need to take, most of what we do is actually up to us. Your purpose in life is not going to be written on the wall. Instead of waiting for a flashing red light from God, pursue your passion and purpose. You have to take the initial step and God will order your footsteps. If you truly follow and listen to Him and you start going down the wrong path, He will correct you and bring you back on track, but you have to take a step in a certain direction. The one who created us also put in us the dreams, goals and aspirations we have, and He desires that we pursue them. Keep the right perspective, remember it’s what you do today that will determine the future you will have. You have Christ in you, take a step forward and trust Him to guide you. Be blessed
