SJAVA and Amapiano artistes Sir Trill and Felo Le Tee are scheduled to perform at the Summer Block Party  in Bulawayo on March 20.  Fast-growing events promotion company, Fife Street Events who hosted Scorpion Kings in the city recently, are the ones organising this show. Event organiser, Junior Mbanje said everything is on course. “Preparations for the upcoming Summer Block Party are going on well. A surprise addition to the line-up is Sjava. This was after we did a social media survey and Sjava’s name topped the list,” Mbanje said. The Scorpion Kings show almost failed to take off after police disrupted proceedings due to Covid-19 regulations. Event organisers said they will start the show early to avoid violating curfew regulations. <img class="size-full wp-image-594249" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-8-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-8-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-8-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sir Trill “We’re putting our house in order to avoid previous mistakes. We heard the call from patrons to start our shows early and yes, we’ll definitely do so this time around. The show will start in the afternoon, with a variety of local artistes taking turns to warm the stage and keep the fans entertained, then, later on, we’ll have the international acts shut it down. “All this will happen before curfew time to avoid any disappointments and a brush with the law.” It will not be the first time that Sjava will be performing in Bulawayo as he once graced BAC Leisure in 2019. But Felo Le Tee and Sir Trill who have been some of the most sought-after acts with the rise of the Amapiano genre in neighbouring South Africa, will be making their debut appearance in Bulawayo. Sir Trill is known for his John Wick song while Felo Le Tee was popularised by his Dipatje and 66 hits. The trio will be flanked by local acts, Mlungu Omnyama, Deeper Mr Stripes, Crazy Dee, MTKay Ntwana, Milo The Movement and many more. – @eMKlass_49
