The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief POLICE in Matabeleland South Province have launched a manhunt for a man who teamed up with a friend and fatally assaulted his employer for paying him little money in Mayobodo, Plumtree District. Gift Ndebele who was employed as a herdsman allegedly teamed up with a friend Comfort Nkomo and fatally assaulted Mrs Munzara Mushoriwa whom they accused of paying Ndebele a very little as salary. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident saying the pair struck the victim several times on the head with an axe and she died on the spot. “Police in Mayobodo arrested Comfort Nkomo (22) in connection with a case of murder which occurred at Lumawe Village on March 3 at about 10AM. The suspect together with his accomplice Gift Ndebele who is still at large, allegedly attacked Munzara Mushoriwa (62) on allegations of paying Ndebele little money. The suspects struck the victim several times on the head with an axe and she died on the spot.  A manhunt to account for the remaining suspect has since been launched,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He urged members of the public to resolve conflict amicably adding that the police were engaged in awareness campaigns whereby members of the public were encouraged to iron out their issues in a non-violent manner. “As we speak officers commanding provinces throughout the country are engaging traditional leaders who include chiefs to talk about murder cases, rape cases, robbery cases and other crimes. The message is focused mainly on promoting peace, safety and resolving conflict without resorting to violence,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said the Police Victim Friendly Unit was complementing this by handling issues to do with violence against women and children. “We have community relations liaison officers who are tasked mainly with conducting such campaigns and engaging community leaders,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. — @Yolisswa
