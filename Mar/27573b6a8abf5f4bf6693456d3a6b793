THE road to the African Senior Championships (ASC) begins at White City Stadium on Saturday with the country’s top athletes converging for the inter-club track and field selection meet.  The inter-club track and field championship will be a selection competition for athletes for the Africa Senior Championship to be held in Mauritius in June, World Champs to be held in the USA in July and World Juniors to be held in Colombia in August. Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) says it’s ready to host the event. “We are excited to be hosting this selection meet on Saturday. The numbers in terms of those who have registered is quite encouraging. It is our hope that we will see the best of the country’s talent this coming weekend,” said Bab chairperson Watson Madanyika. Bab has also set April 23-24 for its second basic athletics coach training course conducted by Vusumuzi Mlilo at White City Stadium targeting school teachers, who are the primary handlers of budding talent. Mlilo is a World Athletics Sprints and Hurdles Level 2 Certificate holder and one of Bab’s top coaches. “We discovered that most guys who train at schools don’t have basic skills needed to properly train our youngsters. Therefore, the main targets are school teachers, senior athletes, club coaches without qualifications and college and university students,” said Madanyika. “We want to tap into the talent in our institutions by making sure they get proper training. The basic course teaches talent identification, designing a training programme, safety, skills and how to become a good coach/manager and many other critical aspects. “We need to train more coaches so that each coach can be in a position to at least produce one exceptional talent annually.” – @innocentskizoe
