DYNAMOS have become the first club this season to be summoned to appear before the Premier Soccer League disciplinary committee for their fan’s hooliganism during a league match against Bulawayo Chiefs at Barbourfields Stadium on March 5. They have been charged with violating Order 31 of the PSL rules and regulations and will know their fate on March 29. While DeMbare emerged 2-0 winners on the day after a tactical performance, there were disturbing scenes before and during the match; first by some of their players followed by hooliganism at the Mpilo End stand, which housed the Dynamos fans. In both cases, defender Godknows Zizou Murwira tried to calm tempers to no avail. Before kick-off, Dynamos players provocatively tried to warm-up in the Amakhosi half causing some fracas between them and the home team’s marshals.  It took the arrival of Murwira on the pitch to quell the situation after he urged his players to return to their own half. However, three players ignored his pleas and continued to jog around in the Chiefs half. During the match Dynamos supporters constantly remonstrated with referee Hardly Ndazi and when he later awarded the home side a penalty at the Mpilo End, all hell broke loose. Missiles reigned on the pitch, while some hooligans stormed the pitch and one fan was arrested for confronting Ndazi on the pitch. “Dynamos have been summoned to a disciplinary hearing on the 29th of March at the PSL offices,” said PSL spokesperson Kudzai Bare. In terms of Order 31 of the Castle Lager PSL rules and regulations, it is an act of misconduct on the part of the club where its supporters misbehave in any manner whatsoever, inside or outside a ground before, during or after a match, no matter on which ground the match is played.
