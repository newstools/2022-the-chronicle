RAPPER Gigi Lamayne, Busiswa and Makhadzi on Friday celebrated Women’s Month the best way they know how through the release of a song titled Mashonisa. Gigi Lamayne, who was born in South Africa but is of Zimbabwean descent, said the song was a celebration of women’s emancipation and coincides well with the Women’s Month of March. “Mashonisa is a celebration of Women’s Month. It’s about the strong and able woman who gets back up no matter what life has thrown at her. I want to be remembered as the ‘die-hard’ woman who rolled with grace and resilience. I think that is the alter ego of every woman,” Gigi said. According to Gigi, the song draws attention to the story of omashonisa (loan sharks) who lend people money but on a relationship tip. She said she believes women contribute equally as men. <img class="wp-image-596162 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Makhadzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Makhadzi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Makhadzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Makhadzi “The song is about the strong metro-sexual woman living in 2022 who looks for genuine love and affection. She is looking for a partner who will care for and spoil her even though she is more than capable of doing so for herself and him. “No more ‘tinder swindling’ gentlemen. I am not your loan shark. We both contribute to our life story,” she said. Gigi Lamayne narrated how she met “pioneers for women in entertainment” Busiswa and Makhadzi, citing prior projects and having known Busiswa for a while. “I’ve always known Busiswa. She is an amazing soul and I’ve admired her for the longest time. I met Makhadzi when she initially wanted me to be on her song on her previous project. She was infectious and I really wanted to work with her again.  “Musically we were all different but similar in the sense that we are all setting the bar in our respective roles as pioneers for women in entertainment,” said Gigi. Gigi, who recently accepted her calling as a sangoma said the reception of the song has been great and her fans should expect more from her moving forward. “I’m gobsmacked. I’m really proud of the strides we’ve made so far. People have received it well, even dubbing it a ‘classic’ on the first listen. I knew the #GigiGang would be anticipating and wanted me to drop again and here we are. The album drops next month. Mashonisa is only the beginning.” – @eMKlass_49
