Musicians of one the oldest genres of our time, imbube, are set to be honoured next month as an appreciation of the role that they have played locally and internationally in making known the culture of African people. Imbube is traditional choral music sung without the use of instruments. In its initial stages, it was largely sung by men. However, nowadays imbube has transformed as it is now also being sung by females who have given it a flair of attention it deserves. In order to celebrate imbube legends, Thobela Arts Foundation has organised a show that will be held at the Bulawayo Theatre on April 8. The event will run under the theme, “Honouring Imbube Legends”. Thobela Arts Foundation director Oscar Siziba who also leads Indosakusa: The Morning Star, said a number of Imbube legends will be given their roses. “Imbube is one of the oldest genres that has enhanced recognition of the art of Africans and therefore needs to be recognised. The show will honour legends who include Black Umfolosi, Sunduza, Insingizi, Imbizo, Black Spear, Zondamthakathi, Ubuntu Bomuntu, Umdumo Wesizwe, Phephindaba and Amabhubesi,” said Siziba. He said the event to honour the legends has been long overdue.  “Our imbube legends have never been honoured before hence this decision. We grew up listening to their music and attending their shows but no one has honoured them,” said Siziba. He said the legends will on the day be presented with gifts while a number of imbube groups will perform. “We’ll celebrate our culture by wearing traditional attires. Event attendees can also follow suit although it’s not compulsory. Performances will come from Sunduza Dance Theatre, lndosakusa: The morning star, Great stars Ijongosi, Men of influence, Zondamthakathi, UMkhonto ovuthayo, Indosakusa junior stars and Ditengteng happy Boys,” he said. If all goes according to plan, Siziba said the event will be held annually. – @mthabisi_mthire
