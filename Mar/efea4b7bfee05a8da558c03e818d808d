The Chronicle TYSON Fury says he will retire after next month’s defence of his WBC title against fellow British heavyweight Dillian Whyte in London, stating he has “nothing to prove”. The unbeaten two-time world champion was expected to face the winner of Anthony Joshua’s rematch with Oleksandr Usyk, the holder of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, in a unification bout should he beat Whyte.  But after Tuesday’s news conference to promote the fight on April 23 at Wembley Stadium, Fury, who has hinted at walking away from boxing before, said he would be “fully retired after the fight”. “What I want to do after boxing is chill on a beach, drink pina coladas, drive Ferraris and live on boats and that’s it,” said the 33-year-old. “That’s what I’ll do.” When asked if he harboured ambitions of challenging Joshua or Usyk, he reaffirmed that he would be retiring “100 percent”.- AFP
