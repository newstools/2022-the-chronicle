AMBITIOUS Zifa Southern Region Division One side Talen Vision is reportedly eager to buy the franchise of Premier Soccer League outfit Bulawayo City.  Sources very close to the Filabusi-based side, whose principals are into mining, said Talen Vision and Bulawayo City have started preliminary talks although the final position lies with the Bulawayo City Councillors. “Talks have apparently commenced,” said a source who is close to the two parties.
Bulawayo City chairman Jerry Sibanda said while nothing official has come to them with regards to the purchase, they had no powers as an executive to seal deals of such magnitude. “The club is the brainchild of a council resolution and if it’s to be sold, another resolution to that effect has to be made by the owners of the team, who are the councillors but at the moment there is nothing on the table,” said Sibanda. Talen Vision president Khumbulani Nkomo neither confirmed nor denied that they were eyeing the City franchise. “Is it for sale? We have not heard anything,” said Nkomo. Talen Vision, under Lizwe Sweswe, are eighth on the Southern Region standings from eight games, having managed two wins while Bulawayo City are 15th in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League with a single win from six matches. Talen Vision came into existence in 2013 after purchasing the Otrick Spares franchise. They were initially meant to be known as Talent Vision but a lapse in concentration by the registration clerk resulted in the t being left out and the directors were somehow content hence the name Talen Vision. The team is using players aged below 23 having done away with the old guard during the days of football inactivity due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
