The Chronicle SWISS billionaire Hansjorg Wyss claims he has been offered the chance to buy Chelsea, as parliament hears that Roman Abramovich is hastily selling his UK properties. The 86-year-old has admitted interest in purchasing the Stamford Bridge club from Abramovich, but only as part of a consortium.  Russian-Israeli billionaire Abramovich is understood to want to retain his ownership of Chelsea, but that could effectively prove close to impossible should the UK government impose sanctions on the 55-year-old, who has owned the west London club since 2003. “Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly,” Mr Wyss told Swiss newspaper Blick. “I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. “You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. As of today, we don’t know the exact selling price. “I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. “But what I can already say: I’m definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” Sky Sports News understands that Chelsea is not for sale. Labour MP Chris Bryant used parliamentary privilege to also reveal that Abramovich is selling his UK home and another flat, telling the House of Commons the Russian billionaire is “terrified of being sanctioned”. Sky Sports News has approached Chelsea and Abramovich’s representatives for a response. – Sky Sports
