Local giants Highlanders and Dynamos are expecting to take delivery of their Sakunda Holdings and On the Balls Looks branded kits at the end of this month, more than six months after clinching the multi-million dollar sponsorship deal with the energy giant. The two giants have been using NetOne branded kits. OTB Looks and the two clubs signed a US$300 000 technical partnership in 2020. In separate interviews, both clubs said they designed their kits which Sakunda Holdings then paid for. “Everything is in place, manufacturing has been done, payments done all that is left is for the goods to come down something which we expect to happen by the end of this month,” said acting Highlanders chief executive officer Ronald Moyo.  DeMbare chairman Isaiah Mupfurutsa echoed the same sentiments. “Remember OTB had already supplied us with kits then Sakunda came along before other kits were due from OTB. We had to negotiate with Sakunda to buy us kits and replicas with their logo and brand. A new order was then done.We are informed they are in transit now and we expect them end of this month. Our kits are tailor made and not from ready stock. Production started when we had done the designs so that takes time as well. The movement of the consigment from the manufacturers to us has also been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mupfurutsa.
