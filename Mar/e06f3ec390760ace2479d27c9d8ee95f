SEVENTY MDC-T members dumped their party and joined Zanu-PF during a rally held in Luveve suburb in Bulawayo on Sunday citing ill-treatment by the opposition party. Addressing a rally at Banda Park in Luveve suburb, Zanu-PF Bulawayo Political Commissar Cde Ruth Shelton, said the opposition MDC has not done anything for the people since its formation more than 20 years ago hence people were leaving it.
She said instead the party has destroyed Bulawayo. Cde Shelton said she appreciates the work being done by President Mnangagwa’s Government as people have started enjoying the benefits of the development projects being implemented by Central Government in the city. “I am happy that residents are realising that it is important to elect an MP or councillor representing the party that delivers and this is Zanu-PF.  The President says ‘nyika inovakwa nevene vayo, ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo.’ The opposition has been confusing our people by making false promises for a long time,” she said. Cde Shelton said the party’s membership was growing rapidly and soon Luveve will be a party district. “We are a party with an ideology and with structures so new members should always feel welcome. We always have projects to empower the people as opposed to waiting for handouts like what is being promised by the opposition parties,” she said after welcoming the new members. Cde Shelton said the “Buya ekhaya” campaign which has seen many former Zanu-PF members who had joined opposition parties returning to join the ruling party, was continuing.
