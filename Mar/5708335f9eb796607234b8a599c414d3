BULAWAYO-based Sensei Branco Manyathela has been named lead instructor for the Shukokai Karate Academy (SKA) recently launched in Zimbabwe. SKA is led by chief instructors, Senseis Chris and Katie Simpson. It is a karate academy with headquarters in Kent, England, teaching children from the age of four to adults. They have instructors and students with world and European karate titles and are affiliated to the English Karate Federation (EKF).  Shukokai is known for its high stances, scientific approach to body mechanics and hard-hitting technique. Chojiro Tani brought pad-work into karate for the first time, blending the art-form with modern equipment, while maintaining the traditional Kihon and Kata. Shukokai has spread its wings to various countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, becoming one of the biggest single-style organisations in the world. “Sensei Chris and Sensei Katie Simpson, joint chief instructors of the Shukokai Karate Academy, are proud to announce that they now have an affiliate in Zimbabwe. Manyathela has joined the Shukokai Karate Academy and will work closely alongside Sensei Chris and Sensei Katie to further develop Shukokai Karate in Zimbabwe,” SKA said in a statement. Reacting to his new role, Manyathela said: “We are excited because we are the first SKA affiliate country outside England. For now, our headquarters at national level are in Bulawayo. Our club has 29 members for now and we are happy that the girl child is also represented. Most of our members are between the ages of eight to 15. We also intend to take the sport to schools.” Sensei Katie Simpson, who has represented England in Shukokai karate for over 20 years, medalling at every tournament, has fundraised karate suits for Zimbabwean karatekas before, as part of her efforts to help improve karate standards in the country. – @innocentskizoe
