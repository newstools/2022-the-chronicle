PROVINCIAL Affairs and Devolution Ministers have expressed reservations over recommendations made under the draft National Comprehensive Gender Sensitive Land Policy framework during a meeting in Bulawayo yesterday where stakeholders gave their input on issues they want addressed. The policy is guided by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines for Responsible Governance of Tenure (VGGT) and will be aligned with the African Union Framework Agenda 2063 and guidelines on land policy in Africa. The ministers said they were not included in similar consultative processes, which took place prior to drafting of the policy framework. <img class="wp-image-593644 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Judith-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Judith-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Judith-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Judith Ncube Some of the recommendations contained in the document, which the ministers are opposed to include the disbanding of provincial and district land committees, which were formed during the fast-track land reform programme. Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Richard Moyo said land issues are very sensitive hence they should be handled with utmost care. “To say we will disband provincial and district land committees at this stage is too early. To exclude us as Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution from land issues is a non-starter given that people will continue to come to our offices in the event of disputes as they fall under us,” he said. Minister Moyo also expressed concern over some people who are holding onto offer letters without showing commitment to engage in farming.  “The issue of people who were given land 22 years ago, but never bothered to take up that offer yet we have youths, women and the disabled who need land should be addressed in that land policy framework. We should repossess that land and give it to our youths or even downsize farms because we have some individuals with more than one farm,” he said. “We have a lot of youths and women who should be considered when it comes to land and that should be looked into.” Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube said the policy should also address the issue of compensating black farmers whose farms were acquired by the State during the land reform programme. She also spoke about the need to address the issue of land reserved for Bulawayo’s expansion. The local authority recently revealed that they will be commissioning a detailed study to examine the land uses in the 40-kilometre zone, determining agricultural productive areas, suitability for future urban development. Minister Ncube said already Umguza Rural District Council has started taking up part of the land which falls within the city’s 40km radius.  She said the policy should make it clear that the land belongs to Bulawayo City Council. “We are saying the land policy should address those issues given that part of the land set aside for the expansion of Bulawayo is classified under Umguza RDC, which has already started developing it,” she said. The Minister of State for Mashonaland Central Provincial Affairs Senator Monica Mavhunga was also opposed to the issue of disbandment of provincial and district land committees. “We feel it’s too early to disband land committees at provincial and district levels because they are transparent when it comes to dealing with land related issues and disputes. What should actually be done is dealing with land barons and compensation for landscaping for development,” she said.  The minister said the policy must address land issues holistically with aspects that include land tenure, access to land, land use planning, land information management, land dispute resolution, environmental sustainability management, management of wildlife, forestry and water being taken into consideration. — @mashnnets
