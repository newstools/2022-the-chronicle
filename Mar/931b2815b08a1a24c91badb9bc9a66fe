THE Government has approved a $1,1 billion 2022 budget for Shurugwi Town Council, up from $490 million last year.  Residents expect improved service delivery as money to fund most of the town’s capital projects will be  provided by the Central Government through Devolution Funds, grants and loans. Shurugwi Town Council director of finance Mr Charles Tawonezvi confirmed the development. “Our $1,1 billion budget has been approved and this development will see tariffs going up by 30 percent. More than 50 percent of the revenue will fund water and sanitation projects as well as road construction and rehabilitation,” said Mr Tawonezvi. Shurugwi’s high density suburbs have been experiencing water shortages for years because the town’s pumping capacity has not been increased to match the growing population. Recently, the council completed the Mambowa Water Supply Project to boost the suburb’s water supplies. The local authority is looking forward to improving the RB East Water Project, which is also going to improve water supply in the town. The council is also planning to work on its roads under the Emergency Roads Rehabilitation Programme. “We expect about $800 million to fund capital projects to come from central Government as Devolution Funds”, said Mr Tawonezvi. Council is also looking forward to improving service delivery through partnerships and outsourcing some services.
