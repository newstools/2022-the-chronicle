SPORT has the power to unite and help develop youth to become responsible citizens in society. This was said by Moses Langa, the Zanu-PF Matabeleland South Youth League chairman on the sidelines of a netball and football tournament at Zhimpale Village, Insiza South, last Sunday. The tournament pitted six football teams from the surrounding villages of Maluju, Silalabuhwa, Marubamba, Nyamime, Zhimpale and Ntunte. This was part of an initiative to encourage talented youths to display their talents and expose themselves to possible life-changing opportunities. <img class="wp-image-595384 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-18-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-18-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-18-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jubilation at Insiza South sports festival organised by Zanu-PF Mat South Youth League chairman Cde Moses Langa Langa has been at the core of mobilising communities in Insiza district to hold as many sporting activities as possible in a bid to distract young talents from bad behaviour. His call to “catch them young” is driven by concern of the rampant alcohol and drug abuse scourge currently ravishing many young talented Zimbabweans. “We are emphasising that sport is the only vehicle that can bring young people together. It’s a platform where they are able to showcase their talent to the world. <img class="alignnone wp-image-595386 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-19-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-19-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-19-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The reason we organised this sports extravaganza is driven by the need to group our youth and bring them to the core of talent development,” said Langa. “What comes out is a successful talent development programme that not only works on the individual, but the whole country. Sport is a conduit to enlightenment, development and progress. This is what we are bringing to Insiza district. I’m sure if we continue on the same path, we might unearth gems of sporting talent in the greater Matabeleland South.”  Action at the event started off at midday, with Nyamime Village teams posing a threat right from the start. It was no surprise when Nyamime Village emerged as champions of the football tournament, beating Zhimpale Stars 2-1, while Sibasa women took the crown in the netball hoops. The abundance of talent in the village tournament proved that some teams in the Castle Lager Premiership ought to scout for talent in outlying areas instead of only concentrating in urban areas. — @innocentskizoe
