KWEKWE Polytechnic has started enrolling students for its Gokwe campus, with lectures set to begin next month. The college partnered with Gokwe Vocational Training Centre (GVTC), as it seeks to expand its catchment area and serve the Gokwe community in line with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) of not leaving anyone behind. Kwekwe Polytechnic vice-principal Mr Chamusungarevi Gora said enrollment was already underway and lectures will start when all other polytechnical colleges open in April. “We have started enrollment of students for our Gokwe campus and we expect to start lectures on April 26 when the rest of the institutions resume operations,” he said. Mr Gora said they will be introducing courses in phases. “We are introducing the first phase of our courses so that we get a soft landing before we introduce other phases once we settle.  We are currently using GVTC premises so we cannot introduce all our courses at once,” he said. The first phase will focus on courses in the commerce, engineering, applied science as well as adult and continuing education divisions. According to Mr Gora, the college has already secured land for construction of the Gokwe campus. “We have already been offered land and we will start construction very soon. But while we work on those modalities, we will be using GVTC as our campus until such a time we construct our own campus. “We want the people of Gokwe to participate in national development in line with NDS1. Also, in line with Education 5.0 philosophy, we seek to satisfy the component of community development. We hope to provide a platform for every Gokwe resident a chance to access education being accessed by any other child across the country,” he said.
