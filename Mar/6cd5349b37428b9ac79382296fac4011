A 14-year-old Shungu High School pupil in Kwekwe, Takunda Lusinga, who has a chronic kidney disease, is appealing for financial assistance to enable him to have three dialysis sessions a week. A session costs US$150 and Takunda’s aunt, Mrs Joyce Lusinga, said they can’t afford the US$150 per session. “Takunda was diagnosed with the condition on January 14 this year after falling ill. Right now he has stopped going to school because doctors are saying he has to go for dialysis sessions,” said Mrs Lusinga.  She said doctors advised that he should go for dialysis three times a week so needs US$450 a week. “We are therefore appealing to well-wishers to assist us financially so that we can send Takunda for dialysis sessions. Well-wishers can get hold of me on 0719 037633 and my banking details are: ZB Bank, Kwekwe branch, account number 4650580695200, account name Joyce Lusinga,” said Mrs Lusinga.
