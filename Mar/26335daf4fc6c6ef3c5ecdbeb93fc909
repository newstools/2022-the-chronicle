ARENEL Movers coach Kudzayi Mhandire has rejected the “favourites” tag despite his side emerging as one of the in-form sides in the Zifa Southern Region Division One league. His side is second on the league table, a point behind leaders Hwange, who have 17 points.  Arenel saw off Zimbabwe Saints at the weekend to keep track of the coal miners, who appear to have also built a strong squad as they angle for a return to the Premier Soccer League. Mhandire’s charges beat Chikwata 1-0 at White City Stadium on Saturday. “We are far from being favourites. There are a number of good yeams and we are taking each game as it comes. We are slowly getting into shape. Remember we are a side that is coming from relegation. We do not want to put too much pressure on ourselves. When we started, our goal was to survive relegation and that remains the goal for now,” said Mhandire. “Generally l am pleased with what the team has done up to this level. The boys have been impressive. Watching them, you can see that they are slowly getting back into shape,” he said. His side is also in the final of the Wafa Wafa Cup and will face Hwange at the Colliery Stadium on a date yet to be announced. In other Division One league matches played at the weekend, Bosso 90 were at the end of another defeat, falling 1-2 to Indlovu Iyanyathela at Luveve Stadium’s B-arena. This followed a 6-0 mauling by ZPC Hwange last week.Binga Pirates, whose first win came last Saturday at home against Indonsakusa, picked up their second victory of the season, a 3-1 win over Mainline in Plumtree. Also victorious were Casmyn, who beat bottom-placed Ajax Hotspurs 2-1. Talen Vision, the 2019 runners-up played out yet another 1-1 draw against Mosi Rovers in Victoria Falls.
