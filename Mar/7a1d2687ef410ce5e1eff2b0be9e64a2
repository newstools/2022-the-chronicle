ZIFA Southern Region chairman Andrew Tapela says the Wafa Wafa knockout competition final pitting Hwange and Arenel Movers will definitely be played this month at the Colliery Stadium although no concrete date has been set. The final was initially meant to be played before the Division One league programme started, but was pushed back to complete other logistics.  “We are on course with our preparations for the final. I can safely state that the final will be played at the Colliery in the coming weeks. We have not revealed who the tournament sponsor is, but we will be doing that on the day of the final, which will be soon. “We are dealing with a situation where the sponsor has pleaded with us not to reveal them until a given time and we respect that. I can guarantee that the final will be played this month,” said Tapela. Winners of the competition will pocket US$3 000, with losing finalists going home with US$2 000. Meanwhile, Division One league action is set to continue this weekend with table toppers Hwange playing host to Mosi Rovers at the Colliery. Hwange have 17 points while Arenel are second, just a point behind.
