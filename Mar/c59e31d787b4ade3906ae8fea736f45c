The Chronicle Ephesians 1 vs 11 “In Him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will.” So many people wonder what God’s purpose is for their lives. Each of us are born with a calling and purpose that we can discover or completely miss and it’s important to know that His purpose for us is way bigger than our personal success, happiness or satisfaction.  The Bible says He created us to fulfill His purpose therefore what better place to start than to ask Him for revelation and direction? The way God formed you reveals how He wants to use you. If you want to know what you are supposed to do with your life, you have to look intensely at how He wired you; your heart, your spiritual gifts, talents, personality, abilities and the experiences He has given you, that will reveal your purpose. Oftentimes we make the mistake of looking at the next person who is walking in their calling successfully and we want to imitate them and we end up being bitter and frustrated when it doesn’t work out for us. What you need is already in you and once you become intentional about discovering it and aligning it with God’s will, He will ensure that you not only fulfill it for His glory but you prosper from it as well. God has sown the seed in you but the growth and development of it requires perseverance and diligence on your part. Pray that He helps you to stay renewed in Him so that it can be a joy to fulfill your purpose and press through to its completion so that it produces fruit that pleases Him.
Be blessed
