The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter AGRICULTURE-oriented organisation 4-H Zimbabwe has signed a partnership with the Japan Embassy to establish women-led community gardens countrywide, with boreholes that are solar powered. The project seeks to enhance food security and access to clean water in communities. The programme was launched last week in Hurungwe, Mashonaland West with the establishment of eight community gardens.  Other community gardens will be established in Midlands and Matabeleland provinces starting this week. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Japan Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Tanaka Satoshi said the development will also ensure equity in societies. “We like projects that address gender inequalities and we are therefore geared to support rural young women in enhancing climate change resilience innovations that ensure food security. “Such programmes not only uplift societies but ensure woman have a voice in their communities,” said Mr Satoshi. Mr John Muchenje, the 4-H Zimbabwe Director said their target is to enhance resilience in all the 55 rural districts in Zimbabwe. “We want to see communities having access to clean water and sustainable agriculture in the next five years,” said Mr Muchenje. — @mthabisi_mthire
