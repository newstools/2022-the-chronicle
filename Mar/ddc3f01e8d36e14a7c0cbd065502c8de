The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief More than 1 600 pregnant women in the Midlands province tested positive to syphilis last year according to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Child Care. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection. In pregnant women, syphilis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or the baby can die soon after birth.  Approximately 40 percent of babies born to women with untreated syphilis can be stillborn or die from the infection. This was revealed by Midlands provincial reproductive health officer Mr Kupakwashe Madondo when he was making a presentation on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). “According to the provincial syphilis cascade from January to December 2021 a total of 52 364 pregnant women were tested for syphilis and 1 677 tested positive,” said Mr Madondo. He said having sexual intercourse with an infected partner was the major cause. “Prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes offer a range of services for women of reproductive age living with or at risk of HIV. PMTCT services should be offered before conception and throughout pregnancy, labour and breastfeeding. “PMTCT services should include early infant diagnosis at four to six weeks after birth, testing at 18 months or when breastfeeding ends. ART should be initiated as soon as possible for HIV exposed infants,” said Mr Madondo. He said pregnant women with known HIV status were 58 229 while 4 460 didn’t know their status. Mr Madondo said a total of 856 pregnant women tested for HIV for the first time.
