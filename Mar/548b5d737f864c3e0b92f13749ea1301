The Court of Arbitration for Sport has turned down Football Union of Russia’s request to stay, until a full hearing, Uefa’s decision to suspend all Russian teams and clubs from its competitions.  The two parties, CAS and FUR also did not agree to an expedited procedure to hear the case and as such no date has been set as yet. “The president of the Appeals Arbitration Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has denied the request filed by the Football Union of Russia (FUR) to stay, for the duration of the CAS proceedings, the execution of the Uefa executive committee’s decision to suspend all Russian teams and clubs from its competitions until further notice. “Consequently, the Challenged Decision remains in force and all Russian teams and clubs continue to be suspended from participation in Uefa competitions. “The CAS arbitration proceedings continue. The parties did not agree to an expedited procedure and a hearing has not yet been fixed,” read the CAS statement. It said the arbitration proceedings brought by the FUR against the Fifa council’s decisions to suspend all Russian teams and clubs from participation in its competitions until further notice, and to give a “bye” to the team of Poland to the final of “Path B” of the European play-offs for the 2022 Fifa World Cup, due to take place on 29 March 2022 will be issued probably today. “The CAS’s decisions on the FUR’s requests to stay the execution of the Fifa decisions for the duration of the CAS proceedings are likely to be issued at the end of this week,” said CAS. Fifa and Uefa last month suspended Russian teams and clubs from it’s competitions following Russia’s military operation in Ukraine.
