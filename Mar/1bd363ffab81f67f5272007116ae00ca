CIWU FC coach Morris Mukwiti has parted ways with the club citing an unconducive working environment that has made it difficult to produce results. The club is bottom of the Zifa Southern Region Division One League table with three points from eight games, consisting of three draws and five losses. Mukwiti was elevated to the head coach’s role at the beginning of the season after serving in the interim since 2019. “I have amicably parted ways with CIWU FC and I did this for the best interests of the club. Apart from posting poor results, the club totally failed to purchase training equipment since the season started.  Although they kept on promising to take care of our welfare, we were not paid even a cent,” said Mukwiti. “We were struggling and at times had to use a single ball at training, but for the love of football and for the benefit of players, we kept on working hoping that the situation would change for the better. But nothing changed and players were struggling to come for training. There were a lot of challenges and since the Division One league resumed in October 2021, the club owes me five months’ salary.” Meanwhile, Hwange FC dropped points when they were held to a goalless draw by Ratanang at Luveve Stadium’s B-arena on Saturday, which allowed second-placed Arenel to close the gap. – @innocentskizoe
