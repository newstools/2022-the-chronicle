FORMER Mighty Warriors striker Nomusa ‘Boyz’ Moyo has emerged as the sole candidate for the position of Highlanders’ Royals head coach with Nobuhle Majika being a strong contender for the assistant’s post. Sources said the executive has settled for Moyo and is set to give her a five-year contract. Bosso are yet to assemble a ladies’ team, with club chief executive officer Ronald Moyo telling Chronicle Sport “it’s work in progress”. “Nomusa has been speaking to the Highlanders’ leadership for the position and both parties seem to be in agreement. While I am not the executive, I can speak with authority that she is our incoming Highlanders Royals head coach. Plans are in place to also have Nobuhle as her assistant or manager, but obviously everyone is aware that Nobuhle is presently at Amakhosikazi, a Bulawayo Chiefs project where she is assisting Evans Neta, who once coached Highlanders Royals,” said the source.  Both Moyo and Majika could not be reached for comment on the matter as was Royals coordinator Samukeliso Silengane. Meanwhile, Las Palmas have submitted their Covid-19 compliance documents to the Southern Region leadership as preparations for the resumption of the league gather momentum. Regional leagues kicked off two weeks ago, but the Southern Region is yet to get the ball rolling, largely due to the failure by clubs to adhere to Covid-19 requirements. “I can confirm that Las Palmas are the sixth club to submit their documents in line with the Sports and Recreation Commission set conditions. We now have six clubs which are compliant,” said Zimbabwe Women’s Soccer League Southern Region board member, Sibekiwe Ndlovu. Las Palmas joins Ubuntu, ZRP Bulawayo, Street Set, Sobukhazi High School and Amakhosikazi Queens.
