THE Trysupps Zimbabwe Novice BodyBuilding and Fitness Championships has officially been launched, with the event scheduled for March 26 in Harare. This year’s competition is being sponsored by reigning Mr Zimbabwe Men’s Physique Ryan Gumbo through his company TrySupps Zimbabwe in partnership with the National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness. The competition had been shelved until Gumbo stepped in to assist. “When I heard that the competition was likely to be postponed I thought to myself perhaps this was my time to give back to the sport.  Remember we have been out of action for a long time and there is a need to pull out all the stops to ensure we return to our normal programmes. So as TrySupps Zimbabwe we are going to be taking care of the prizes for the winners. We are going to be providing supplement hampers, certificates and medals for the winners,” said Gumbo. “The challenge with bodybuilding is that it starts really paying when you have reached the professional level. Hence others may feel since there is no huge monetary return after winning, they won’t participate. Some of us have gone to regional competitions where you are not given anything besides just a medal. The key thing, however, is that these give one exposure and help you rise through the ranks. “The sport has been kind to me. All the hard work I have put in has yielded results. I want to be an example to upcoming athletes and my partnership with the federation is an appreciation of what the sport gave me in my life.” Gumbo, who recently won the Arnold Classic Championships in South Africa, said the competition will serve as the bodybuilding season opener. The competition will be in the senior men’s bodybuilding, men’s physique, men’s fitness, junior men Under-21 and women’s physique. – @innocentskizoe
