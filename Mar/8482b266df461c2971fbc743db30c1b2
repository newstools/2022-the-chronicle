TWENTY-FIVE youngsters will participate in the inaugural Real Betis Academy Zimbabwe training camp in Bulawayo this morning, as the first step towards identifying and developing talent on behalf of its Spanish principals begins in the city. The academy’s Bulawayo-based coaches, Johannes Ngodzo and Gift Lunga (Junior), who were responsible for selecting the budding stars in the city, will be joined by Murape Murape and Tichaona Diya at the camp to be held at Barbourfields Stadium’s B Ground. Real Betis Zimbabwe president, Gerald Sibanda, whose sports agency Athletes Sphere Management secured the deal to be the Spanish club’s first academy in Africa, said they are excited by the launch, which will be followed by recruitment of more age groups players next week.  “We’ve got 25 players selected by Bulawayo coaches to participate in our training camp. This is mainly the launch of our training camp, more like an exhibition. The recruitment for many other age groups for Bulawayo begins next week. “We are excited to be activating our brand in Bulawayo. We’re grateful to Bulawayo City Council that has given us one of their facilities to use as we launch Real Betis Academy Zimbabwe in Bulawayo. The Bulawayo City Football Club management has also been supportive to ensure that our programme becomes a success,” said Sibanda.
After training, participants will then watch the Premiership clash between Bulawayo City and Triangle United. — @ZililoR
