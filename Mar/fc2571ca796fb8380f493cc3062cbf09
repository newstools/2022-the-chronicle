So, as much as I’m hosting it, I’m excited that I’ll learn a lot of things and will leave a better person. “It’ll be a very interactive platform for everyone to weigh in their thoughts on our bodies irrespective of their size,” Queen Pat said. “We need more of these conversations to remind each other that we are different and diverse people, but amid all of that, we are beautiful and we need to wake up each and every morning acknowledging that. “We should celebrate ourselves and the idea of us being equals and being confident in our own bodies. It will boost our self-esteem,” she said. The model/businesswoman has for a long time, been a voice of change for women, most notably through her movement, I am empress.
