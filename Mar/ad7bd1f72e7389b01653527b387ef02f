HIGHLANDERS are yet to assemble their ladies football side after the previous team that competed in the Southern Region league disbanded following what sources said were irreconcilable differences between the executive and then Bosso Royals overseer Sibekiwe Ndlovu who stood accused of being former chairman, Kenneth Mhlophe’s person. Ndlovu though, has long been very active with the Highlanders Royals even before Mhlophe probably thought of running for the Highlanders chairmanship in 2018. The divisions, according to sources, are said to have been caused by other ladies within the Highlanders membership set-up, some of whom are believed to be part of the newly formed structure that has been mandated with running the ladies football side, if assembled. <img class="wp-image-594618 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Caroline-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Caroline-Ndlovu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Caroline-Ndlovu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Caroline Ndlovu Contacted for comment on the so called differences, Ndlovu said; “I am just taking a break please, I have done my part and all I pray for is that Highlanders Royals become a successful project, nothing else.” Acting chief executive officer Ronald Moyo however, denied that the executive has appointed a committee to run the affairs of women football at the club but did confirm that at the moment, Highlanders Royals was just but a name without any players. “No, we don’t have any players for the Royals at the moment,” said Moyo. The shocking confession by the acting Bosso head of secretariat comes at a time when all ladies sides in the City have been busy training and having friendly matches in preparation of the imminent start of the season.  Southern Region league will be made up of Bulawayo Queens, Magwegwe, New Orleans, Sobukhazi, Biya and Friends Las Palmas, Ubuntu, Highlanders Royals (if they manage to assemble a team) as well as arguably one of the most flamboyant ladies football teams in the country, Amakhosikazi, a Bulawayo Chiefs project. “We are putting in place a structure to carry out the activities of the Highlanders Royals, I am hopeful that by the end of this coming week we would have announced the names. We are actually in the process of identifying those persons, there are no executive members at the moment but there is a Highlanders executive committee that was elected by club members and its this committee that is mandated to see how the Highlanders Royals are run,” said Moyo during a press conference yesterday. <img class="wp-image-594620 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Sibekiwe-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Sibekiwe-Ndlovu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Sibekiwe-Ndlovu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sibekiwe Ndlovu Chronicle Sport is however, reliably informed that veteran administrator Samukeliso Silengane, city businesswoman and philanthropist Caroline Ndlovu, another businesswoman who is in the hospitality industry Amanda Sidambe, Kholiwe Ncube as well as Bongi Msimanga have been mandated to run the affairs of Highlanders Royals. Former Mighty Warriors skipper Nomsa Boyz Moyo is being earmarked for the coach’s role. “The club may deny that a structure is already in place but what is known is that these guys (new committee) have been holding marathon meetings with Highlanders Royals being their agenda,” said a source yesterday.
