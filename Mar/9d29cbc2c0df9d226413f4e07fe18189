ENTREPRENEURS should embrace the values of integrity, honesty and hard work in order to make big business impact and contribute to national development. Business Economic Empowerment Forum (BEEF) president, Mr Solomon Matsa, said this in Bulawayo during a business interactive gathering on Tuesday evening. He said success in business requires proper organisation and being able to develop a good network while working closely with other stakeholders, including the Government. “Propose more honest ways of doing business and run a well-managed business with integrity, hard work, honest and teamwork. As BEEF we don’t work with criminals,” said Mr Matsa.  He said the Government has come up with many strategies to capacite businesses, which include issuing of tenders, empowerment projects and financing avenues through selected entities. Mr Matsa said proper business management requires formalisation, which takes into account issues such as tax clearance certification and being registered with bodies like the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ). “Our people are not focused and organised because as we are speaking, Government issues weekly tenders but the citizens are not going for the opportunities and these end up being taken by outsiders,” he said. “Business people in Zimbabwe should find ways of partnering so that they work together and grow their businesses. “For those who have business ideas, just do a bankable plan and as BEEF we are there to assist you to get the funding.” Speaking at the same event, BEEF vice president Mr Mpumelelo Phiri who is also the owner of Ngamla Professionals, a business based in Bulawayo, said people who want to own businesses should not be lazy. Mr Phiri said BEEF was there to give guidance, mentorship and training to people who want to engage in business and grow and urged Matabeleland businesses to also take part in full. — @sikhulekelaniM1
