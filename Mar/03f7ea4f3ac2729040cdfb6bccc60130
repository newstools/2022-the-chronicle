The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter GWANDA-based gospel songstress Sandra Sibanda has rebranded to the name Ukukhanya eAfrica as she moves to market her art beyond the borders. As she eyes growing with her rebranded name, the Qoki hit-maker has tracks that she is planning to release in the coming months. Ukukhanya eAfrica said the rebranding exercise has been imminent taking note that in the field there is also a powerful female songstress by the name Sandra Ndebele. “Ukukhanya eAfrica has always been my motto. In my previous songs, it’s written on the covers thus I saw it fit to use it as my stage name as it’s catchy, full of life, and prophetic. We have Sandra Ndebele already in the field so using a different name is ideal,” said Ukukhanya eAfrica. She said she has quite a lot of things planned this year that are meant to ensure her visibility is undisturbed. “I’m still deciding on which tracks to drop first because I have a couple of songs ready, but my intuition tells me I should go with a song called Ladocea and another called Indonga zeJericho. – @mthabisi_mthire
