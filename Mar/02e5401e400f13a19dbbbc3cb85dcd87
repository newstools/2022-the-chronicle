A FOUR-YEAR-OLD died and 24 other people were injured in an accident involving three vehicles near Nkulumane complex on Tuesday morning.  Two kombis that were travelling along Khami road were involved in a collision with a Toyota Hilux at an  intersection near the complex. The four-year-old girl sustained serious injuries and died while being rushed to hospital.
Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said a Toyota Hilux hit a kombi which crashed into another kombi at the intersection. “We have recorded a fatal accident in Bulawayo along Khami road at an intersection near Nkulumane complex. An open truck hit a Zupco-registered kombi which rolled hitting another kombi resulting in 25 people being injured including the four-year-old who later died,” he said. A Chronicle news crew that visited the accident scene found police officers and Fire and Ambulance Services officers clearing the road and cleaning blood that was all over. An eyewitness and local resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said the intersection was now a black spot as many accidents were happening there. The witness said this was probably because the traffic lights at the intersection have not been functioning for a long time.
