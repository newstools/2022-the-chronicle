HIGHLANDERS are not losing sleep over reports that former striker Joel Luphahla is being courted by either Ngezi Platinum Stars or FC Platinum. Bosso were expecting Dubai, as Luphahla was nicknamed during his playing days, to arrive in Bulawayo around yesterday morning and believe the rumour mill could have been set in motion when the former Golden Eagles coach did not arrive at the agreed time and was seen in Harare at the expected time of arrival. Luphahla told Chronicle Sport just after midday that he was on his way to Bulawayo to take up his new role as second assistant coach to Mandla Mpofu. “Nothing has changed from what the executive secretary announced through a statement on Tuesday.  As far as we are concerned, Joel Luphahla is our assistant coach and he should be joining the rest of the team soon,” said Bosso’s newly appointed chief executive officer Ronald Moyo. According to a source, the two platinum sides had dangled much more lucrative offers even before Luphahla had parted ways with the Zifa Northern Region Division One side, but he was still undecided until Highlanders came knocking. “The two parties met at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday to finalise a few sticking points and the rest is history. A statement was issued by Golden Eagles the next morning announcing the two parties’ separation on mutual agreement,” said the source.
