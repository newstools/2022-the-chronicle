HIGHLANDERS Volleyball Club have declared their readiness for the upcoming Bulawayo Volleyball Association Preseason Open tournament set for White City Stadium this weekend. The tournament was initially set for last weekend, but was pushed back due to some administrative challenges. There was also the issue of the venue after it clashed with the ZRP Commissioner General’s Sports Gala. “We have been preparing hard for this tournament and are content with what the guys are doing on the court as we countdown to the event. I believe we are ready for the opener and are looking forward to doing well,” said Highlanders’ coach Wellington Hwata. He said they are likely to get stiff competition from Spartans, Black Rhinos and Shalom.  The Open is set to have more than 10 teams from Bulawayo and outside the city. The club has also taken advantage of the tournament by inviting the corporate world to erect banners and billboards at the venue to advertise their products. Highlanders Volleyball Club marketing administrator Proud Dube said the move is also aimed at selling their brand to the business community. “On behalf of Highlanders Volleyball Club marketing team, we are inviting your company/organisation to come and advertise your products at the upcoming Bulawayo Volleyball Tournament that will be held at White City Stadium from the 19th-20th of March 2022. The tournament is hosted by Bulawayo Volleyball Association. This special time will benefit your company/organisation and Highlanders Volleyball Club, as we are pushing for sponsorship for the upcoming volleyball league,” wrote Dube in his invitation letter.
