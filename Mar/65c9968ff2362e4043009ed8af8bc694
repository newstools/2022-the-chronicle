THE past year has seen an increased interest in professional photoshoots among urbanites and a significant growth in the business. This trend can be traced back to the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. With their movements restricted, people turned to social media to capture their moments and to remain in touch with day-to-day activities. Families spent a lot of time together and most could not help, but capture these moments with their smartphones and post them on various social media platforms. As soon as they could move around after the lockdown was relaxed, people became fond of professional photoshoots. These photoshoots have presented families with an opportunity to celebrate life and events such as birthdays, weddings, family gatherings baby showers, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and graduations among others. Modern-day technology now allows people to instantly share these moments with the rest of the world using various social media platforms. Unlike in the past when pictures were printed and filed in albums, people are now storing them in digital form. <img class="size-full wp-image-593764" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mthokozisi-Bhebhe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mthokozisi-Bhebhe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mthokozisi-Bhebhe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mthokozisi Bhebhe Dorcas Siziba from Gwanda said she developed a liking for photoshoots during the peak of the pandemic. She said they were an effective way for her to create lasting memories which even her grandchildren could see one day. “In the past, I wasn’t a photogenic person, but I developed a liking for pictures during the Covid-19 pandemic. We were spending a lot of time at home and we couldn’t move around. I started taking pictures of myself and my family using my cell phone and I would post them on social media. “When the lockdown was relaxed I then moved on to having professional photoshoots,” she said. Siziba added: “The pandemic has taught me to celebrate life more and capture as many moments as I can with my family. I enjoy taking pictures with my family to celebrate events or just for fun. I post them on platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook and I know that my children and my grand children will be able to view these pictures in the next years to come.” She said she sometimes takes pictures to capture other moments such as when she buys a new outfit or when her family members visit her. Siziba said she prefers to use a professional photographer and not to take her own pictures using her cell phone in order to get quality images. Another lover of photoshoots, Princess Moyo from Bulawayo said an event such as a birthday celebration cannot be complete without a photoshoot. <img class="size-full wp-image-593765" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Shepherd-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Shepherd-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Shepherd-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Shepherd Ncube “I love photoshoots and for me, a celebration isn’t complete if we don’t take pictures. Gone are the days when we used to take poor-quality pictures. We now want good quality pictures which means we engage professional photographers. “I don’t mind forking out the money because capturing these precious moments with my family and friends is important,” she said. Gwanda-based photographer, Mthokozisi Bhebhe who operates under the trade name MTK Sharpshooter said the photography industry had greatly evolved over the years and was now in high demand. He said he started photography in 2003. At that time, he said it could take him a week or two to fill up one film which accommodated 36 pictures. Once he had filled up the film, he would bring it to Bulawayo for printing and then upon his return, people would collect their printed photos. Bhebhe said at that time, people hardly took pictures for luxury purposes. “Then, people used to take pictures for events such as weddings, graduations, prize-giving days and a few others. Being a photographer was really tricky because you’d only have one shot and you had to get it right. There was no option of viewing the pictures or deleting them from the camera. “Each picture only had one shot and the customer could only see their photo after it had been printed,” he said. Bhebhe said the equipment has greatly improved, something that has made photography more interesting and easier. He said the love for photoshoots among people has also grown. On a good day, Bhebhe said he can process about 500 pictures, especially during weekends. “People no longer take pictures for events only as some take pictures just to trend, for instance, if they have a new outfit or as a couple, or friends. Some of our customers are business owners that will be marketing their products online. Now, people mostly collect their pictures digitally while a few want them printed as portraits to use on their walls,” he said.  In order to keep up with evolving and unique needs of clients, Bhebhe said as a photographer, he has to be creative. He said each photoshoot should be theme-based on the event and the preference of the client. Some clients, Bhebhe said prefer outdoor pictures while others prefer studio shoots. He added that photographers nowadays need to invest in good equipment to avoid being overtaken by smart phones. Shepherd Ncube, a Bulawayo-based photographer operating under the name Nine Studios said many people developed a liking for photoshoots during the Covid-19 era. He said there has also been an increase in lifestyle photoshoots. He said clothing stores in the CBD have also been awarding tenders to local photographers to market their clothing lines. Small boutiques have also not been left out as they are making use of photographers in order to market their products online. “More and more people are getting into photography which means that there’s an increased demand for customers. I’m constantly researching new ideas online so that I remain relevant. I also post pictures of my clients online so that I can help them trend and also market my work,” he said. — @DubeMatutu
