Elegance defines the ambiance of the recently refurbished Bulawayo nightclub, Cosmopolitan.
True to its name, the new look is sure to offer top-notch service to patrons who desire a more stylish hangout in a city that is famed for its multicultural complex.  The nightclub officially opened for business yesterday with a party dubbed “The New Look Friday”. For the past six years, many nightlife enthusiasts got used to the club and were loyal too. The old Cosmopolitan with its red-toned colour stood its place in the entertainment and leisure industry, but it had to make way for the new. The new-look establishment is set to wow and merrymakers will definitely love it. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595872" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-11-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-11-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-11-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The facelift of the place took two weeks of hard work and creativity. From the look of it, the renovation has given a fresh start to the spot situated at the Ascot Racecourse, which has been extended, redesigned and rebranded. Shades of green, black and navy blue are now the colours that identify Cosmopolitan, a sister club to Zarah Lounge, Crystal, Cubana and Havanna Cigar Lounge. It used to host patrons in the evening, however, the new Cosmopolitan which is trending on social media courtesy of its refurbished fresh look, now has a different clientele model altogether. A restaurant, spit braai and tshisanyama have been added on the list of the services Cosmopolitan already offered. The club prides itself on its motto, “Because You’re Worth It”. Officially opening the new-look joint, proprietor Phathisani Nkomo said the rebranding was to fulfil the promise of maintaining the premium status of the nightclub. “This is such a rare occasion where Bulawayo socialites, media practitioners, and loyal customers are gathered in one place to celebrate the re-opening of Cosmopolitan which always strives to give topnotch entertainment and services to our diversified clientele. “It took two weeks to renovate this place and as you can see from the look, we made sure that we move with time and re-design Cosmo and turn it into a modern place that meets international standards. “Just like the motto says ‘Because You Are Worth It,’ we value our customers by giving them quality services that are worth their hard-earned money,” said Nkomo. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595875" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-12-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-12-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-12-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ntando Ndlovu who is the marketing consultant for Cosmopolitan and founder of KBM Agency echoed Nkomo’s sentiments emphasising that the old Cosmopolitan served its time and it was high time that the club gets a new look. “With the nightclub industry you get to a period of three to five years and after that, you always have to refresh and give the place a new extra touch because clients will get tired of seeing the same thing. Remember you want to entertain not to bore people. So, Cosmo had reached that stage and it was time for it to be renovated and freshen up its promise of being a premium club,” said Ndlovu. He said in coming up with the new concept, they aimed at making Cosmopolitan the club of choice. “We pushed ourselves to the limit and afforded to give Cosmo a face of any mighty club you can find in the world, it’s not just a Bulawayo club, it’s a Cosmopolitan that can compete with giant competitors from all over the world. “As we now have a new identity, we added a restaurant with professional chefs and a tshisanyama on top of our services. This will allow patrons who prefer to enjoy their time in the afternoons to experience such kind of services with their loved ones,” said Ndlovu. He said Cosmopolitan will be open every Thursday to Sunday from 6PM to 11PM, in respect of the Covid-19 induced curfew. However, plans of opening the club in the afternoon are on the cards, as a way of accommodating those who would like to chill and experience the cool breeze during the day. Apart from drinks, food always complements any restaurant and taking care of that department will be Phumulani Msipha who comes in as the head chef of Cosmopolitan, assisted by chef Thando Mackenzie. Msipha who previously was a chef at Holiday Inn and Carne Casa, said his kitchen has everything to meet the demands of any patron. “The major highlight of our kitchen will be the spit braai that we will be having every day at Cosmopolitan. We will be having lamb, pork, chicken and so on. “We also have a diversified menu that will meet different tastes of our cosmopolitan clientele. We will have Cosmo specials on burgers, chicken and chips and so on,” said Msipha.
