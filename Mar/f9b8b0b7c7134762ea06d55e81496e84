The Chronicle Wedding of Mandlenkosi Moyo, the son of Mlamuli Moyo and Venitter Moyo; and Nomaqhawe Ndlovu the third daughter of Tobias Ndlovu and Nonhlanhla Ndlovu. We chose . . . Lavinia Gardens in Waterford, Bulawayo for our wedding ceremony and reception because of the beautiful scenic view and convenience of the location.  How did you meet?
We met at a club in South Africa on December 24, 2012. I was out with my sister when Mandla saw me and asked me to join him for a dance. I gladly did and later on that night, we exchanged numbers. He called the following morning and that’s when the meet-ups started. We have been together ever since and never looked back. Our traditional lobola ceremony was in September last year. Did you face any challenges preparing for the wedding?
Yes, we did, our main challenge was the Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions but we took the risk anyway because we knew we serve a living God so we put everything in his hands. December 24 was our chosen date and we couldn’t change it for anything even if 10 guests were to attend, we were still okay with it. Wedding colours . . . we chose white, gold and emerald green. The bridal team had . . . five gentlemen and five ladies with Desmond Moyo as the best man and the best girl being Nobukhosi Nkomazana. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594746" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/weddinmg-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/weddinmg-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/weddinmg-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The cake . . . was a five-tier gold and white fruit cake baked by Heavenly Creations. My favourite part of the wedding . . . was when we had our first dance, it meant a lot to me. The most touching moment . . . was when I walked down the aisle and my husband got all emotional. The most touching speech . . . was when he confirmed his marriage vows to me and told me how much he loved me and promised to be the best husband and father of our kids. What was on the menu?
The main meal comprised of yellow basmati rice and pap. Coated chicken and beef stew were served with creamed spinach and cinnamon butternut. The salads were coleslaw, chakalaka and beetroot then we had cake for dessert. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594747" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/cake.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/cake.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/cake-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Guest list . . . 100.
