Following the successful showcase of the country’s arts and culture by Sandra Ndebele and Songs of Lozikeyi in Dubai, another group from Bulawayo, Umkhathi Theatre Works is in India where they are representing the country at the Surajkund International Crafts Mela. The award-winning group left the country last Friday for the festival that started on Saturday and will end on April 4. Touted as the world’s largest craft fair, the Surajkund International Crafts Mela is an annual event that returned this year after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. <img class="wp-image-596288 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Umkhathi-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Umkhathi-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Umkhathi-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Umkhathi Theatre Works Umkhathi Theatre Works travelled with 10 members, Matesu Dube, Ishmael Muvingi, Maqhawe Moyo, Fidelis Tshuma, Hebson Chigodora Ncube, Martin Khumalo, Dumisani Sibanda, Lorin Sibanda, Beauty Matshawila and Patience Maseko.
