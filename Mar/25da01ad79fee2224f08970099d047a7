Asked about the significance of his visit and the Zimbabwe National Day, the President said it was important for Zimbabwe to be afforded a chance to showcase opportunities for cooperation and investment. “At the exhibition, you are able to learn what other countries are doing, and they are also able to learn what opportunities exist in your country.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595417" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> On trade between Zimbabwe and the UAE, President Mnangagwa highlighted that trade between the two countries was US$1,4 in 2020, and after two years it has jumped to US$1,6 billion. “Trade between the two countries has been growing fast and above that we have a close relationship,” he said. In 2019, President Mnangagwa paid a three-day State visit to the UAE but on the second day he had to cut short his visit after Cyclone Idai hit the country with devastating effect, causing over 300 deaths and massive destruction to property. “But I am happy that when Cyclone Idai hit us, the UAE sent two planes with loads of material assistance, which went a long way in mitigating the effects of the cyclone.”  The Zimbabwean leader, who has upped his engagement and reengagement crusade as part of his drive to grow Zimbabwe’s economy also held two interactive sessions with the Zimbabwe diaspora community living in UAE and international business leaders. The business leaders forum was organised by the Zimbabwe Investment Development Agency where testimonials by business leaders gave a thumbs up to the Second Republic’s efforts in creating a conducive environment for investment. The President was welcomed at the Robert Mugabe International Airport by Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Defence and War Veterans Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe, Cabinet ministers, service chiefs and other senior Government officials.
