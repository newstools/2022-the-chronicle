LOCAL human portraitist Ngqabutho Khumalo has lamented the shut down of the “The Big Boys” show at the Bulawayo Hockey Stadium on Sunday as he says this disturbed his conversation with Cassper Nyovest.  The shutdown was a result of Kumalo residents who live near the stadium complaining of noise as well as lockdown regulations. Police then stopped the show. <img class="size-full wp-image-593356" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cassper-Nyovest-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cassper-Nyovest-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cassper-Nyovest-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cassper Nyovest Due to this disruption, the human portraitist who had made a portrait of Cassper felt robbed of a chance to engage fully with the South African rapper. “I had a lot to discuss with Cassper Nyovest. After I showed him his portrait, we were to get into the nitty-gritty and police shut down the whole thing, robbing me of a chance to network fully with Cassper,” he said. Khumalo rose to fame last year after attending the Big Zulu show at The Boundary where he presented the SA rapper with a portrait of the star. When he left the mining town of Gwanda and traded it for the hustle and bustle of Bulawayo, Khumalo had one thing in mind, “chase my dreams of being the best human portraitist around.” To back up his claim, the National Annual Science Sports and Arts Festival (NASSAF) 2019 competition winner has drawn a lot of celebrities in his career who include Cassper Nyovest, Makhadzi, Big Zulu and the late, Cal Vin. His portraits have gained a lot of traction and he said he is starting to reap the rewards of his handiwork. “Last year, I extended a plea for help with drawing equipment and in as much as I haven’t gotten help in that regard, things are looking up. A lot of people have contacted me for portraits and that is a sign of progress. “I’d also like to thank organisers of events who have made sure that I gain free entry to shows so that I meet the icons that I draw. I appreciate the love and support I’m getting,” he said. Khumalo’s exploits have seen individuals taking to social media to plead a case for him and implore members of the public to support local talent. – @eMKlass_49
