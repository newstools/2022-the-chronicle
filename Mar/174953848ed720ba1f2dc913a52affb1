THE National Darts Association of Zimbabwe (Ndaz) has greenlighted its provincial affiliates to start league matches under strict Covid-19 health guidelines. The game, like other sport codes in the country, has been in limbo since the outbreak of Covid-19 two years ago, which forced Government to freeze public gatherings and sporting activities to help contain the spread of the virus. Harare province has already started league matches and Bulawayo is set to follow suit at the beginning of next month. Ndaz president Meynard Moyo said Covid-19 health guidelines and protocols are, however, still not easy for some clubs and provinces to follow, but they have no option as they are non-negotiable. “We have opened up the provinces to start their games. Some have started, but some are still putting up final touches. It’s, however, not easy given the new changes and coming from a long lay-off,” said Moyo. He said the new normal under Covid-19 protocols requires teams and players to quickly adapt.  Meanwhile, Bulawayo Metropolitan Darts Association chairman Lethukuthula Nkomo said they were seized with preparations for resumption of league matches. “At the moment we are still mobilising teams and making sure they are Covid-19 protocol compliant. We expect to have at least 13 teams in our league,” said Nkomo. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, darts’ popularity was on the ascendency, with active participation in schools, which included it in their extra curriculum activities.
