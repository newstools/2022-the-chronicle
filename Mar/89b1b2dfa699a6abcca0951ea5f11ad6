THE Zifa Restructuring Committee has appointed an international audit firm to conduct a forensic audit of Zifa books and property and report within 90 days. BDO Zimbabwe Chartered Accountants, who are experts in the financial field and have offices in the United Kingdom, have been engaged to audit the national association amid strong indications of rampant financial mismanagement and corruption by the suspended Zifa executive committee.  The Sports and Recreation Commission slapped Zifa president Felton Kamambo and his executive committee with indefinite suspension in November last year over a litany of charges. Zifa Restructuring Committee chairperson Blessing Rugara confirmed that BDO Zimbabwe Chartered Accountants had been engaged to conduct a forensic audit of the national association. He said his team was currently gathering as much information as possible from interested parties and they will pursue all relevant fronts in their commitment to cleaning Zimbabwe football, which has been badly damaged by allegations of corruption, maladministration, sexual harrassment as well as match fixing. “We are currently in the information gathering and investigation phase. We continue to meet with interested parties on many fronts relating to football in Zimbabwe,” said Rugara. “We will pursue all relevant fronts deliberately and in accordance with our phased approach. “We will be updating the media and the public in due course as we move into our recommendations phase,” he said. Other members of the restructuring committee, appointed by the SRC in December last year, are Zimpapers board chairperson and sport administration expert Tommy Sithole, bankers Desmond Ali and Joel Gombera, former Zimbabwe Olympic Committee chief executive officer Anna Mguni, ex-Caps United administrator Joyce Kapota, lawyer Rudo Mugandani, football administrator Brian Busani Moyo and former Caps United defender Charles Sibanda.
