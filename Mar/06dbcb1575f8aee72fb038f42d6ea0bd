The Chronicle Psalm 106:28-31
They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor, And ate sacrifices made to the dead. Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them. Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, And the plague was stopped. And that was accounted to him for righteousness To all generations forevermore. (NKJV) What is a Plague?
It’s a spiritual dark cloud of a contagious disease characterised by fever, delirium, and lack of vaccine solution for some time, very infectious and it causes thousands of deaths, serious damage, continual trouble, distress and poverty. This happens when a people or nation provoke God to anger/wrath by evil deeds and He then removes his hedge of protection and plagues the people. It happened in the Bible. God allowed 10 plagues in Egypt and there were more than 7 on earth which were recorded in the bible. When I was praying to God, I asked God why corona has come into the world, why do we have this plague called Covid-19 that you are seeing today that is killing people. As I was fasting and praying and the Holy Spirit said to me “Anytime when I plague the earth with something that is a perilous pestilence they would have provoked me somewhere”. Plagues don’t just come without God being provoked to anger. The reason why God has plagued the world today it is because the world has started to commit the Numbers 25 sin of sexual immorality. If this sin is not going to stop and Christians are not going to rise up in prayer for homosexuality to die, God said I will do it myself with plagues. There are always thousands of people that die due to a plague that happens in a nation. There is a plague that has broken out in the world and as the body of Christ we can stop coronavirus but there are things that we need to know and do as the church. The church must not sleep; it is high time the church rises like what Phinehas did.
