Zanu-PF Bulawayo Province (Greens District/City Centre) chairman and Affirmative Action Group (AAG) head of IT and logistics for the province Cde Tendai Charuka is set to spoil himself with a birthday party today at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre.  Cde Charuka, who is turning 39, said the party is open to everyone. Among guests set to grace the event are Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube, Zanu-PF Bulawayo provincial chairman Cde Jabulani Sibanda, veteran politician and Zanu-PF Politburo member Retired Colonel Tshinga Dube, Zanu-PF Central Committee member and Bulawayo Senator Molly Mpofu. Also on the guest list is preacher, socialite, entrepreneur, music promoter and author Passion Java. On his last trip to Bulawayo recently, Java donated various foodstuffs to underprivileged people in the city. “I want to celebrate my birthday in style. I want to host people that have contributed to the emancipation of our country. Here we will also share ideas on how to bolster Vision 2030. We are the future and should be patriotic at all costs. I am expecting at least 4 000 guests to grace the occasion. There are three beasts that will be slaughtered and an overflow of refreshments,” said Cde Charuka. He said the party will also be used to attract votes to the ruling party in Bulawayo, especially from the youth. Cde Charuka said he had already booked and paid for the venue and engaged Delta Beverages to supply refreshments. He also said a variety of artistes will perform at the gig. “The likes of Chief Hwenje, Chase Skuza and a long list of local artistes will perform at the event. If there are any other artistes that wish to showcase their talent, they can come through,” said Cde Charuka. He indicated that there would be strict observance of Covid-19 protocols as well as tight security.
