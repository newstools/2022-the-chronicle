The Chronicle Tafadzwa Muronzwa Nothing defines destiny like mentality. Instructed by nature imperative by learning that’s how I can describe the well balanced movie. The movie had the right amount of comic relief without making any of the scenes feel unnatural. It flowed like water. Best Subtext with comedic perfection, warmth, vulnerability and the synergy between young Adam Reed played by Walker Scobell and grown up Adam Reed played by Ryan Reynolds, an outstanding actor. Overall the movie is a very well-crafted action adventure-sci-fi with a powerful, exceptional cinematography done by Tobias Schliessler and well scripted with unique amazing characters that include Ryan Reynolds, Jennifer Garner, Zoe Saldana, Walker Scobell and Mark Buffalo. All these actors give their best. This film deserves your time on a weekend and it is a must watch. <img class="size-full wp-image-596493" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dog-movie.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dog-movie.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dog-movie-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The movie has an underlying message on how veterans are treated in America My Review on Dog the Movie Heart-warming, for every loss there’s something to be found, that’s how I describe this movie. It has an underlying message on how veterans are treated in America. An excellent portrayal of what the aftermath of war does to some heroic veterans (PTSD, traumatic injuries, personal and families post combat conflicts). Also the related anxiety effects on a service Dog. It’s a story that can’t help but to tap into your emotions. It’s was amazing to watch how Lulu the Dog and the Army Ranger played by Channing Tatum get along trying to survive war. I was really amused and amazed by the very distinct hard hitting scenes but wow what a fantastic performance by the Dog and absolute performance by Channing Tatum who completely handled this with professionalism. To see how Channing Tatum is amazing he also co-directed the movie with Director Reid Carolin. This is an entertaining movie you won’t forget in a hurry.
