The Sports and Recreation Commission is seized with the Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (BUZ) election chaos following alleged irregularities raised by Harare Basketball Association as well as losing secretary general candidate Sunny Mbofana.  The tension filled elections, held on January 29 at Mtshabezi High School in Matabeleland South, saw incumbents Joe Mukuru and Charmaine Chamboko retaining their president and secretary general posts respectively, an outcome that was challenged by both HBA and Mbofana. Mujuru and Chamboko are accused of allegedly contravening the SRC’s code of good governance by acting as an election commission during the elections. They are also being accused of illegally barring Mashonaland Central from participating, as well as bringing in “bogus and fraudulent” delegates to represent the National Association of Primary Heads (NAPH). However, Mashonaland Central delegates never raised a complaint over their barring while Naph leadership have also since said they have no issue with what transpired at the elective annual general meeting, especially on the delegate who represented them. “The matter is under active consideration by the SRC and have activated processes to address the issues raised,” said acting director general Sebastian Garikai. The two complainants want the result of the elections nullified with Mbofana incredibly saying he must be declared as the duly elected Buz secretary general despite polling the same number of votes, three, as his co-challenger Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu.
