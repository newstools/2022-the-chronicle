President Mnangagwa is set to grace the Presidential Independence Day Trophy match pitting the country’s most bitter football rivals Dynamos and Highlanders. The 42nd Independence Day main celebrations will be held in Bulawayo on April 18 for the first time ever and will mark the return of public festivities since 2019 after the 2020 and 2021 celebrations were shelved due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The President will hand over the trophy to the winners.  This year’s Independence Day celebrations will be held under the theme: “Zim@ 42- Leaving no one and no place behind” in line with the Second Republic’s drive towards the promotion of national unity, devolution and decentralisation. In his post Cabinet briefing yesterday, Acting Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu said: “His Excellency the President will grace the soccer match between Highlanders and Dynamos Football Clubs and hand over the Presidential Independence Day Trophy to the winner.”
