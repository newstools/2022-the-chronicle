The Chronicle YOUR ability to persist in the face of setbacks and disappointments determines the measure of your belief in yourself and your ability to succeed. Persistence is the steely quality of success, a significant virtue and asset a businessperson should possess. What separates you from everyone else is your ability to persevere through setbacks and to move on with tenacity when everyone else has given up. Avoid a short cut mentality at all costs.  Galatians 6:9
Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. (NIV) A seemingly impossible situation is the perfect setting for a miracle! I have learnt the lesson that persistence breaks resistance. “Never give in, never give up!” Sir Winston Churchill is considered perhaps to be the greatest statesman of the 20th century because of his willingness to endure without complaining and to hold on insistently in the midst of what seemed to be certain defeat and failure. In life, winners are not always the most intelligent, neither the most artistic or adept; but a sure way of laying hold of the prize is to be persistent. Luke 18: 1-7
Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not lose heart, saying: “There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man. Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, ‘Get justice for me from my adversary.’ And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, ‘Though I do not fear God nor regard man, yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.”’ Then the Lord said, “Hear what the unjust judge said. And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them? (NKJV) God Bless. eaglelifeassembly@yahoo.com
