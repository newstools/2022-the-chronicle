The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter SOUTH African Afro-pop duo Blaq Diamond will be back in Bulawayo for the second time as they are set to share the stage with fellow South African acts, Sir Trill, Felo Le Tee and Sjava on Sunday. The last time the duo performed in Bulawayo was in December at Umguza Yacht Club. The Summer Block Party will see lovers of Amapiano and Afro-pop converge at Eyadini to see the quartet perform. Before performing in Bulawayo, Blaq Diamond will grace The Phoenix Shinsanyama in Gwanda on Saturday. Fast-growing events promotion company, Fife Street Events are the ones organising the block party. Event organiser, Junior Mbanje said everything is on course and the show is getting bigger as they keep on adding more acts. “The event is getting bigger and bigger as we’ve roped in Blaq Diamond into the mix. We’re so excited to have them on board as they’re one of the most sought-after duos around,” said Mbanje. Lately, shows have been marred by ugly and embarrassing scenes due to kicking off late, but Mbanje said they would try and get it right this time and avoid police shutting down the event. “We’re putting our house in order to avoid previous mistakes. We heard the call from patrons to start our shows early and yes, we’ll definitely do so this time around. The show will start in the afternoon with a variety of local artistes taking turns to warm up the stage and keep patrons entertained. “Then, later on, we’ll have the international acts shut it down. All this will happen before curfew time to avoid any disappointments and a brush with the law,” said Mbanje. Sjava and Blaq Diamond are well known for songs such as Umama and Summer Yomuthi while Sir Trill is known for his song John Wick. Felo Le Tee was popularised by his Dipatje and 66 hits. The quartet will be flanked by local acts, Mlungu Omnyama, Deeper Mr Stripes, Crazy Dee, MTKay Ntwana and Milo The Movement. – @eMKlass_49
