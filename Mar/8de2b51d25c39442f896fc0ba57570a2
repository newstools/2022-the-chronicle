HIGHLANDERS head coach Mandla Mpofu has hailed Nqobizitha Masuku’s “maturity” and revealed that he is building his side around the central midfielder.  Masuku, who has developed from a combative defensive linkman into a regular goal scorer, was on the score sheet when Bosso beat Yadah 3-0 in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. It was Masuku’s fifth goal in eight appearances this season. He has scored three set pieces and two from open play. <img class="wp-image-597345 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu There is no denying that he is the man carrying Bosso on his shoulders at present. “He has done well for us and himself. He is in good form and showing great leadership qualities. It tells me that he has matured as a player. l am building the team around him. He is showing great leadership skills,” said Mpofu. “I wish he continues assisting the team to win. The other good thing about him is that he is a team player and a fighter and that is good for the club,” he said. Despite the impressive margin of victory on Sunday, Mpofu admitted that his side’s display was not that convincing. “We are happy with winning at home, it gives us a bit of confidence. We want to make Barboufields a fortress as l have been saying. It gives further confidence. We were sloppy in terms of our ball retention and circulation, but overall we showed character. I am happy for the team,” he said. Mpofu was also pleased that his two strikers Lynoth Chikuhwa and Washington Navaya scored and hopes the floodgates will open for his main striker Stanley Ngala, who has scored only once. “I think it’s natural that he is getting frustrated. He wants to score everytime. We need to talk to him and psych him. l am sure he will score soon; it’s only a matter of time. He is a hard working boy and l am happy with the contribution he brings to the team,” said Mpofu. Having taken a day off yesterday, Bosso will regroup today to start preparations for their next assignment against Triangle FC. Highlanders are now 10th on the league table with 12 points; 10 behind table toppers Chicken Inn. – @innocentskizoe
