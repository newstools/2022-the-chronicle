BULAWAYO Chiefs face the hard task of ending their five-match winless run when they take on Black Rhinos in Mutare this afternoon without head coach Nilton Terroso, who is attending a Uefa Pro-Licence class. Terroso flew to his native Portugal on Monday, a day after watching Chiefs going down 1-2 to Harare City at home. That defeat left Chiefs languishing in 12th place on the league table with nine points, just three points above the relegation zone. The Ninjas are hard-pressed to stop their downward spiral after recording only one win this year. Since their stunning 2-0 win over reigning champions FC Platinum in February, they have only bagged two points out of a possible 15. Dumisani Mantula-Sibanda, Chiefs’ secretary, said Terroso will be back in time for their Match Day 10 home clash with Ngezi Platinum Stars, which he might watch from the terraces.  “The coach (Terroso) flew to Portugal on Monday for a prior engagement that he had informed us about earlier on. He is attending a capacity building programme, Uefa Pro-Licence, which we believe will also help the team. This is not the only time that he’ll be away. After this he will be excused twice or thrice during the year. “He will miss our next game against Black Rhinos, but he should be back towards the end of next week. So, in essence he might not be on the bench for two games as he might choose to allow his assistants to take charge of the Ngezi Platinum Stars game and watch from the terraces,” said Mantula-Sibanda. Physical performance analyser Pouria Jarrahi, assistant coaches Mark Mathe and Farai Tawachera, goalkeepers’ trainer Nkosi Sibanda and fitness trainer Abraham Mbayiwa will be in charge of the team against Rhinos. -@ZililoR
