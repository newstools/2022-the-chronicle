BUSINESSES should thrive to provide best customer service to enhance their brand marketing whose impact must ride on positive client impressions. This demands that businesses invest more on raising awareness and training of their staff on key customer handling ethics, says Contact Centre Association of Zimbabwe (CCAZ) marketing executive for southern region, Miss Nyarai Viriri. She said adoption of customer centric approaches was critical for economic progress hence her organisation has come up with a programme to incentivise those businesses that excel in customer care. “We encourage all stakeholders and businesses to engage in massive customer centric trainings so that we have the best customer service,” she said.  “Happy and satisfied customers are biggest advocates and can become most successful sales team.”
CCAZ is set to host its 6th edition of Southern Region Service Excellence Award to be held in Bulawayo this Friday. “We have nominated organisations in different disciplines through a vote by members of the public based on good customer services,” she said. “We advise companies to also find out about their customers, ask them what they want and do research as market surveys can be very useful for a broader marketing vision.” Miss Viriri said one of their surveys has shown that customer satisfaction in Bulawayo was hovering around 60 percent, above the national average of about 52 percent. CCAZ is a professional industry body formed in 2010 with a goal to promote and cultivate a culture of service excellence and upholding customer service standards and values as key ingredients for the development of industry and the economy at large. The organisation does these through conducting trainings, workshops, customer satisfaction surveys and related industrial research programmes that benchmark customer service quality to international standards.
