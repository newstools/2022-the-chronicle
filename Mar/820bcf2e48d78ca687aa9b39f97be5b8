Khulu Richard Mpabanga Ncube’s birthday party was hosted and sponsored by a local organisation, SPA Community Trust at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre in Bulawayo. Originally from Matopo, he lives in Bulawayo’s Barbourfields suburb with some of his grandchildren.  He went to Lozikeyi Primary School in Nguboyenga suburb back in the day and then proceeded to Empandeni Mission in Plumtree to further his studies. <img class="alignnone wp-image-595620 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khulu Ncube said in the 1940s he worked for Chronicle. “I worked at Chronicle in the 1940s, delivering newspapers. We would come in at 6:30am before workers could get into their offices. We would cycle from office to office delivering the papers, and we made sure that everyone found their newspaper in their office.  After the delivery we were paid our commission daily, and received our salaries per fortnight. After that I worked for the municipality for a very long time,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-595625 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-4-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-4-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-4-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I met my wife in those years, when she was still learning at Thekwane High School in Plumtree. We had eight children, and my wife passed away in 2000, after that I never remarried, actually I have never thought of it.” He said his love for his sweetheart made him not to remarry after she died. Khulu Ncube is a father to three boys and five girls. Three of his children are now late.  He said he has more than 28 grandchildren, more than 30 great grandchildren, as well as a number of great-great-grandchildren. Khulu Ncube’s secret to long life is respect and creating no enemies. “If you want to live longer just respect your elders and even those younger than you. Avoid stress by not creating any enemies, and trust me God will reward you with many more years on this earth,” he said. “I feel so happy that I’ve reached this age while I can still talk, see, hear, write and even walk upright with the help of a walking aid. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595623" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-3-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-3-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-3-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It’s all God’s grace.” Khulu Ncube said he is grateful that he survived all the deadly diseases that have existed in his lifetime, including Covid-19, surviving some of them by virtue of good behaviour and morality. “I survived a lot of deadly diseases which took away a lot of our friends and relatives, influenza, iskwaribhana (chicken pox), gonorrhea, and others up to this Covid-19. I’m glad I’m still here,” he said. According to him, the deadliest disease in his lifetime was gonorrhea.  He said his immune system remains strong due to eating indigenous fruits back in the days. He commended the way parents raised their children long back. “Our parents raised us so well in a strict manner, they would beat us with umklampunzi and we would never repeat the same mistake again and again. <img class="alignnone wp-image-595626 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-5-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-5-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-5-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> I remember that we would not sleep at home as long as we did not find all the cattle. We ate amagonsi similar to sweet potatoes, and a lot of indigenous fruits which kept our immune system clean,” he said. The centenarian said although his ID says he was born on March 16, 1921, he was actually born three years earlier on March 16, 1918, as there was a mistake in recording. The old man has chosen to stick to what is on his ID. Khulu Ncube’s fifth born child, Ms Beauty Ncube was overwhelmed to see her father reaching another milestone. “I’m over the moon to see my father reaching this age in this state, he is a star. He couldn’t even sleep waiting for his birthday. He is someone who loves attending such joyous events, as he is free spirited. I’m so proud to call him my father, and that he has lived to see his grandchildren and great grandchildren,” she said. “After the death of our mother, I don’t think remarrying ever crossed his mind. I actually thought he would follow her, give up or something because their love was so strong, but here he is 22 years later. He has always been a family man, who raised us so well. Most of us are abroad all thanks to him.” Khulu Ncube’s longtime friend, 93-year-old, Mr Richard Gadlula said Khulu Ncube is one person he trusts. “I wish my friend more years, so that when I reach the age, he has reached he will be there for me. He is more like a brother to me. I take all my burdens to him and he has always been there. Ncube is a good man,” he said. Khulu’s birthday celebration was graced by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Judith Ncube. “It is good that nowadays people live longer and healthier lives than ever before. More and more people are living up to 100 years and beyond. Having centenarians within our society is a good and treasured resource which helps us understand where we came from and where we want to be,” she said. Minister Ncube urged the youth to copy Khulu Ncube’s recipe to long life by respecting every elderly member of the community. “These elderly people play a key role in teaching our youths cultural values and preserving tradition as they are the custodians of a rich cultural heritage. Although their bodies may be becoming weak and frail, they have immense experience and wisdom which we should tap into,” she said.
