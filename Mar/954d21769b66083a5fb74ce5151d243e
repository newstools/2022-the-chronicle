CAPS United have been criticised for having assembled a squad that is full of spent forces but coach Lloyd Chitembwe is happy with how his players have responded to the mockery. It’s now safe to say Makepekepe have picked up a new nickname in the form of “Old Peoples Home.” While that may sound insulting, Caps United fans and players have embraced it and this was evident when they beat Bulawayo City 1-0 at Barbourfields Stadium in a league encounter on Saturday. At full-time the players and fans belted into song whose lyrics was clear the fans had come to back Chitembwe’s old guard. “Initially people were mocking us as spent forces and that we are a team with over aged players but I am happy that the boys have taken the criticism positively. I hope they will continue in the same vein,” said Chitembwe. He also hailed the fans who sang throughout the encounter backing his old guard. “The fans are very special, we always try to give them something to smile and cheer about,” he said.
Commenting on the league he said: “It’s way too early.  The league is in its infancy. We still have a long way to go. We are not looking at what will happen after 20 games at this moment.” Veteran William Manondo scored Caps United’s solitary goal.
The goal moved his goal scoring tally to six having scored a hat-trick last week when Caps United beat  Whawha by six goals. Their recent victory on the road could be statement that the Whawha result was no    fluke. Some of the veterans in Chitembwe’s books include on fire Manondo, Ronald Chitiyo, Rodwell Chinyengetere, Marshall Machazane, Dennis Dauda and Jimmy Dzingai. Caps United’s next fixture will be at home when they welcome Highlanders. — @innocentskizoe
