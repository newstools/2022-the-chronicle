The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Chronicle Reporter A misunderstanding between a husband and wife in Matabeleland South’s Esigodini area took a violent turn after the 36-year-old woman “splashed” boiling cooking oil on her spouse. This was one of three attempted murder cases recorded by police in Zimbabwe over three days. Yvonne Muunganirwa splashed hot cooking oil on her husband Tapiwa Muunganirwa (43) at Mbalabala, Esigodini after a misunderstanding. In the second case, a man from Lupane, Matabeleland North axed another after the latter’s cattle strayed on the former’s fields. In the same province, in Nkayi, a man stabbed two other men with an okapi knife and empty bottle. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-490379" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/axe-F.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/axe-F.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/axe-F-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Posting on their Twitter page, police said Muunganirwa attacked her husband on Friday last week. “The ZRP reiterates that members of the public must resolve their differences without the use of violence.
