HIGHLANDERS’ chiefs insist that Sunday’s result against CAPS United in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League will have no bearing on the fate of head coach Mandla Mpofu.  According to reports, Mpofu was given a target of seven points from three games after Bosso’s 0-1 loss to Bulawayo City. Since then, he has picked up four points after forcing a nil-all draw with Tenax and a 4-0 demolition of Herentals. He will, therefore, have to beat Makepekepe to survive the chop, according to speculation. Highlanders, however, say no such targets have been set for Mpofu. “I am not aware of any other targets besides the ones that are already there which stipulate that the coach should win matches with the end goal being winning the championship. I think that is clear and it’s in the public domain. The target for the coaches is to win games like they did last week; hopefully they do it again against Caps United,” said Highlanders acting chief executive officer Ronald Moyo. “Any other targets besides what I have mentioned, Highlanders is not aware of. The immediate target is to win matches with the bigger picture being to win the championship. We are behind the coaches and we are giving them the support which they deserve. After the Caps United game, we are making arrangements for the coach to also watch the Yadah game at Baobab. We are supporting the technical team so that they get the results we want.” The 4-0 victory against Herentals has given Mpofu hope going forward and he is looking forward to his next game against Makepekepe at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. – @innocentskizoe
