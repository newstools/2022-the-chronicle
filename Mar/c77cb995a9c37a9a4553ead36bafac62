PENDING by-elections have forced the cancellation of the start of the Women’s Super League season that has been in limbo for more than 24 months. League matches were last played in 2019 and with plans already underway for the 2020 season, the world of sport was heavily affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, which forced governments to take drastic measures to contain the pandemic. These included halting all sporting activities, as mass gatherings were identified as super spreaders. Vaccination saw a decline in the number of cases and the world eventually started to slowly open up. “We had initially planned to start our season on March 26, but because of the by-elections we decided to move the kick-off date to April 2, 2022,” said women’s football boss Barbara Chikosi.  She said the league will comprise 16 teams, which have all confirmed their readiness. Reigning champions Black Rhinos Queens, Yadah Queens, Black Mambas Queens, Correctional Queens, Conduit Soccer Academy, Harare City and Herentals Queens are the Harare-based sides, while Burrow Jets and Hearts of Oak are the two teams from Bulawayo. From Mutare there are Faith Drive and Mutare City Rovers, while Midlands State University Queens, Chipembere Queens as well as Chapungu Queens are based in Gweru, with Scorpion Queens from Chegutu being the only side from Mashonaland West province. Meanwhile, teams in the Southern Region women’s league led by Takundwa Chimundiya are still in the dark about the season’s kick-off despite indications that all of them, except Highlanders Royals, are ready for action. Clubs have been organising friendly matches to fine tune their squads for what promises to be an exciting season, with a number of tension filled matches as the ladies try to outsmart each other for bragging rights.
