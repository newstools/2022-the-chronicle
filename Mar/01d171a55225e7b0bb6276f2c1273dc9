IGNATIUS Mteketeke has opened a commanding eight shot lead at the Maxi Golf Open at Bulawayo Golf Club (BGC) after shooting 5 under in round two of the major. On the opening day on Thursday, Mteketeke shot another round of 67.  Mteketeke who plays out of BGC continued his incredible form hitting 67 on his way to the commanding lead. The Maxi Open leader hit six birdies in this round to go 10 under after the first two days. It was not all smooth sailing for Mteketeke who bogeyed his first hole before two birdies in the front nine and four in the back nine extended his lead. “The course has been good to me and after only one bogey in the front nine, I managed four birdies in the back nine with no bogeys,” said a confident Mteketeke. South African, Ricky Handler is in the frame eight shots behind Mteketede after two rounds of 72 on day one and 70 on day two. Handler struggled with the par five holes but began his second round with two birdies but double bogeyed on eighth hole, birdied the 10th and 11th holes. “It was tough day with the wind, but I managed to stay patient and calm. I hope tomorrow I can scare Ignatius with a better game of golf. Tomorrow I am going after Ignatius for the win,” declared Handler. “This is my first time at Bulawayo Golf Club but it’s a fabulous course with a nice layout. A little tough though,” added Handler. Handler is tied for second with Paulo Sobriero who shot an even 72 yesterday. Nyasha Muyambo dropped away from the lead after shooting 74. His first round of 69 put him two shots behind Mteketede after the first round, but day two saw him fall to nine shots behind the tournament leader. BGC resident pro, Brian Gondo shot 73 in the second round leaving him 1 over after two rounds. Gondo and Muyambo are tied for fourth on the leaderboard. A representative of the tournament’s sponsors, Benson Chiripanhura said they were happy with the tournament thus far. He said they were worried about the weather holding out in the first two days in spite of windy conditions and occasional showers. “We are happy with the way the tounament has progressed.
