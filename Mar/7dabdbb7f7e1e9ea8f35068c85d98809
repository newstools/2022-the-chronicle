Legends band, fronted by two former Mokis Connection Super Sounds members Josiah Nswabanda Nkomo and Phikile Samathwala Bhebhe, has released a single which is a teaser to their forthcoming album.  The album titled Ikhuba leny’ indoda, is a confirmation that the pair has great potential to contribute to the growth of the Rhumba music. The artistes, who are managed and sponsored by South Africa-based Cain Leon Ndebele, are set to release their first joint album under new management in October. Samathwala became famous for his wheelbarrow dancing antics and lead vocals on some of Mokis Connection’s albums. “Our last album was released in 2020 under Nswabanda and since Samathwala joined the band, we haven’t yet given our fans an album. We introduced him during the live shows we did last year and so this single track is to warm them up,” said Ndebele. He said the duo will release a six-track album in October at the Hillbrow Theatre in South Africa. “We know that the Easter holiday is beckoning so we wanted to give our fans something to enjoy while we prepare the full album. Some of the songs on the new album are Ikhuba leny’ indoda, Mamazala, Buloyi and Ndorindori,” Ndebele said. After the launch of the album, Ndebele said the duo will host a number of shows locally in November.  The Legends band’s last album was titled Ngihluphekile.
