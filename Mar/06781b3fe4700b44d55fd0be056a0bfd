The Chronicle Proverbs 16 vs 3
“Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.” ISN’T it amazing how our dreams and aspirations change or grow over time? When you look back at your life ten or five years ago and what you wanted then, you’ve probably achieved or acquired it by now and you are focusing on the next bigger and better goal.  Doesn’t this prove how faithful God is? He listens to our prayers and He makes our dreams come true. We are constantly growing and improving, so are our aspirations. Sometimes you look back at something that inspired you or that you really wished for years ago and you ask yourself, but was I really dreaming that small? But that is the beauty of life, it’s a constant progressive journey where you keep discovering more, causing you to reach for more and to push and challenge yourself to get better. Through it all we must remain thankful and grateful. In as much as you must keep moving forward, you must also not despise the small beginnings. You should always take time to reflect; look back at where you started from and thank God for getting you here today. Life is a journey of both small and big steps, one after the other, all leading you towards your destiny. Even the steps you feel you took backwards were part of the journey. We learn as we grow, we make mistakes and we correct them and move on, and each step makes us better and brings us closer to our purpose. Our Lord is a faithful God, He set out a plan for your life before you were born and if you align your choices with His will, He will guide you to the place where your dreams come true, for His glory and His Kingdom.
Be blessed.
