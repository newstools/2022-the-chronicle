LISTED beverages producer, Delta Corporation, says it is focused on consolidating its market share following the official launch of its new product, Sable Lager, in Bulawayo last Friday.  The new product joins several other beverages by the company that are already being consumed by the market such as Castle Lager, Black Label Beer, Lion Lager and Zambezi. Packaged in a brown bottle, with blue labelling, Sable Lager was introduced to the market at a local venue, which was booked out with attendance of Bulawayo business executives, politicians and several other socialites. According to Delta, Sable is an “easy drinking experience reminiscent of premium brands but obtainable at a lower price point for its mixed-gender consumers”. This is part of the giant company’s strategy to consolidate its dominant market share and have more women consuming the product at affordable cost, said Delta marketing manager lagers, Ms Kundayi Mawema. “We seized this opportunity and through research and validation ensured that it would be lucrative for the business and our traders and definitely worth pursuing,” she said. “Sable Lager is a proudly mixed-gender brand made for both men and women to enjoy confidently, with the ease of knowing that their needs will be addressed with a smooth easy drinking beer.”
