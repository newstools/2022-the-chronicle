THE Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) has announced an increase in mealie-meal and bread flour prices with immediate effect. GMAZ chairman Mr Tafadzwa Musarara said the increase has been necessitated by a rise in the prices of maize and wheat by the Grain Marketing Board (GMB).  The cost of maize rose from ZW$43 000 a tonne to ZW$50 000 while bread flour increased by 14,74 percent from ZW119 000 a tonne to ZW$136,544. Mr Musarara said the country will need to import 155 000 tonnes of wheat to cover the local production deficit. He said the Ukraine-Russia war had resulted in an increase in prices of wheat as Zimbabwe imports most of its wheat from Russia. Retail price of a 10kg packet of roller meal will increase by 15 percent from ZW$955 to ZW$1 099 and bakers are likely to increase the price of bread following the increase in the price of flour.
