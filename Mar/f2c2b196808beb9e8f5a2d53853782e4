The Chronicle Wedding of Rodney Moyo, the last born son of Fanuel Moyo and Cestina Moyo of Filabusi and Sisanda Ncube, the last born daughter of John Wesley Ncube and Ethel Ncube of Gwanda.  Tied the knot on . . . February 21, 2022. We chose . . . Churchill Events in Bulawayo for our wedding ceremony and reception because of its beautiful scenic views. How did you meet? We first met at Mpopoma SDA Church in 2015, but started dating in November 2016. We had our ‘mini’/’private’ engagement on the 2nd of July, 2021 on Sisanda’s birthday after being in courtship for five years. This was then followed by the lobola ceremony and official engagement on the 21st of November 2021. Did you face any challenges preparing for the wedding? The major challenge we faced was coming up with the guest list because our numbers were limited due to Covid-19 restrictions yet both of our families are big, not mentioning friends, colleagues and church members. Wedding colours . . . Navy blue and champagne gold. Wedding dress . . . was a princess wedding gown that was provided by Blush Boutique. The bridal team . . . was a team of three bridesmaids and three groomsmen; Carol Nomagugu Sayi being the best lady and Trust Takavapa being the best man plus one mini bride. The cake . . . was a five-tier cake with a three-tier vegan cake and two-tier fruit cake. My favourite part of the wedding . . . was when the bride was handed over to me by her father. The most touching moment . . . was when we exchanged our vows. The most touching speech . . . was when he promised to love and support me in front of my parents. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595937" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> What was on the menu?
