THE Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) will hold its annual general meeting on February 12 where plans to resume local action will be laid out. BVA has not held any competitions since 2019 and is hoping for a full return to activities. “We are set to have our AGM next week and the meeting will give us a clear picture of where we are headed as an association. The focus of the AGM is to help us get back into action. We are also going to be looking at the calendar of events, which are activities that are supposed to happen and who is supposed to do what. “We are also going to be pegging affiliation fees for teams that wish to be part of the league. We have had national events but now we want to start local programmes and there will be a lot of activities, especially in beach volleyball,” said BVA chairperson William Mazviro. During the Covid-19 enforced break, BVA came up with var­i­ous projects meant to de­velop and improve the stan­dards of the game in the city.  BVA has also en­listed var­i­ous com­mit­tees into its struc­tures in a bid to make its brand more marketable and reach out to stake­hold­ers more ef­fec­tively. These are the ref­erees’ com­mis­sion, players commis­sion, mar­ket­ing com­mis­sion, gen­der com­mis­sion and the coaches and corporate commis­sions. Meanwhile, The Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) is reviving the Youth Sports Exchange Programme through partnership with the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee (NIF). The exchange programme is a partnership which involves four countries, Malawi, Norway, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Some members of the ZVA executive board are currently attending a workshop in Zambia under the programme. – @innocentskizoe
