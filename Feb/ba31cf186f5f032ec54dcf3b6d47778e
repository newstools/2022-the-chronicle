Young Stunna, Nutty O and DJ Zandimaz were the headline acts at the ‘We Move Fest’ held at BAC Leisure Centre on Sunday where artistes from Bulawayo also came to the party. It was the first time that South African Young Stunna of the Adiwele fame was performing in Zimbabwe and it was befitting that his debut performance was in Bulawayo, the hub of entertainment. <img class="size-full wp-image-591818" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/DJ-Zandimaz-at-the-We-Move-Fest.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/DJ-Zandimaz-at-the-We-Move-Fest.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/DJ-Zandimaz-at-the-We-Move-Fest-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Zandimaz at the We Move Fest Hip-hop artiste POY, dancers Megatronz, amapiano crooner MJ Sings and entertainer Xavier, all the way from the United Kingdom, kept the crowd on their feet the whole night. The fusion of music was a perfect balance and it seems every genre can blend into amapiano, which has become a universal sound that many people around the world are getting to grips with. Many artistes have since jumped onto the amapiano train such as Davido who is a hip-hop/Naija artiste, Cassper Nyovest, Costa Tich and even Young Stunna who started off as a hip hop artiste, but switched to amapiano in a move that has given him so much fame. South Africa-based DJ Zandimaz and Nutty O were fresh from winning big at the Zimbabwe Music Awards (Zima) where they both walked away with three gongs. People could not get enough of Nutty O as he brought some dancehall flavour. Many fans were waiting for him to perform the hit song, Handipere Power that led him to his victory at the Zimas. When he is on stage, he looks like the cool kid that people want to be associated with. His slick moves certainly had the crowd eating of his hand.  DJ Zandimaz, in an immaculate pink outfit, was on the decks and moved the crowd as she played hits such as Ngifuna Wena, Umgqibelo and Emathandweni. She was part DJ and part performer on stage with the crowd dancing and singing along to most of the songs. When Young Stunna got onto the stage, the place went into delirium as the mood went up a notch. Clad in all white, Young Stunna was greeted by wild cheers. Although he is commonly known for his hit song Adiwele, Young Stunna went through his hits such as Baxolele and Sithi Shwi.
The event that was well-attended by people from different parts of the country, also served as a birthday celebration for Rethusaneng “Ree” Mabuka who is the proprietor of BAC Leisure. You had to be there to witness how much people were enjoying themselves and it seems that amapiano is here to stay. However, those who missed the show on Sunday have a chance to make up this weekend as more South African artistes, Cassper Nyovest, Naak Musiq and Amaroto (Zuma and Reece Madlisa) will be coming down to the city. The show will be held at Khumalo Hockey Stadium this coming Sunday.
