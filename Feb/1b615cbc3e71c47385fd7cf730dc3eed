The Chronicle Matthew 5 vs 13 – 14 “You are the salt of the earth . . .You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill that cannot be hidden.” When the bible speaks about being the salt of the earth we sometimes do not understand what it really means. When you apply a little bit of salt to food that is being prepared, it automatically changes the flavour of the food for the better, from just being an ordinary dish to becoming extraordinary if prepared by the right hands. Therefore in the same way that flavouring plays a major part in changing the composition of a dish, our Christian walk should be the same. When a person who knows the Lord and is led by the Spirit walks into a room, the complexion of the room changes and you can feel the weight of the faith that the person carries.  Our Christian walk should change our characters and enable us to get to a point where when we become a part of a group or gathering, our faith and our knowledge changes the complexion of the room. What are you known for as a Christian? I know a few people who are truly the salt of the earth within the Christian settings; prayer warriors, people of faith who can change events and circumstances all because of their faith. We are called to be those people who have become so confident in the Lord through their experience and knowledge that their faith speaks more than anything else they may say. Each one of us has the ability to grow our faith and experience with the Lord, it all depends on the investment we make in God and His ways. May the Lord grant us the ability to grow in our faith to a point where we truly become the salt of the earth, the flavouring that positively speaks of the Lord and His ways and allows us to fulfil the mandate we have been given to spread His word to the ends of the earth. May God give us the strength and the capability to do so. Be blessed
