The Chronicle PIERRE-Emerick Aubameyang will have a medical at Barcelona after the club agreed a free-transfer signing from Arsenal.
The 32-year-old Gabon striker has not played for the Gunners since a disciplinary breach in December. He has scored 92 goals in 163 games since a £56m arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2018. Barcelona feared the move was dead earlier on transfer deadline day even though Aubameyang had flown to Spain. He had also been linked with a switch to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr. If he departs, it will leave Gunners boss Mikel Arteta with just Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah as his forwards for the remainder of the season. Aubameyang was sent home early from the Africa Cup of Nations in January because of ongoing health issues. The striker missed Gabon’s draw with Ghana after scans revealed “heart lesions” following a bout of Covid, although later scans gave him the all-clear. – BBC Sport
