THERE is a need for awareness and enforcement of environment laws to curb littering by residents to keep Bulawayo clean. This was said by Bulawayo Secretary for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Mr Paul Nyoni during the monthly clean-up campaign yesterday. <img class="wp-image-589450 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Clean-up-campaign-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Clean-up-campaign-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Clean-up-campaign-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Part of the waste removed from the environment at Mahamba Business Centre in Inyathi The main provincial site of the clean-up campaign was Centenary Park in Bulawayo and Government officials, members of the Bulawayo City Council, officials from the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), Miss Environment Zimbabwe Miss Jemima Mandemwa, staff from Holiday Inn and other members of the public took part. In December 2018, President Mnangagwa declared the first Friday of each month as the National Environment Cleaning Day when all citizens are supposed to clean their surroundings between 8AM and 10AM. <img class="wp-image-589452 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Kwekwe-Clean-Up-Campaign.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Kwekwe-Clean-Up-Campaign.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Kwekwe-Clean-Up-Campaign-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Kwekwe leg of the clean-up campaign Mr Nyoni, who was the guest of honour during the clean-up campaign said more needs to be done to enforce laws that discourage littering. “It takes time to sink in and we will continue with the message to say this is important. We have discussed with relevant authorities issues of enforcement. Some of our problems are to do with lax enforcement. For example, when one drives into South Africa you observe the rules on littering. But you cross into Zimbabwe, people stop. So, the difference is enforcement,” said Mr Nyoni. He said littering causes blockages in drains as evidenced by the flooded streets during the rainy season. “There was a storm yesterday (Thursday) in Bulawayo and a lot of roads were flooded. Part of the reason is this littering, where people block their own drainages, even if the city council unblocks it, it’s a continuous circle. People continue to litter; roads are flooded and we are saying to the public this is not what we need. This is in a city where there is flooding in low lying areas and we are the last city where we should allow that kind of littering,” said Mr Nyoni.  An illegal rank along Leopold Takawira Avenue, just by Eveline High School and the Centenary Park, for buses and pirate taxis which ply Bulawayo-Beitbridge, Bulawayo-Gwanda, Bulawayo-Masvingo routes has been established. While some were cleaning up, a Chronicle news crew observed some passengers throwing litter out of bus windows, disregarding the efforts being made to clean the city and its environs. EMA Bulawayo provincial environmental manager Mrs Sithembisiwe Ndlovu hailed community health groups in the city for their efforts to keep the city clean. She challenged residents not to litter, adding that they must not be found on the wrong side of the law. “We want to change that culture of people throwing litter all over the place. Those who can provide bins and assist the local authority, so that there are bins on each corner can do so. Businesses are also encouraged to have bins in and around their stores so that their clients can throw away their litter,” said Mrs Ndlovu. Mrs Amanda Hadebe-Mathema, General Manager of Holiday Inn said it was important to look after areas where they operate as a business, hence they are participating in the clean-up. “We don’t want to be a business that does not look after the environment. So, we do it as part of our corporate social responsibility to look after the areas we operate from. The visitors who come to the hotel, they also want to come to the city as their business doesn’t end at the hotel. The overall impression that they get about the city can influence their next decision to stay or to come back,” said Mrs Hadebe-Mathema. Miss Mandemwa encouraged people to continue supporting the clean-up exercise. In Matabeleland South, the main clean up exercise was conducted at Silalatshani Business Centre in Insiza District. Villagers, workers from various Government departments and members of the uniformed forces took part in the clean-up exercise which started at 8AM and ended at 10AM. Community members from Khayelitsha Township in Colleen Bawn joined forces with council members, EMA representatives and workers from PPC Zimbabwe to clean-up the township. In Gwanda, the clean-up exercise was held in Spitzkop North extension starting from Njanji Business Centre.
Gwanda acting District Development Coordinator Mr Thulani Moyo encouraged the business community to purchase bins to ensure proper disposal of litter. “Each shop must have a bin so that litter is disposed of correctly. Let’s continue to keep our town clean,” said Mr Moyo.
In Matabeleland North, the clean-up exercise was hosted by Bubi District at Mahamba Business Centre. Bubi RDC and the District Coordinator’s Office mobilised and coordinated stakeholders at the centre to clean their immediate surroundings. The business community, transport operators, vendors, NGOs and various Government departments participated. The Provincial Environmental Manager, Mrs Chipo Mpofu Zuze reminded participants of the provisions of Section 70 and 83 of the Environmental Management Act Chapter 20:27 that prohibit the discharging of waste at undesignated sites and littering. She said it is encouraging to note that clean up campaigns are no longer being spearheaded by EMA but various stakeholders in the province are now conducting self-initiated clean ups. In the Midlands Province, corporates, Government departments and the community gathered at Amaveni Shopping Centre in Kwekwe where the provincial clean-up campaign was held. In his speech, Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Senator Larry Mavima discouraged people from dumping waste at undesignated sites. “Dumping of waste like used pampers is becoming a serious problem not only in Kwekwe but in the province as a whole. I challenge you all today to desist from the practice of waste everywhere. I have observed in most streets that everywhere in the province, there is that problem,” said Minister Mavima. He urged local authorities to establish waste management and recycling plants. “Kwekwe city is the first one to establish a recycling plant which will in the long run be producing energy. I encourage all local authorities in the province to start thinking towards establishing such centres which will be helpful in preserving energy. Government has since pledged total support for the city hence I urge all local authorities to take up the support from Government,” said Minister Mavima. Children, he said, should be taught to maintain a clean environment from a tender age. Minister Mavima who is also Zanu-PF provincial chair urged the electorate to vote for responsible candidates who help clean up the cities.
