Sungura muso Peter Moyo is set to drop a 10-track album that is laced with love tracks today. “On this album, I’ll be called DJ Mapepetso and not the usual stage name because the album is unique in that it’s not a sungura one, but contains various genres. These include conscious reggae, Afro-beat, contemporary and Zimdancehall,” Young Igwe said. “This is the first time I’ve done this and I hope that people will embrace DJ Mapepetso.” Produced by Oscar ‘Skiddomix’ Chamba, the album contains tracks including ‘Happy’, ‘Babie’, ‘Dairawo’, ‘Kumbira’, ‘Chiyedza’ and ‘Chichie’. He said trying out other genres was a way of showing his unique talent. “This is the other side of Peter Moyo. I did everything from vocals, but just using a different name and playing around with different beats.” The artiste who has also been dabbling in acting is showing people his diverse skills. This will be his sixth album ever since he took over Utakataka Express following  the death of his father, the late legendary Tongai Moyo.
