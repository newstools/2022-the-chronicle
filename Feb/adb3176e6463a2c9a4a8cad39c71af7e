The Madzimbahwe exhibition will run till 28 February 2022 during weekdays from 10am to 5pm, under the theme: Visualizing the ways of seeing, ways of doing and ways of being. In her welcome remarks, the Zimbabwe Pavilion Commissioner General, Ambassador Mary Mubi said, “The theme as you know for Expo 2020 Dubai is Connecting minds, Creating the future. “We felt that as we were coming to Expo one of the key mediums for connecting minds across the world is music and you saw that not just our exhibitors but we are joined by our nationals’ people who are living in Dubai. “Music connects us and it is a very important part of our culture and of our identity as a people.”  The exhibition themed ‘Madzimbahwe’ is free to the public and celebrates the cultural revolution of Zimbabwe’s creative sector as it further seeks to connect the minds in the spirit of Expo 2020 Dubai. The guest of honour, Zimbabwe Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Ambassador Lovemore Mazemo, said: “Zimbabwe is proud to be showcasing its artists in Dubai, more so on the sidelines of the world’s greatest showcase Expo 2020 Dubai. “Zimbabwe is amongst the over 192 official participants and has a dedicated country pavilion where we are unpacking our country’s abundant opportunities that are embodied in our natural resources, chief amongst them being the incredible human capital. Zimbabweans have remarkable creativity and the Zimbabwean story is incomplete if its narrative does not include the exceptional and authentic talent of its artists.” He highlighted that all efforts were centered on the realisation of Vision 2030 of attaining an upper middle income economy, further indicating that arts are a critical component of the journey. Ambassador Mazemo added: “An exhibition of selected Zimbabwean artists especially around this time of the Al Quoz festival is our way of giving the visitor a taste of the rich artistic talent that Zimbabwe holds. This exhibition’s diverse mix of artists; reflects the nation itself, which is rich in narratives from all parts of society. National identity ultimately forms the core of this show; our story is as fluid as a first generation, stone sculptor exhibited alongside a debutante young artist; the conversations between these two generations and all that stands between is powerful.” Zimbabwe Pavilion is exhibiting under the theme: ‘Zimbabwe The Land of Great Opportunities’ and the message to the global village is Go See, Go Trade and Go Invest, inspired by President Mnangagwa’s mantra: ‘Zimbabwe is Open for business’. The exhibition was put together by the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation together with the National Gallery of Zimbabwe with the support of the Zimbabwe Pavilion Commissioner General’s office. The artefacts by various artists were inspired by the women’s everyday activities, family obligations, economic aspirations, womanhood, traditions and spirituality, family structure amongst other issues. The featured artists include Danisile Ncube, Nothando Chiwanga, Tamary Kudita, Doris Kamupira, Admire Kamudzengerere, Issac Choloka amongst others. Zimbabwe Pavilion at the Expo 2020 Dubai is inspired by the Great Zimbabwe monument, in recognition of the historical journey of resilience, creativity and connecting minds that have characterised modern day Zimbabwe.
