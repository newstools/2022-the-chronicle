The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent THREE Kwekwe men lost their valuables after two men who had offered them a lift to Redcliff robbed them. The incident happened on Wednesday at around 10.30PM, when the three, Tatenda Ranganai (32), John Chandiwana (39) and Nkosilathi Khumalo (41) were given a lift to Redcliff. The robbers instead of driving to Redcliff diverted the route and parked the car in the bush where they robbed the trio of their belongings. Midlands provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said police have since launched a manhunt for the duo. “The trio boarded an unregistered silver Toyota Vitz in the Kwekwe central business district intending to go to Redcliff. The vehicle had two occupants including the driver,” said Inspector Mahoko. Along the way, the driver diverted the route and stopped at a secluded place.  Insp Mahoko said the suspects produced knives and threatened to stab the three while demanding cash and valuables. “Cash, cellphones and groceries were taken from the three before they were dumped and the suspects drove back to Kwekwe,” said Inspector Mahoko. In another incident, robbers broke into Sponono Bar in Mkoba suburb in Gweru recently and got away with cash,cellphones and beer. “The barlady, Olinda Gondogwe (26) and Epson Chirambamuriwo (35) who works as a security guard at the bar, retired to bed in separate rooms. At around 3AM, four unknown people broke into the premise and demanded cash from the two,” said Insp Mahoko. They ransacked the place and took US$138, cellphones and beer before locking the two in the bar and went away. Police are appealing to members of the public that might have information leading to the arrest of the suspects in the two cases to approach any nearest police station.
