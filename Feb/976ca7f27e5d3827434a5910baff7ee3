JUDO Association of Zimbabwe president Smart Deke is new president of the Southern Africa Judo Confederation. Deke was elected on Friday last week during the region’s congress held virtually. He takes over from Alfred Foloko from Zambia. He will be deputised by Nilton Mujovo of Mozambique. Ngun’i Mabvuto of Zambia is the secretary and Eswatini’s Kim Thobile comes in as treasurer. Osborne Banda from Malawi is the technical director. Deke said the new executive is going to work towards developing and growing the sport in the region.  “We are looking at the development of judo in the region as a whole and build up a strong team that will compete with the rest of Africa and the world. Our region is lagging behind in many sports due to lack of constant regional competition and strategic plan. We are going to focus on judo in the schools’ programme, cadets and youth in preparation for future major events,” said Deke. The new executive’s term of office is four years.
