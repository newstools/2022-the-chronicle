Mr Chiota said the mine’s journey on compliance to globally accepted ISO standards began 15 years ago. “We started with the implementation of the ISO 14001:2004 environmental management system, which was a commitment to the highest standards in managing and protecting our environment. “We also implemented the globally renowned behaviour-based safety programme as a result, we saw a massive drop in annual injury numbers by 60 percent,” he said. -@SikhulekelaniM1
