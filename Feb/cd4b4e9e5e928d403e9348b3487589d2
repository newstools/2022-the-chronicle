WOMEX 22 will be taking place in Portugal’s coastal capital city of Lisbon,” read a statement by organisers. “WOMEX explicitly welcomes proposals from all backgrounds and encourages submissions, especially those that increase the international music scene’s diversity – be it of culture, region, gender, styles, performance tradition, and more. Share and spread the word so that all artists, speakers, filmmakers and music professionals of the global music scene worldwide can apply to be a part of the WOMEX 22 Programme.” The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity described Womex as “The most important international professional market of world music of every kind. This international fair brings together professionals from the worlds of folk, roots, ethnic and traditional music and also includes concerts, conferences and documentary films. It contributes to networking as an effective means of promoting music and culture of all kinds across frontiers.’ – @eMKlass_49
