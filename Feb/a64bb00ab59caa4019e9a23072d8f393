THE Mighty Warriors have made three changes for the second-leg of the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations qualifier against Botswana in Francistown tomorrow. Coach Sithethelelwe Sibanda dropped Lindiwe Magwede, Shyline Dambamuromo and Ennert Chemhere, who were part of the squad that lost the first-leg 3-1 at the National Sports Stadium on Friday. They have been replaced by Precious Mudyiwa, Talent Mkwanda and Christabel Katona. The trio join veterans Rudo Neshamba, Danai Bhobho, Emmaculate Msipha and Rutendo Makore. National teams’ general manager Wellington Mpandare said the Mighty Warriors, who left Harare on a chartered flight yesterday, are geared up for the Botswana tie. “The team will sleep in Botswana. They’re travelling by a chartered flight. In terms of morale, it is high and the girls are geared up for the tie. They have been paid appearance fees for the first game, camping allowances for the duration of the camp and those travelling have received the allowance in foreign currency. What you must note is that these allowances have been paid at the same rates as the men’s senior national team,” said Mpandare. He hoped the Mighty Warriors will overturn the deficit in Botswana.  To qualify, the Mighty Warriors need to win by a 2-0 margin. In the first-leg, defensive lapses saw them gifting Botswana soft goals. They were exposed for lack of game time as most of the players have gone for two years without playing competitive football. Women’s football failed to kick off last season despite being beneficiaries of a US$500 000 Covid-19 relief fund from Fifa. Mighty Warriors squad
