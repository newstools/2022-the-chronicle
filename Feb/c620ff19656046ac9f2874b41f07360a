HIGHLANDERS coach Mandla Mpofu believes it’s only a matter of time before his strikers finally start to score after watching his charges missing a glut of clear-cut chances against Whawha. Bosso registered their first victory of the season when they beat Whawha 2-0 in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League at Barbourfields Stadium, with both goals coming from well-struck free kicks by defensive midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku. Highlanders enjoyed dominance in the first-half but failed to turn it into goals. They created real scoring opportunities in the second-half which they blew away. Mpofu gave January signings, striker Stanley Ngala and Rahman Kutsanzira starts and they exerted themselves well. However, Ngala twice fluffed scoring opportunities after finding himself face-to-face with Whawha goalie Alexander Useni. The arrival of Ngala was expected to address Bosso’s impotence in front of goal but the striker proved rather wasteful on Sunday. <img class="size-full wp-image-550125" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mandla-Mpofu-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mandla-Mpofu-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mandla-Mpofu-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu Ngala, who was signed from FC Platinum, had a telepathic understanding with Ray Lunga, who was unfortunate to be substituted midway through the first-half after picking an ankle injury. Lynoth Chikuhwa replaced Lunga on the right wing, but it was deep in the second-half that his only contribution came when he moved into the centre to connect a cross from Andrew Mbeba which cannoned off the woodwork. “Obviously you get worried when your strikers miss clear-cut chances, but in the same breath, I believe there are positives in the sense that we’re getting into scoring positions. It’s only a matter of time before we start scoring.  Remember we only trained for five weeks and as such getting into those scoring areas is a great improvement,” said Mpofu. Washington Navaya and Chikuhwa’s conversion rate is worrying as the former has scored just a single goal in Highlanders’ seven games in the Chibuku Super Cup from the group stages to the quarter-finals while Chikuhwa has only found the net twice. They are yet to score in the four Premiership outings. — @ZililoR
