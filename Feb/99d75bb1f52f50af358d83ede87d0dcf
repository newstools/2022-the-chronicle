The Chronicle John 15:18: “If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. (NKJV) Being different as a young believer is not always easy because many young people want to jump on the bandwagon and follow the crowd in many different ways. Nonetheless, being a follower of Jesus Christ has never been about following anyone else but Him. You are called to be different! When you are young, the Bible says you must remember your Creator in the days of your youth before difficult days come. These are two principles I want to talk about, the principle of small beginnings and the principle of remembering your Creator before difficult days come.  If today as a youth you are not on fire for Jesus, you are in for a treat in the future. You must be on fire now because when you get married, become a bread winner, start a job, a business or family, you enter a difficult and challenging zone that can only be sustained by a strong foundation in your character and will. The adult zone is a higher dimension, one that has an array of responsibilities and expectations from your Pastor, your spouse, family, boss or employees. Here, you have to know how to deal with all without neglecting the other, all without running out of ideas. This is when this scripture comes into play: Ecclesiastes 12:1: “Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, “I find no pleasure in them”—NIV All these things can be overwhelming and can create stress and pressure and if you have no Word of God or solid relationship with God you can backslide and lose it all to bankruptcy, divorce, sickness, and economic challenges among others. So this time when you are being spoon-fed with spiritual information is very important.
