ZIMBABWE Women Soccer League chairperson Barbara Chikosi has distanced herself from a supposed Zifa executive committee decision to suspend acting chief executive officer and spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela as well as national teams’ general manager Wellington Mpandare. Gwesela and Mpandare were among a long list of administrators “suspended” by the “executive committee” over a number of allegations. In a statement yesterday, Chikosi, who is among the suspended Zifa executive committee members, said she was not part of that decision and all other “resolutions” made by Zifa president Felton Kamambo, Philimon Machana and Bryton Malandule since the Sports and Recreation Commission suspended the national association’s board on November 16 last year. “I have noted with great concern that three of my colleagues in the suspended Zifa executive committee, namely Felton Kamambo, Phillemon Machana and Bryton Malandule have purportedly suspended Zifa employees and officials at a meeting held on the 29th of January 2022. I would like to confirm that despite being an executive committee member, I was not invited to this meeting and the meeting was not held as per the dictates of our constitution, which require a 14-day notice. “The suspensions are therefore null and void. I also would like to distance myself from all the meetings that are said to have taken place after our suspension by the SRC on the 16th of November 2021. I would like to urge my colleagues in the suspended Zifa board to behave in a professional way and not these tendencies of dividing the football family,” wrote Chikosi. She becomes the second member to distance herself from the “resolutions” after Premier Soccer League boss Farai Jere, whose audio to his colleagues leaked this week.
