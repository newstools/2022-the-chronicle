Happy birthday to you and may God bless you with many years. Cheers to more music loading. I wish you nothing but the best,” she wrote. The Jerusalema and Ghanama hit-makers rekindled their love after they announced the end of their long-term relationship in 2020 to focus on their budding careers.  “Me and Makhadzi parted ways months ago to focus on our careers. We are still young and we need to achieve big things. (We) hope everyone understands and respects that. I am no longer going to answer anything related to this. Thanks,” Master KG wrote on Facebook. “It is true. It has come to an end of our relationship. Kindly respect our decision,” Makhadzi wrote on her timeline to confirm the news at the time. – TimesLive
