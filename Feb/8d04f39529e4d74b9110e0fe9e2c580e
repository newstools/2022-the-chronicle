The Chronicle The Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix has been cancelled as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. An F1 statement said it had been agreed at a meeting of stakeholders “that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances”. It added that F1 was watching the ongoing situation in Ukraine “with sadness and shock and hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution”. The Russian Grand Prix was due to take place on 25 September in Sochi. Meanwhile, Haas team boss Gunther Steiner has said the future of his driver Nikita Mazepin “needs to resolved”. Steiner said the team had “legal issues to go through” in an apparent hint the US-based outfit are trying to split from Mazepin and the sponsorship money that comes from his father Dmitry — a billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Haas had already removed the logos advertising Mazepin’s company before Friday’s final day of this week’s pre-season test in Barcelona. Steiner said the team would work on the situation next week, but insisted the future of Haas in F1 was not in doubt. The Russian Grand Prix is closely associated with Putin, who was instrumental in it being established in 2014 in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi, where he has a palace. The event is due to move to a purpose-built facility outside St Petersburg, Putin’s hometown, from 2023, but the event’s future in F1 must now be in serious doubt. On Thursday, four-time champion Sebastian Vettel said he would not race in Russia if the race went ahead. The German said: “I should not go, I will not go. It is wrong to race in the country. “I am sorry for the innocent people who are being killed for stupid reasons and a very strange and mad leadership.” His thoughts were echoed by world champion Max Verstappen, who said: “When a country is at war it is not right to race there.” — BBC Sport
