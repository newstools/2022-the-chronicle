High-riding Tsholotsho outfit Insimbi ZeZhwane are in high spirits after bagging their first gong at the Zimbabwe Music Awards. That duo of Elvis “MaEli” Mathe and Meluleki “Brema” Moyo that is known for hits Imbemba, iGinyambila and Impande yeMinyela was awarded the Best Tshibilika group at the ceremony that was held in Harare on Saturday.  Last year, the outfit scooped a Roil Bulawayo Arts Award in the same category showing that they are definitely doing something right. The group’s bassist Brema expressed the group’s happiness. “We’re over the moon as this latest honour shows that what we’re doing is being noticed far and wide.” Brema said this win has spurred the group to work harder. He said they are working on a new album that they hope to release this year. Following their success in terms of awards, Brema said their hope is to one day perform at national events so that everyone can be able to witness them live in action. “We’ll continue working hard to give our fans music, quality music. Our greatest wish is to be invited to perform on a national platform where we’ll be able to showcase our talent because we’re also advocating for unity in our country,” said Brema. Insimbi ZeZhwane is a joint venture between Brema and MaEli who is the lead vocalist and lead guitar player. Brema said the band has been in the music business for years although they started making waves after recording their last two productions. “When we started, we were five, but other members left due to various reasons leaving the two of us. We started recording in 2015 as we had tried to before that and failed. But now, we’re receiving a lot of support from fans. “We love what we do and I know that we’re here to stay as our music is loved by many,” he said.
