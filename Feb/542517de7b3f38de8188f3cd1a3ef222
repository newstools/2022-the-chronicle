A Bulilima District centenarian man who gained international sympathy when his homestead was torched by his granddaughter’s boyfriend early last year has died. Lewis Phiri died at his homestead in Tjinjika village in the early hours of Sunday morning at the age 109 following a short illness. Family spokesperson Miss Sibongile Zimande confirmed his death.  “Our Father has died after a short illness.He started complaining of not feeling well on Friday and we took him to Ndiweni Clinic on Saturday and he was attended to and we went back with him home but he did not improve and passed away at home,” she said. The centenarian was buried at his homestead yesterday. Miss Zimande said the family will forever remain grateful for the support they got when they lost everything in the fire. Mr Phiri’s story touched many people which saw an outpouring of support from Zimbabweans both at home and abroad in an initiative coordinated by the Chronicle resulting in a two bedroomed house being built by well wishers. Various individuals who include community members, organisations and churches donated to his cause and some companies which extended a helping hand include PPC which donated cement. Former Highlanders coach Cosmos Tsano Zulu donated a suit and some money after the centenarian complained that the fire had destroyed the suit he wanted to be buried in. A Zimbabwean based in Canada, Mr Tichaona Maphosa supported the family with US$50 every month for a year. The assailant, Felix Moyo was later arrested in Tsholotsho and imprisoned for the crime.
