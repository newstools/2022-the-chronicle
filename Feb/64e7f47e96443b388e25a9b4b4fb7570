The Chronicle Business Reporter WITH only a month away from the April phase one deadline, Egodini Mall contractor, Terracotta Trading (Private) Limited, is continuing with construction work, now focused on taxi rank and bus roads, and bays for informal traders. In the above video shared by the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) today, “construction of taxi rank roads, Zupco rank roads and informal trader’s final platform levels are ongoing at the eGodini Mall in preparation for laying of road curbs, asphalt and pavers soon”.
