AFTER the cancellation of last year’s event, organisers of the Mapopoma Festival are preparing to host an Easter edition. The organisers, known for combining stellar acts from around the country for an end-of-year party in Victoria Falls, are set to host the Easter edition as a way to make it up to their followers. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that continues to disrupt events, the event was cancelled last year after having been trimmed from three days to one. The festival’s founder, Patrick Musonza, said they have signed contracts with a number of acts, but are taking baby steps in organising the Easter edition. “Since we postponed our usual event in December last year, April 26 has been set as the new date where we’ll host our Easter edition. Feli Nandi and Mzoe 7 are the acts that we’ve confirmed so far and we’re in the process of engaging other artistes locally and abroad to make the event a trademark on its own,” said Musonza. He said although they have released a date for the event, they are still deliberating on whether to make it a one-day event or increase the number of days. “We’re still debating on whether the event will be a one-day show or it’ll run throughout the Easter period as we intend to do something that’s never been done before. This is from the venue to theme, it’ll be a whole new concept,” said Musonza. It seems the resort city will be a hive of activity this Easter as the annual Victoria Falls Carnival that was also postponed last year is set to take place during the Easter holidays. – @mthabisi_mthire
