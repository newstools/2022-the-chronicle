THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) has announced the return of the Nedbank Rugby Challenge Cup, which gets underway in Harare over the weekend. The competition returns after a three-year hiatus and is being held this year in partnership with Harare Province Rugby and the Sables Trust. Six teams will play three rounds of matches, with the top two teams playing in the final on March 12. The games will also be used to choose the Goshawks Select side that will participate in the Currie Cup in March 2022. All local players have an opportunity to impress the Sables head coach and selectors.  The Nedbank Rugby Challenge Cup will be contested by Old Georgians, Old Hararians Rugby, Harare Sports Club Rugby, Southern City, Manicaland Select and Bulawayo Select. “Due to the interest from other teams, we will look to rotate the worst performing team for the next round of fixtures to ensure all players get an opportunity. The first two rounds will be hosted by Old Georgians, with round three and the final to be confirmed in due course,” ZRU said. Nedbank last year took a giant step in helping Sables’ coach Brendan Dawson and ZRU president Aaron Jani achieve their dream when the bank injected US$120 000 into the Sables’ 2023 World Cup qualifying campaign. Zimbabwe will join seven other countries in France for the 2023 World Cup qualifiers in July this year. The countries are Zimbabwe, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Namibia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Uganda and Senegal. – @innocentskizoe
