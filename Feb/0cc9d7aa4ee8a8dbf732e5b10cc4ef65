The Chronicle Stephen Mpofu, Perspective
Whoever originated and / or popularised the wise saying above must have been possessed by a spirit that discerned future happenings in our motherland and elsewhere in the world with the voice of that spirit inspiring the gallant sons and daughters of the armed revolution in our motherland, as elsewhere, to march ever forward, and never retreat, something that resulted in the migration of our people from a racist colonial Rhodesia now a ghost country. As such, who on this earth should want to move backwards and to a country where spooks now reign, instead of continuing to move forward, that is, developing and taking Zimbabwe and all of its inhabitants into a brave new future in post-modernity, so that others in the global village who suffer want politically, economically and socially to be spurred by our successes for them to emulate us and in the process prevent political conflicts? The moral of the discourse above is that Zimbabweans at every level of our society should work indefatigably, driven by an unflinching intrepidity, to take the revolution that freed us from racist oppression in all aspects ever forward as the saying in the headline above urges us, and not retrograde under the spell of political violence such as that witnessed in one suburb in Bulawayo by thugs throwing stones and using catapults at campaigning members of the ruling party ahead of by-elections on March 26 to fill vacant parliamentary and local government seats in various parts of the country. What the violence, any political violence wherever it occurs, implies is that the hooligans do not mind if their candidate is fielded in the constituency in question against a more competent candidate from another party so long as their own party candidate is given a chance to romp to victory whether or not that person will take the constituency backward rather than forward as the indefatigable voice of the spirit of the revolution says. With general elections due next year it becomes paramount in accordance with the exhortation in the headline above that only those candidates possessing the wherewithal to move Zimbabwe ever forward rather than let it stagnate, or remain backward, should be given the nod by voters to fill vacant council as well as parliamentary seats and for some government posts so that the country moves ever forward. Concomitant with the above thefts or vandalism of electrical copper wires thereby inconveniencing consumers of electrical power through blackouts, as well as thefts or sabotage of digital appliances are the things retrogressive to a country moving forward developmentally rather than stagnating or moving backwards when other states are advancing development wise. The unlawful acts by our people in their own country are wont to negatively impact friendly foreign countries eager to invest their hard earned capital in Zimbabwe to take the country further ahead developmentally. For instance, as reported in this newspaper two days ago, some European Union members such as The Netherlands, want to partner Zimbabwe in various areas that will help grow the economy, according to Mr Mark Aglerdenbosch, the Chief Executive Officer of Southern Africa / Netherlands Chamber of Commerce, after a meeting with President Mnangagwa, in Brussels for the African Union / European Union Summit. He said: “We also discussed opportunities in ICT working with universities, setting up collaborations between Dutch universities and universities in Zimbabwe.” [That the EU country’s enchantment with Zimbabwe comes after Britain, this country’s former colonial power walked out of that economic bloc is another story for a lean day, news wise.] The Second Republic government’s policy that Zimbabwe is open for business is therefore intended to move the country ever forward in development terms and not let the motherland stagnate or remain backward. The above therefore calls for unmitigated patriotism on the part of every Zimbabwean so that imperialists who want this country and its people to suffer, witness illegal sanctions imposed on the Zanu-PF government as punishment for democratising land ownership at independence, and their local stooges will labour in vain trying to reverse the revolution that freed all of us from the knuckles of “those without knees” as our forefathers described the foreign racists who once ruled us upon their arrival in our country. Therefore, in the same way that this pen exhorts voters to never overload and strain the backs of councils, Parliament and of Government with easily disposable human cargo, Africans in power now and in the future should not allow themselves to be swayed in their work by so called “wiser advice” from so-called Big Brother democratic governments that condescendingly regard Third World governments as mere “make-believe” administrations and nothing better. Therefore, the message for all Zimbabweans and our compatriots on the African continent is: “forward ever, ever; backwards never, never ever again.”
