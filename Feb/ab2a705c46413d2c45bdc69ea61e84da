UMAHLEKISA Comedy club is set to host an open mic show that will fuse comedy, poetry, music and dance among other art activities as a way of promoting up-and-coming artistes. The show, set for 26 February at the Bulawayo Art Gallery, is going to feature performances by comedians Zwe Hlabangana and Frank Chirisa. This will be the club’s first show of the year after a series of online shows that were influenced by the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic. Umahlekisa director Ntando Van Moyo said the show will be an opportunity for people to interact with local artistes in a move aimed at improving turnout for public shows.  “It’s an opportunity for people to get to know their artists and be exposed to their work so that when an individual artist decides to host a show, people can turn up in their numbers. We’ve heard some saying they cannot pay a certain amount of money for an artist that they don’t know so this will help art lovers to familiarise themselves with local works,” Moyo said. He said to entice people, show attendees will pay whatever amount they want for admission as they want to give as many art lovers an opportunity to attend a show without having to worry about the ticket pricing. “People always complain that tickets are expensive so by saying they should pay what they want, we’re saying there’s no minimum or maximum fee. With any amount, people can come and enjoy performances,” he said.
