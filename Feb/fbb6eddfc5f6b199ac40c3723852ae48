ZANU-PF Matabeleland South Provincial Youth League chairperson Cde Moses Langa has urged ruling party youths to consider undergoing orientation at the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology. The school inculcates a sense of patriotism and produces disciplined individuals who have an appreciation of the party’s historical trajectory. In an interview, Cde Langa said: “Orientation through Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology is of paramount importance so that youths have an understanding of the history of our country and the party which will ensure that we are on the same page with the whole executive. Respect of our leadership will also make us to be able to safeguard the fight for our freedom.” He said his executive will tour all the seven districts in the province to strengthen and grow party structures. “What is important is visibility and visiting the youths in their respective districts and not only to see them, but also to know the problems they are facing as young as they are. We also need to know the numbers currently in the structures of the party as some might be just numbers, but without people in those positions,” said Cde Langa. He said as a province they will ensure youths are empowered and also get equal opportunities. The provincial youth leader said this can be in form of job opportunities within the province. Last Thursday, Cde Langa facilitated the distribution of the Presidential Inputs in UMzingwane district where 80 youths got fertiliser,  seed maize and chemicals. “This is a programme that is being rolled out in each and every district in Matabeleland South province and we are trying to have youths involved in it full time. We thank the President Dr Emmerson Mnangagwa for getting us involved in uplifting the country’s economy,” said Cde Langa.
