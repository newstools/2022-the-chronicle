ZIMBABWE national cricket team fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani is set to know his Indian Premier League (IPL) fate when the league’s auction kicks off in Bengaluru today. The 2022 IPL player auction which runs till tomorrow will see a total of 590 players around the world hoping to be signed up by one of the 10 franchises. Over 1 000 players had registered to be part of the IPL mega auction but only 590 were chosen including Muzarabani.  He will be hoping to become the fourth player from Zimbabwe to ever play in the IPL after Tatenda Taibu, Ray Price and the now disgraced Brendan Taylor. Muzarabani is presently playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) where he has played two games this far. The fast bowler helped the Multan Sultans to their sixth straight victory in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) after grabbing three wickets in his side’s 42-run win over Peshawar Zalmi on Thursday. Peshawar were bowled out for 140, after the Sultans had posted a strong total of 182. Muzarabani grabbed three wickets for 18, which were the best figures for his side, ahead of Khushdil Shah’s three for 26. Muzarabani removed Kamran Akmal and Haider Ali with the second ball and sixth ball of his opening over. The other wicket was that of Sherfane Rutherford. Shan Masood was named player of the match for his 68 for Sultans. The victory meant the defending champions have now sealed a playoff spot. They’ve stretched their lead over second-placed Islamabad United by six points. -@innocentskizoe
