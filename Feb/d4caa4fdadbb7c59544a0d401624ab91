ONE of the country’s leading hotels, Kingdom Hotel in Victoria Falls on Monday helped couples spice up their Valentine’s Day celebrations with a discounted four-course sumptuous dinner  coupled with loads of entertainment. More than a dozen couples enjoyed the Valentine’s Day dinner that was dubbed African Royal. Entertainment was characterised by love songs, romantic sonnets from award-winning poet Obert Dube, comedy from Andrew Nyasha Manyika and drama from a local group called Valentines Skit. Kingdom Hotel general manager Nkosi Moyo said the gesture was meant to celebrate love with the community. “Our idea was to celebrate love with couples. This has become an annual event and the response was fairly good as couples showed how they can sacrifice for their loved ones,” said Moyo.  All couples were local residents. Upon arrival at the hotel, couples went through a photo booth where they posed for pictures for memories, in the meantime with the background romantic music. The dinner was held at White Water restaurant. It was a night of love, drama, laughter and good music. The directors of ceremonies Phineas Phiri, Dube and Manyika kept the event alive while DJ Hluz was at his best with a well-selected playlist. Simunye Arts also capped the night with traditional dance and music.
