EXPERIENCED tax expert Ms Regina Chinamasa has been appointed as the Acting Commissioner General for the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) with effect from today. This follows the early retirement of Acting Commissioner General, Mr Rameck Masaire. In a statement yesterday, Zimra vice board chair Mrs Josephine Matambo said Ms Chinamasa will be the acting Commissioner General effective today (February 1) as the tax collector is in the process of searching for a substantive candidate. “The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority board wishes to inform stakeholders and the public of the appointment of Ms Regina Chinamasa as the Acting Commissioner General of the authority with effect from 1 February 2022, while the board is processing the recruitment of the substantive Commissioner General,” she said. “Commissioner Chinamasa takes over from Mr Masaire who is retiring from the Authority effective 31 January 2022.” Ms Chinamasa is a tax expert with over 28 years of diverse experience in the field of revenue mobilisation and enforcement of compliance to fiscal laws. “Ms Chinamasa started her career as a tax assessor in 1994 in the then Department of Taxes and joined the Investigation Division of Zimra at its inception in 2001. “She moved to Customs and Excise in 2011 as head of compliance and risk management. “She was part of the team that introduced the authorised economic operators (AEOs) trade facilitation, post clearance audits among other innovations,” said Mrs Matambo. Zimra has been operating without a substantive Commissioner General after the departure of Ms Faith Mazani in January last year who left the organisation to join the International Monetary Fund. – @KazungaOliver
