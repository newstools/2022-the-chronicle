The Chronicle JOSE MOURINHO has been slapped with a two-game ban after incredibly accusing a referee of being a Juventus spy. The Portuguese manager was shown a red card in the 2-2 draw with Verona on Saturday. Mourinho made a gesture towards the referee on Saturday and then booted a ball away. Italian daily newspaper La Stampa reported that Mourinho shouted at official Luca Pairetto: “They sent you here on purpose, Juventus sent you.” He was given his marching orders in added-time of the Serie A clash.
After the match, Mourinho wrote on Instagram: “I love these people and for them I fight.”  The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said Mourinho “made serious allegations” against the referee, and entered the pitch “with a threatening attitude, blatantly disputing the refereeing decision”. The Portuguese coach, who left the stadium without stopping for post-match media duties, was also fined £16  700.
Mourinho was sent off in a game against Napoli earlier this season, receiving two yellow cards for dissent. He even received a red card in a pre-season match against Real Betis last summer, invading the pitch in protest to a goal before squaring up to the referee.  — Daily Mail
