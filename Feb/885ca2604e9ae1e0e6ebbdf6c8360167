The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A Kwekwe motorist was robbed of his car by a man he had offered a lift to Mbizo. Peter Mugodhi lost his Honda Fit to a man he had picked up at a garage where he taken his car for repairs. “Mugodhi was at a garage along 5 Avenue in Kwekwe when he was referred to Mbizo 19 to buy spare parts from another person who was breaking the same car. Another man who was also at the garage, then asked for a lift as he also needed some spares,” said Midlands Police Spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko. Along the way, Mugodhi picked a woman who was also going to Mbizo. The woman, according to police, asked to be dropped off when she had reached her destination. “Mugodhi then disembarked as he was assisting the woman to get out of the car. He left the engine running and the man he had given the lift jumped to the driver’s seat and sped off leaving the two stranded,” said Inspector Mahoko. Police have since launched a manhunt for the man and advised motorists to avoid offering unknown people lifts. “We reiterate the need for motorists to resist of giving people they do not know lifts. Cases of robbers masquerading as passengers are on the increase,” said Inspector Mahoko.
