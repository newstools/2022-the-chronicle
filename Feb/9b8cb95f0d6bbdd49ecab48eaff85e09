LADY Cheetahs coach Dereck Chiwara says they are trying to get as much game time as possible in their preparations for the Rugby Africa Cup finals to be held in Tunisia in April. The national sevens’ women’s rugby team played against South African development side SA Blues in a tournament which featured eight other academy sides in Cape Town at the weekend. “We took part in the Cape Town sevens tournament and the teams were placed into two pools. We won three games in our pool, finished second in the pool and third overall,” said Chiwara. He said it was a brilliant performance from the girls and he used the competition to give the girls game time, which is crucial. “It also gave us a chance to look at some of the fringe players in the squad and see where we need to improve. The competition was quite an eye opener for us,” said Chiwara. He said he was trying to get as much game time for the girls as they prepare for the Rugby Africa Cup. “For us it was not about the result but all about getting game time for our players,” said Chiwara.  The Lady Cheetahs will face the likes of Kenya, Madagascar, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Ghana and Uganda at the Rugby Africa tournament. The African qualifiers are for the Rugby World Cup Sevens that will be staged in Cape Town in September as well as the Commonwealth Games. The Lady Cheetahs are ranked fourth in Africa.
