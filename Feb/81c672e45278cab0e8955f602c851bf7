The Chronicle Senegal declared Monday a national holiday to celebrate winning its first ever Africa Cup of Nations. Celebrations erupted in the capital, Dakar, after Liverpool’s Sadio Mane sealed victory over Egypt on penalties. “When the win came, it was just indescribable. People just jumping on their feet, crying, hugging each other,” a BBC reporter in Dakar said. A triumphal reception was expected when the victorious team returns home from Cameroon later on Monday. Tens of thousands of people have gathered near the airport to welcome them. The celebrations began straight after the final whistle on Sunday night, with people going onto the streets of Dakar, dancing and firing fireworks into the air. The BBC’s Emeline Nsingi Nkosi in the city said people were sitting on top of their cars, waving flags in the national colours of red, gold and green. “It’s a street party.  I don’t think Senegal has ever seen anything like it.” We waited a long time. [The cup] is finally here. We really needed it,” ecstatic fan Modou Ba, 25, told the AFP news agency. There were also scenes of jubilation in the French capital, Paris, home to a large Senegalese community. Thousands of celebrating supporters gathered at the Arc du Triomphe. The winning penalty was scored by captain Sadio Mane. Senegalese President Macky Sall cut short a foreign tour to hold an official reception for the African champions on Tuesday. In a tweet, he congratulated the team, saying: “What a game! What a team! You did it. Beautiful moment of football, beautiful moment of communion and national pride. Congratulations to our heroes.” Senegal have narrowly lost two previous finals, in 2019 and 2002, and were favourites to win the tournament this year.
