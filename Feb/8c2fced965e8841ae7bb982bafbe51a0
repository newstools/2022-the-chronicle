Bulawayo Chiefs gaffer Nilton Terresso has admitted he knows very little of Tenax who are their opponents in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League encounter set for Luveve Stadium this afternoon. Chiefs who lost 1-2 to Chicken Inn last weekend will be hoping for a positive result against the Mutare-based outfit that visits Bulawayo for the second time in this campaign. In their last trip to Bulawayo, Tenax were handed a 3-0 nil beating by Chicken Inn. They, however, managed to beat a Bulawayo team last weekend when they attained a two nil victory over Bulawayo City. It was their first win of the campaign which is in its fourth round. Terreso has no idea of what to expect when the two sides collide today. “In all honesty the hardest part of football here is that there is lack of information.  Very few games are filmed. Of course you may have someone go watch the opponents but for me that’s very difficult I don’t know lots of people around. “There is a very huge gap. It’s very difficult unless we go watch the game ourselves. It’s very difficult to get all the details and in-depth. In terms of preparation, that is a tool that should be utilised more but I don’t know as much about Tenax as I should. But we have a general idea after watching them when they played Chicken Inn but we never know how they change formations and combinations which makes it a bit difficult,” said Terreso. Chiefs got their 2022 business off to a perfect start when they beat FC Platinum 0-2 in their first encounter for the year. The loss to Chicken Inn is unlikely to have demoralised the side who look set to upset a number of sides in the league. -@innocentskizoe
