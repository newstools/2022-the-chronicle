VETERAN Bulawayo rapper POY (real name Nicholas Muchinguri) is hyped up ahead of Cassper Nyovest’s concert taking place in Bulawayo on the 27th of this month. POY, who is set to curtain raise for the ‘Siyathandana’ hit-maker, said he is raring to go.

We’re ready to give a high-level performance that people will enjoy. Those that haven’t had a chance to see POY live will get to feel the energy and experience the highest level of hip-hop performances in the country,” POY said. The artiste confirmed his comeback to the hip-hop game two years ago through his song with Black Orient titled ‘Chikwambo’. This was after a three-year break from the music scene. Now, he is relishing the opportunity to perform again. POY has been in the hip-hop industry for quite a while. He has won two Zim Hip-Hop Awards, one for the People’s Choice Award and the other for Best Album of the Year for the critically-acclaimed ‘Blood Money Jacob’ album. He said for this year, he wants to continue empowering up-and-coming artistes with financial literacy through his company Evolve Ambush Marketing while also targeting clinching deals with corporates. “We’re doing a lot of work targeted at corporate entities in terms of getting endorsements and product placements. This is our main focus for 2022. We’ve been targeting huge brands and have sent proposals.” “We strongly believe something will come up.” POY used to be a brand ambassador for Arizona Spur which helped by sponsoring the Bigger Than Hip hop events, which nurtured the artistes. – @eMKlass_49
