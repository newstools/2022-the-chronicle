FOUNDER and director of Ponel Youth Soccer Academy, Nelson Ndeka, feels placing the right personnel in the administration and technical development is the only way developmental football can improve in Matabeleland North. Ndeka’s academy, which is based in Dete, seeks to promote, teach and develop football at the lowest possible cost in the Dete community.  The academy only began full operations at the end of last year after Covid-19 delayed the start of their activities. Ndeka said the province has a lot of talent that remains untapped because no proper structures are currently in place. “As it is there are no grassroots or youth leagues to compete within the area and province. There is a need to establish clubs so that we have a running league. To improve junior football in Hwange, l believe there must be knowledgeable, practical and passionate football administrators. “Sponsorship and partnership from stakeholders to influence participation of players are also needed. Placing the rightful personnel in positions of administration and technical development is key to ensuring things are run properly and the province churns out the best talent in the country,” said Ndeka. He said there must also be investment in infrastructure. “In our case we share a ground with other Division Three clubs, which is not ideal. We also need total community support, which is key in making sure this project is a success. Some stakeholders seem to lack the understanding of our vision, but we are trying to ensure that we move together with the community. This is the only way we can tap into the vast talent in the province,” said Ndeka.
The academy does not only focus on football, but the education aspect. Twelve budding footballers are set to benefit from the scholarship programme that starts in the first school term on Monday. Ndeka said they hope to increase the number of scholarship beneficiaries with time. – @innocentskizoe
