President Mnangagwa today pays a one-day working visit to Mozambique at the invitation of President Filipe Nyusi for discussions on deepening co-operation and ensuring peace in Mozambique and the whole region. Zimbabwe sent instructors as its contribution to the Sadc effort to fight terrorism in Cabo Delgado and parts of Mozambique’s Sofala and Manica provinces where terrorists and armed groups were carrying out attacks, murders and destruction of public and private infrastructure. The attacks had threatened to undermine peace and development in northern Mozambique.  Deputy Chief Secretary in the office of the President and Cabinet responsible for communication, Mr George Charamba, yesterday said: “It is a bilateral meeting of sister Republics aimed at deepening collaboration particularly in the context of peace and stability both in that country and the region. The security situation in that country will be discussed and how peace can be consolidated not only for the good of that country but the region as a whole.” Zimbabwe and Mozambique enjoy cordial bilateral relations, underpinned by strong historical and political bonds that date back to the liberation struggle The working visit is expected to further deepen existing economic, political, cultural and social relations between the two countries. Today’s meeting is a continuation of last year’s engagement where an extraordinary meeting of regional leaders discussed steps to help end the insurgency which has left more than 6 000 people dead and thousands more homeless. Aid groups estimate that attacks on civilians have displaced close to 500 000 people during four years of terrorism. Cabo Delgado has vast oil and gas deposits estimated to be worth US$60 billion but owing to the threats from militants, development of the natural resources has been slow.
