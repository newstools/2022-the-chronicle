TWO men died upon admission to Kwekwe General Hospital while another one is battling for life after they were stabbed by a man in a fight over a girlfriend. Talcot Mupasi (25) allegedly went on a rampage and stabbed Blessed Sibanda (25) as the two were fighting over a woman. He also allegedly stabbed two other men Hillary Maphosa (21) and Nqaba Ndlovu as they tried to stop the fight. Sibanda and Maphosa later succumbed to the injuries they suffered and Ndlovu is still battling for life. Police have since arrested Mupasi and his younger brother Munashe who is alleged to have assisted his brother in committing the crime. Midlands Police Spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the incident which took place at Cross Roads Business Centre in Silobela. “The now deceased Sibanda and Maphosa were drinking beer at Cross Roads Business Centre together with Talcot Mupasi and his younger brother Munashe. A misunderstanding arose between Sibanda and Talcott over a girlfriend,’ said Insp Mahoko. The argument reportedly degenerated into a fist fight between the two. “Munashe Mupasi intervened and started beating up Sibanda. Talcott then produced a knife and stabbed Sibanda in the back and he fell down,” he said. Maphosa tried to intervene but was also stabbed. “Ndlovu also tried to intervene but was stabbed again in the chest by Talcott,” said Insp Mahoko. After committing the crime, the two siblings fled from the scene leaving the three lying in a pool of blood. The three injured men were rushed to Kwekwe General Hospital where Sibanda and Maphosa were pronounced dead upon admission. Ndlovu is still battling for life and is admitted to the hospital. The Mupasi siblings were later arrested.
