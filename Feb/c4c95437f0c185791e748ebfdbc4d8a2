THE Zimbabwean cricket duo of Blessing Muzarabani and Andy Flower is two games away from archiving yet another historic feat in the ongoing Pakistan Premier League (PSL). The two won the T20 league title with Multan Sultans last year and have again made it to the playoffs in the current edition of the league. The Sultans, who are coached by Flower, will face Lahore Qualanders in a playoff match that could book them a consecutive slot in the final of the competition. <img class="size-full wp-image-589568" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-11-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-11-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-11-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andy Flower In the earlier rounds of the T20 bash, the two teams met twice with Sultans winning the first encounter by five wickets. In their second meeting, Lahore emerged 52-run winners in what has been the Sultans’ only loss this season. When they won the PSL last season, they had lost four of their first five games before turning their form around in the second-leg of the tournament held in Abu Dhabi after the first-half of the league was cut short by the Covid-19 outbreak.  Fast bowler Muzarabani, who has made cameo roles in this campaign, has picked up five wickets in the four matches he has played in. His best figures came in the match against Zalmi in which he picked up three wickets for 18 runs. Another PSL victory for Flower would also further feed into speculation that the former Zimbabwean skipper is being considered for a second stint as England head coach. Flower coached the England team from 2009 to 2014, helping them win the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 and claim a Test series win in India in 2012-13, and also reach the No.1 spot on the ICC Test rankings. – @innocentskizoe
