ISICATHAMIYA ensemble, Amaqaqa finally have something to display in their cupboard after they clinched their debut award at the Zimbabwe Music Awards (Zima) this past weekend. The awards that were held in Harare on Saturday saw the eight-man ensemble from Bulawayo emerging victorious in the Best Traditional (Ezomdabu/Imbube) category where they outshone competition from fellow counterparts Skhosana Buhlungu, Mamozi and Sunduza.  A dream come true it was for the group that was formed four years ago. They had been nominated for the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards, Tesma and Rula Asia awards before but failed to sail through to the winners list. Amaqaqa manager Bongani Mguni said the achievement has inspired them to work even harder adding that it has also ignited the zeal to launch their second album. “We’re very grateful for this gift and it’s such a great achievement for us. Before this, we’d been nominated in a number of awards but failed to make the cut. The Zima win has definitely encouraged us to work harder. “In that manner, we’re planning to host a series of shows in and outside the country as we’re in the process of recording our second album to be titled Ezonsingo,” said Mguni. “This award gave us strength to move forward and it made us realise the power of our music as a small group in the industry. Because we’re an imbube group that’s working very hard, we wish to come up with something that will appeal to everyone.” Amaqaqa, a group that is all about spreading their identity is made up of members Khulekani Khabo, Mlondolozi Dube, Moses Masuku, Mohau Ncube, Jabulani Nyathi, Stanley Mpofu and Njabulo Moyo. They have one album to their name titled Ibhod’elishisayo. – @mthabisi_mthire.
