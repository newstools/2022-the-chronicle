He will be responsible for the VFEX primary and secondary markets, which comprise of new and existing listings, product development, market data, trading and operations. The VFEX was established in October 2020 as a foreign currency-denominated bourse and has to date attracted four giant listings that include, Seed Co International, Padenga, Caledonia and Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC).
