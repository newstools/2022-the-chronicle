FRANTZ Fanon once said: “Each generation out of obscurity must identify its mission, either betray or fulfil it”. Unfortunately this has been a common phrase that is often used in some of the opposition political corridors usually to garner and mobilise innocent young people to engage in the destructive and regressive activities. Some of these activities include demonstrations and protests that have seen the nation losing property worth billions of dollars while also draining the country’s fiscus. The likes of #This Flag, #tajamuka sesijikile and the 2019 alleged fuel protests have heralded some of the ugliest protests and demonstrations that left a trail of destruction. What has remained shocking to a number of progressive and pro-development oriented citizens of this country is how such catastrophic acts are backed by some aspiring political parties and leaders. This however, remains a discourse for another day. While linguists and communication experts would affirm to the notion that messages are polysemic, they mean different things to different people. For progressive and pro-development youths, words have inspired them to locate themselves as key dividends in the demographic structure that will spearhead socio- economic and political transformation. This was evidenced by the thousands of young people from across the country who thronged the Gabriel Mugabe Square in Harare to celebrate the National Youth Day. When those who came before us sacrificed their lives for a free and emancipated Zimbabwe, they did so with passion and determination to ensure that freedom was achieved and this sacrifice must not go in vain! . . . these are some of the sentiments that came from young people as the nation celebrated National Youth Day yesterday. This reporter caught up with some of the young people who expressed their desire to transform the nation, support developmental agendas and create a sustainable future. Mr Bukhosi Ncube, AAG Bulawayo Chapter chairperson echoed the same sentiments. “As we march forward creating a sustainable future through His Excellency’s Vision 2030 and for those that will follow after us, we are committed to rise to the occasion and not be found wanting in the pursuit of the idea of youth development and emancipation. <img class="size-full wp-image-591884" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Dr-Philimon-Nyirenda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Dr-Philimon-Nyirenda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Dr-Philimon-Nyirenda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Philimon Nyirenda We rededicate ourselves to the ideals of those that came before us, we must place youth development at the Centre of Zimbabwe’s development agenda! We must pay homage to his Excellency’s relentless struggles and outstanding foresight,” said Mr Ncube While the informal sector and so called hustling has become a norm for most young people, Mr Ncube said this was not the future. “We too must acknowledge the ongoing challenges faced by the youth on substance and drug abuse, teenage pregnancy and generally the misconception that informal trading and the quick hustle is their future. Our youth are presently and to a large degree misguided in that the quick hustle is now the dominant over career guidance and ambition, to an extent, they have lost many of their role models and look at informal traders as their future and as such we believe we must engage with our city councils, relevant departments in industries and ministries to offer youths opportunities,” said Mr Ncube. He said the socio-economic empowerment and lobby group will ensure programmes are rolled out to  empower the youth. “These should be exciting, challenging and most importantly offer a form of renumeration in recognition of their efforts and rewards for their dedication. Let these programmes be both theoretical and practical as well in order to allow the youth to not only learn a trade but to earn from learning at the same time,” said Mr Ncube. He said most companies outsource a percentage of their works which could provide opportunities for the youth.
“Let’s get our kids off the streets and into these programmes. In these programmes youths should not just develop skills but we should incorporate drug and substance abuse interventions and counselling so that we get the youths back on the right track with the right vision to build a career and future for themselves,” said Mr Ncube. Youth Network Connect is also another group that joined the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, in commemorating the day taking into cognisance the fight in substance and drug abuse. Managing director of the group which is based in Bulawayo called for a collective approach in the fight against drugs and substance abuse.  “The issue of substance and drug abuse needs a universal approach. Youth drug abuse knows no bounds. The reality of youth substance and drug abuse defies all stereotypes. Youth substance and drug abuse is more or less consistent across gender, racial, ethnic, status and geographic boundaries. It is critically important that primary prevention efforts address all young people as well as the adults who influence them. “Involving youth is ideal and to be able to do this, we must continue to build partnerships with as many groups and individuals within our communities. This will increase the resources available but more importantly, it will get a large group of people working towards the same goal. In deciding what community groups are needed, it is important to recognise those that already exist in your community. When building new ones, it is crucial to create community group statements (guidelines) that outline the role and responsibility of each member, so as to reduce substance and drug abuse,” said Dr Philimon Nyirenda. The National Youth Day is celebrated on 21 February in honour of the late National Hero and former President Cde Robert Mugabe who was born on 21 February 1924. The theme for this year’s commemorations is “Alleviate Substance and Drug Abuse by the Youth.”
