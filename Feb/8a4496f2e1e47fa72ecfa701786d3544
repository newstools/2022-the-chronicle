FIFTEEN participants successfully completed a one-week World Athletics International Level 2 middle and long-distance coaching course held in Bulawayo. The course, facilitated by German instructor Karl Gunter Lange, focused on theory application, development of a training programme, biomechanics, physiology and psychology, and attracted 10 coaches from Zimbabwe, two from Botswana and three from Zambia. Two of the 15 participants were women. National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) president Tendai Tagara commended the participants for successfully completing the coaching course. “It was quite a hectic course with both the practical and theoretical aspects proving to be quite a hassle.  The coaches also went through four examinations, the oral, planning, theory and practicals, which they all passed. They appreciated the gravity of the course and were all outstanding,” said Tagara. “Our expert instructor also greatly appreciated the collaboration of the three countries that took part in the course. He is of the view that such collaborations will help the region become a force in long and middle-distance running. The course was delayed by Covid-19 enforced lockdowns last year. Meanwhile, the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) has opened entries for the senior track and field championships to be held on February 20 at White City Stadium.
