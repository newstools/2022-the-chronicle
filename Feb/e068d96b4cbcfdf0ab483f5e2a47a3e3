FAST bowler Blessing Muzarabani missed out on an opportunity to become the fourth Zimbabwean cricketer to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) after failing to find suitors at the league’s auction conducted in Bengaluru. A total of 590 players from around the world were hoping to be signed up by one of 10 IPL franchises. The lanky Chevrons’ bowler was unfortunately among those that were not signed by any side.  He was hoping to become the fourth player from Zimbabwe to ever play in the IPL after Tatenda Taibu, Ray Price and disgraced former skipper Brendan Taylor. Muzarabani is currently playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) for defending champions Multan Sultans. He has so far picked up four wickets in the three matches he has been involved in. Sultans have won six of the seven matches played and have already booked a play-off spot.
