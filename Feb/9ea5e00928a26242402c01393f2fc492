The Chronicle Court Reporter A 46-year-old Bulawayo woman has appeared before the court for  allegedly stealing ore from a mine in Hope Fountain and possessing explosives without a licence. Pennia Macheka appeared before  Bulawayo magistrate Ms Rachel Mukanga on Saturday and was granted bail pending trial. She will be back in court on February 22 when she will be given a trial date. Allegations are that Macheka stole ore last week on Thursday at Rocks Mine in Hope Fountain with the help of her driver Honest Dhlamini who is the co-accused person in the matter. The mine is owned by Mr Bekezela Moyo. Macheka pleaded not guilty to both charges. Magistrate Mukanga granted her $20 000 bail.  “The accused is expected to report to Hillside Police Station twice a week as part of her bail conditions. Dhlamini was also granted $5000 bail pending trial. The State represented by Mr Dominic Moyo alleges that last week on Thursday, Macheka went to Rocks Mine in Hope Fountain in the company of Dhlamini who is the co-accused in one of the charges she is facing of stealing ore at the mine. “On arrival they dug ore and loaded it into a green DAF truck registration number AFN 7493 driven by Dhlamini. The security guard witnessed the incident and reported the issue to police who attended the scene,” said Mr Moyo. “Police tried to reason with Macheka but her employees attacked and overpowered police before disappearing with the ore. Police regrouped and returned to the scene where they recovered the DAF truck and mining equipment which will be presented in court as evidence against the two accused persons.” Macheka was arrested and she produced a prospector’s licence that she claimed gave her power to take ore from the mine.
