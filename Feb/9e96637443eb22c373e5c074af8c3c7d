AFTER over two years of no action on the local front, the Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) is set to resume its activities early next month. The association is set to host a pre-season tournament on March 6 before the league proper starts two weeks later.
BVA held their Annual General Meeting (AGM) at the weekend and one of the major takes from the meeting was the full resumption of local activities. “We successfully held our AGM last weekend. We discussed a number of issues, chief amongst them was the resumption of games. We are excited because we will get back to the court. I am certain that the clubs and players are all looking forward to the resumption. “We are hoping to have an increase of teams that will take part in the league. Clubs that wish to be part of the league are welcome to come and join. We are also going to be placing more emphasis on beach volleyball which has been on the rise. “As an association we want to work to see beach volleyball being played in schools, which is where the development of the game starts. Sitting volleyball is another format of the game we will be concentrating on,” BVA chairperson William Mazviro said.  Teams that are set to take part in the BVA league include Spartans, Highlanders, ZRP Raiders as well as Induna Vikings. Mazviro said league matches are likely to be played at White City Stadium and Milton High School. Highlanders club house may also play host to some of the matches. During the Covid-19 enforced break, BVA came up with var­i­ous projects meant to de­velop and improve the stan­dards of the game in the city. BVA has also en­listed var­i­ous com­mit­tees into its struc­tures in a bid to make its brand more marketable and reach out to stake­hold­ers more ef­fec­tively. These are the ref­erees’ com­mis­sion, players commis­sion, mar­ket­ing com­mis­sion, gen­der com­mis­sion and the coaches and corporate commis­sions. – @innocentskizoe
