THE Matabeleland North Basketball Association (MNBA) will stage two 3×3 competitions in Hwange and Victoria Falls on Saturday. Action in Hwange will take place at the Sports Pavilion, with Falls Club hosting teams based in the resort city. MNBA chairman Simba Munamba said they were on a drive to spread the new format of the game in the province. “We are excited to be hosting these competitions and this is our way of introducing the format to the province. The top three teams from both competitions will progress to the provincial tournament that will take place either in Binga or Lupane. Anyone, regardless of their skills level, is welcome to participate. “In the event that you can provide more than one team of at least three players, you are strongly encouraged to do so. Teams can be mixed gender and any age group. However, for safety reasons, teams may not field more than one Under-14 player,” he said. Registration for both competitions is open and will close on Thursday.  Victoria Falls teams will pay US$10 registration fees, while Hwange teams need US$3.
3×3 is considered the number one urban team sport. From the first official event at the 2010 Youth Olympics Games, FIBA has had an ambitious vision for the game. The format of the game is simple and flexible enough to be played anywhere by anybody. All that’s needed is a hoop, a half-court and six players. Events can be staged outdoors and indoors in iconic locations to bring basketball directly to the people. The rules are simple and designed to make it a fast, spectacular and exciting game. The non-stop music brings an authentic urban culture atmosphere, which attracts a new young audience to the game.
