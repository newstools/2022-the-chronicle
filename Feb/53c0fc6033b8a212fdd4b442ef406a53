The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter
SPORTS and Recreation Commission (SRC) governance and compliance officer Charity Nyamayedenga has said her report on the Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (BUZ)’s elective annual general meeting held at Mtshabezi High School in Matabeleland South last Saturday will be released soon. The AGM was rocked by allegations of rigging before and during the vote after Mashonaland Central was barred from participating for not being in good and regular standing with the BUZ constitution, especially having no active league. Delegates against the decision to bar Mashonaland Central alleged that other provinces like Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West did not have running leagues and neither had some paid affiliation fees. Matabeleland North chairman Simba Munamba and his Matabeleland South counterpart Brighton Ncube even failed to provide Chronicle Sport with a list of teams in their provinces as well as the 2021 season fixtures and results.  The duo is now part of the BUZ executive after they ran unopposed in the elections, with Ncube the new treasurer and Munamba head of the commercial commission. The BUZ presidency was fiercely contested between incumbent Joe Mujuru and challenger David Pick. Mujuru retained his position, allegations abound that those barred from casting their vote were known Pick backers. Nyamayedenga said she was not provided with any documentary evidence proving that all that participated in the meeting were in good standing, but couldn’t query anything as an observer. “I was not provided with any documentation for the congress except the agenda and financial statement. As an observer, I could not query all this. However, I took note of all observations and my report to my superiors and their decision will be shared with the public,” said Nyamayedenga.
