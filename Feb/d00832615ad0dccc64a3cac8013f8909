The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) has concluded a two-day basic athletics training course held at White City Stadium on Saturday and Sunday. The course touched on the basic principles of coaching athletics and was conducted by Vusumuzi Mlilo and attended by eight aspiring coaches. Of the eight, five were female, a development that Bab chairperson Watson Madanyika hailed. “We had five female participants for this course and it shows that women are now taking athletics coaching seriously and want to develop talent not only in the city, but the countryside as a whole. We need to see more women taking up coaching roles. “I believe officials who took part will take the training a step further by implementing what they learnt,” said Madanyika. – @innocentskizoe
