The Chronicle LIVERPOOL kept the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City as Fabinho sealed a 1-0 win over Burnley, while Tottenham’s top four bid suffered a fresh blow in a 2-0 loss to Wolves yesterday. Fabinho struck late in the first half at windswept Turf Moor to give Liverpool their fourth successive league victory.  “It is nine points and then it is 12 points because most of the time City play before us. These are really difficult games. That is why we don’t think about the title race,” Reds boss Jurgen Klopp said. Burnley were in typically aggressive mood, with Alisson Becker forced to save Josh Brownhill’s swirling strike before Wout Weghorst wasted a golden opportunity for the hosts. After a shaky start, Fabinho restored order for Liverpool five minutes before halftime. The Brazilian poked home a fifth goal in his last seven games after Mane headed on Trent Alexander-Arnold’s corner. – SuperSport
