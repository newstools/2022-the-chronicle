A popular DJ from Victoria Falls, Fatso, real name Farai Katuruza, has introduced a silent disco concept in the resort city where music lovers use noise-cancelling eco-friendly headphones to listen to tunes at music events. DJ Fatso introduced the system last year and it has become a hit at leisure centres like nightclubs frequented by tourists, as well as at boat cruises and meetings. <img class="alignnone wp-image-591482 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Silent-Disco-new-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Silent-Disco-new-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Silent-Disco-new-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> People attending various events or enjoying tourism activities have used the product as they are handed a set of wireless headphones from where they access and listen to music. Instead of using a PA system, music is broadcast via a radio transmitter with the signal being picked up by wireless headphone receivers worn by the participants. DJ Fatso said this concept has been embraced by many as it allows those who may want to be doing other things to do so without noise disturbance. “This silent disco concept was launched last year as we wanted to develop an eco-friendly product to allow people to party in the national park without inconveniencing others. We launched the groove cruise using this concept and I’m glad to say that it’s gaining traction from Victoria Falls residents and the domestic tourism market with inquiries from other cities,” said DJ Fatso.  He said plans are underway to expand to trains, game parks and other areas of interest where noise is not permitted. Bush parties and outdoor dinners are popular in Victoria Falls especially among corporates when they host international conferences. This, however, sometimes attracts backlash from wildlife activists who will be concerned about the disturbance of natural habitat. The silent disco could, therefore, be the tonic Victoria Falls needs for co-existence with wildlife. DJ Fatso said through the silent disco concept, one has access to a wider selection of music as different genres can be played by different DJs at the same time. He said their target market is that section of society that appreciates innovation and upholds technological developments. “We also look at getting those who love eco-friendly products as our products emit zero to minimal noise and air pollution. Since the tourism industry is looking forward to welcoming more tourists from international markets, we want revellers to have almost the same party experience as they have overseas, but incorporating an African theme and conserving the environment,” he said. The tourism industry has welcomed the product with Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe Matabeleland North chairperson Arnold Musonza saying it suits conservation focus in that it has no noise effect. “The silent disco is one of the greatest innovations by one of our local artistes and entertainment professional, DJ Fatso. This is a very innovative development which should be embraced and supported for the sake of noiseless entertainment in Victoria Falls,” Musonza said. Victoria Falls Hotel general manager Farai Chimba said the silent disco will attract the younger generation to the destination. “It’s innovative and adds to the diversity. We have to bear in mind that what the older and usual clientele enjoys does not attract a young crowd hence such innovative products strike a balance with nature and traveller preferences.” – @ncubeleon
