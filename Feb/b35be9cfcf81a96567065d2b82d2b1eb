The Chronicle John 16 vs 13     NIV
“But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.” If you keep trying the same thing and expecting a different result but somehow you don’t seem to be able to achieve it, it calls for a change in approach. One of the hardest things to do is to change one’s direction when you have firmly set your mind to doing something a certain way. Sometimes we attribute our actions to an inner voice that goes beyond our comprehension but somehow we are certain that our intended course is correct even though it’s not yielding the intended result.  We often attribute our inner desires that become silent voices to the Lord but we must sometimes question if that voice is really from above. Clarity can be difficult to attain but for what the Lord has intended, He will provide a way. Are you in doubt? Are you at a place where you need answers? Listen carefully and engage the Lord diligently. Events, circumstances, unusual occurrences, and chance encounters all speak of something greater. Take a closer look at all these and as you do, the Lord will show you where to go. Be blessed
