HIGHLANDERS’ elections for a new vice-chairman and treasurer held at the clubhouse on Sunday were flawless, according to returning officer Peter Dube, who thanked the 253 members that cast their vote. Fiso Siziba won the vice-chairman’s contest, polling 202 votes compared to Babongile Skhonjwa’s 51, while Busani Mthombeni claimed the treasurer’s post with 140 votes against Xolisani Moyo’s 112. Key to note in Sunday’s vote was the increase in the number of members that came to vote compared to 135 that turned up for the same elections won by Modern Ngwenya and Donald Ndebele in 2019.  In the 2016 poll, 195 people turned up. “The elections were flawless and there was a significant increase in voter turnout, something that shows that members want to be involved in the club’s affairs. Despite having a flawless election, this is not to say there were no hiccups; there was order and a few grumblings. We thank members for behaving in an orderly manner and as an electoral college, we’ll keep on improving,” said Dube. No vehicles were allowed into the club house premises to avoid congestion. Two verification points were set up to plug electoral loopholes, with the first at the main gate entrance where members were allowed into the clubhouse in batches. The second point was at the door for collection of ballot papers. — @ZililoR
