The Chronicle Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8).
WHEN we say, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever,” it isn’t a statement we made up, neither is it a cliché. It’s absolute TRUTH and it came from the Scriptures! Jesus hasn’t changed. He’s the same, yesterday, today and forever. Oftentimes when people go through difficulties, in their frustration, they cry, “Oh God, where are you?” <img class="alignnone wp-image-633820 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The reason is that they’re ignorant of the fact that God has already laid out a good plan for them (Ephesians 2:10). He has a good plan for every man, woman, boy or girl. Nevertheless, except and unless they look into the Scriptures, they may never discover that plan. And when they don’t discover it, they may cry, beg or plead, and it’ll look like God isn’t listening to them; meanwhile, He already provided the solution ever before they were born.  But how can they know, except someone shows it to them? (Romans 10:14). That’s why He sent us to preach the Gospel. The Bible, for example, tells us in Psalm 33:5 that “…the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.” Yet, the experience of a good number of people is one of sadness, pain, frustration. Why is it so? Has God changed? Absolutely not! There’re two major reasons for this, aside ignorance: the number one reason is that here’s a devil that makes them blind to God’s perfect will. The second reason is that other human beings who are inspired by Satan and the demons of darkness afflict other people with their selfishness and greed. They’ve used their own wickedness to frustrate other men. <img class="alignnone wp-image-633823 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It’s man’s inhumanity to man. God knew what would happen and that’s the reason He planned the answer long before you came. The answer is Jesus Christ! If you embrace the life that He brought and walk in the light of it, His glory will be manifested in your life. And in spite of the two aforementioned factors, you can use the power of His Name to live above Satan and the systems of this world. His Name has power in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth. PRAYER Thank you, dear Lord, for the honour of helping people discover Jesus and their inheritance in Christ. I pray for new converts and God’s people around the world today, that they walk in the reality of the fullness of the blessings of Christ, in Jesus’ Name. Amen
