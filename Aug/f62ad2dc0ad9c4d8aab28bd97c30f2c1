THE Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Monica Mutsvangwa has said the late Cont Mhlanga used the arts in nation building as well as to break creed, tribe, colour, religion, gender and racial barriers. <img class="wp-image-608494 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) Mhlanga (64) succumbed to pneumonia on Monday at the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) where he had been admitted for 10 days. In a statement, Minister Mutsvangwa said Mhlanga knew the value of the arts to humanity, nation-building and civilisation. “He used the arts to break every form of barrier be it a creed, tribe, colour, religion, gender or race. Arts are the thread that knits together the soul of humanity in time from one generation to another. Concurrently in space across regions and continents,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. She said Mhlanga worked hard to uncover talent and nurture it. “He knew arts reside in human creativity. He tirelessly, methodically and meticulously worked hard. He mined gems in human creative endowment and polished them for the delights and anguishes of the soul as society moves along,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. She said Mhlanga helped artistes build livelihoods and find sustenance. “Salute to Cont Mhlanga from the musicians, the actors and their directors and all those who survive on the arts,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. <img class="wp-image-572440 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-26-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-26-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-26-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Zwelibanzi Ndlovu Fairtalk Board chairperson Mr Zwelibanzi Ndlovu described Mhlanga as Zimbabwe’s greatest arts and culture icon. Mhlanga was one of the shareholders at Fairtalk Communications and served as the founding vice-chairman of the company’s board. “Known as Malume to some and Khulu to others, Mhlanga had a long, rewarding and impactful career in the arts and culture industries dating back to the 1980s when he founded Amakhosi initially as a Martial art cum theatre group. The group made waves across many schools and community halls in the city,” said Mr Ndlovu. Experiencing rapid growth Amakhosi soon emerged as the foremost hub for talent development in the arts and culture sector. Mr Ndlovu described Amakhosi Cultural Centre as Zimbabwe’s spiritual home for the arts. “Riding on the vision and talents of Mhlanga, the group later established the iconic Amakhosi Cultural Centre, Zimbabwe’s spiritual home for the arts. Many award-winning stage dramas, movies, soapies and TV dramas followed as everything he touched turned into gold. Aptly so, Mhlanga was recognised locally, regionally and internationally as Zimbabwe’s arts godfather and the awards bear testimony,” he said. <img class="wp-image-478136 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Skyz-Metro-FM-Awards-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Skyz-Metro-FM-Awards-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Skyz-Metro-FM-Awards--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Skyz Metro FM Mr Ndlovu said Mhlanga was instrumental in securing the broadcasting licences for Skyz Metro FM, Breeze FM and recently Keyona TV, all of which benefited from his years of experience, knowledge and his passion for delivering cutting edge content to audiences. Mr Ndlovu said Mhlanga’s passing leaves a huge abyss in the entertainment industry. “The death of Cont Mhlanga is like watching a whole library of Zimbabwe’s arts and culture burning down and yet we still find time and space to celebrate this Giant from Lupane.” Bulawayo mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni said Mhlanga was a visionary and pioneer who spearheaded many projects in the Creative Arts industry. He said Mhlanga was instrumental in the formation of the Bulawayo Cultural Affairs Office (BCAO). “He was a Bulawayo citizen at heart serving the city and championing the telling of its story through arts, film and theatre and spearheading a number of projects with great leadership, passion and excellence,” said Clr Mguni. He said Bulawayo learnt with sadness of the passing on of the renowned arts administrator, playwright, filmmaker, creative director and City of Bulawayo Civic Honours recipient. “The city has lost a legend in the Creative industries who began his career in the arts and karate at a young age and is known for the formation of the Amakhosi Arts Centre, Skyz Metro FM and Breeze FM,” said Clr Mguni. Mhlanga was awarded the Civic Honours award on October 18, 2002 in recognition of his role in the introduction and subsequent development of theatrical art in Bulawayo particularly the setting up of Amakhosi Theatre Production. “This was in recognition of the fact that community theatre became world renowned and was a great tool in the marketing of the culture and inspirations of the people of Bulawayo,” said Clr Mguni.  The resolution to award Civic Honours was made on July 3, 1963 and Mhlanga became the 67th recipient joining other citizens who had brought distinction to the city. The mayor said Mhlanga’s vision and commitments will be treasured for many years to come. <img class="wp-image-579403 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Rodney-Ruwende.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Rodney-Ruwende.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Rodney-Ruwende-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rodney Ruwende In its condolence message, the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) said it was saddened by Mhlanga’s death
NACZ communication and marketing manager Mr Rodney Ruwende said Mhlanga will be remembered for his life dedicated to the cultural and creative industries which he used to champion the human rights cause as well as articulating the country’s socio-economic and political situation. “He was a great mentor who, through Amakhosi he has helped to discover and mentor some of the country’s talented artists and professional groups alike,” he said. Last year, Mhlanga was one of the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) 40 Legends who were given honorary awards as part of Zimbabwe’s 40th Independence Anniversary. “The death of Mhlanga, an internationally acclaimed playwright, filmmaker and creative director is particularly difficult to fathom coming at a time he had been recently appointed as a member of the National Team for the creation of a national strategy for the Zimbabwe Film Sector,” said Mr Ruwende. — @mashnets
