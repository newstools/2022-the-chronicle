THE Bulawayo Under-19 cricket team is preparing to go to Harare for trials which will be used to select the under-19 national team that will do duty in International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned games. <img class="wp-image-634246 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-38.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-38.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-38-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> International Cricket Council (ICC) Cup The trials will be held from August 8 to 10. The team started the preparations by playing a T20 against the U21s at Bulawayo Athletic Club two weeks ago. Last weekend they played another game, a 50 over match against the U23s at the same venue which they won by 18 runs. Speaking to Chronicle Sport, Bulawayo U19 head coach, Pollock Mubobo was happy with the performance that his boys showed in the two matches.  He also emphasised the importance of mental preparedness, as the key to winning games, stating that it’s now only in his players’ minds to get the job done. “With these games we have played, they are ready, it’s now in the mind,” said Mubobo. The players will be mixed up and put into four different select sides where they will compete against each other to come up with one team. From about 52 players they will then come up with a final team of 25. According to the coach, the players must repeat the performances that they put in the previous trials. He believes in them and knows his boys are hungry to make the squad. “All we need to do is repeat those good performances,” he said. The last time trials were conducted, 13 boys from the province made the team, three from the development, four from Christian Brothers College and six from Falcon College.
