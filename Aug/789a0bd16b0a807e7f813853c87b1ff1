EASTERN Region Division One Soccer League side Green Fuel FC are 11 points from claiming the championship and securing a premier soccer league ticket. Coached by Lloyd Mutasa, the former Dynamos and FC Platinum coach, Green Fuel edged closer to promotion at the weekend following a 3-0 win over sixth-placed FC Wangu Mazodze, to take their points tally to 59 from 23 games. The Eastern Region Division One Soccer League side enjoy a 14-point lead over second placed Mutare City Rovers who have a game in hand. Still unbeaten in 23 league matches, Green Fuel will win the league title if they reach an unassailable 70 points, meaning they need three wins and two draws to bag the championship. Mutare City Rovers can only end the season on 69 points if they win all their remaining matches. Former premier league side Masvingo United are a distant third with 38 points while Chiredzi Stars are fourth with 34 points. It is the Central Region Soccer League (CRSL) that will have the first team promoted to the PSL from the four Zifa divisions, with their season set to be wrapped up in two weeks’ time. The championship race in the 14-team CRSL is a two-horse race between the John Nyikadzino-coached Sheasham and second-placed TelOne. <img class="wp-image-633847 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> John Nyikadzino Sheasham top the table with 54 points, two ahead of TelOne. Sheasham, still unbeaten in 24 games were held to a 0-0 draw away to fourth placed Tongogara, delaying their promotion, while TelOne walked over Dulibadzimu United and were awarded maximum points on a 3-0 scoreline. It is surprising that Dulibadzimu, who have been able to fulfill their fixtures, decided against travelling to Gweru to face TelOne at a time when the championship race is in the final stretch. Sheasham need four points from their remaining two games to secure promotion and with TelOne breathing heavily at their back, the final episode should be interesting. It’s a tightly contested three-team title race in the Northern Region. Herentals lead with 54 points, followed by Simba Bhora on 53 and Golden Eagles on 50.  Simba Bhora’s 1-1 draw against Golden Valley cost them top spot as they were leapfrogged by Herentals who beat Karoi United 2-0. Golden Eagles drew 1-1 away at Chinhoyi Stars, a result that took them off the track. In the Southern Region, the coalminers Hwange beat Bosso 90 by three goals to one in Bulawayo to maintain a five-point lead over second placed ZPC Hwange. The coalminers top the table with 60 points from 24 games. A slip up by Hwange could hand ZPC Hwange an advantage should they also maintain a fine run. Arenel, who edged Emakhandeni Pirates 1-0, are the championship dark-horses, sitting on third place with 53 points. There are 30 points to fight for in the Southern Region, meaning there might be more twists and turns along the way. Top four logs Central Region P     W     D     L     F     A     GD     Pts
