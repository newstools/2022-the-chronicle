Food lovers in Bulawayo are in for a double treat this month as Munch & Sip food fiesta is bouncing back, this time not with food only, but with the people’s favourite girl, Gemma Griffiths. The event that was last held in Bulawayo in April has been upgraded from just being an outing to appreciating the art of food and drink while being captivated by music. It has surely lived up to its adage “food is our creativity”. Munch & Sip food market founder Mandipa Masuku said food will be celebrated during the event as attendees will have an opportunity to sample different dishes. <img class="wp-image-633970 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandipa Masuku She said they decided to rope in Gemma as her music is fitting for the event. “We chose Gemma because we appreciate her jazz-like music. Her music will definitely be something good for the soul during the day. We want people to enjoy the food while listening to good music,” she said. Supporting artists will be DJ Ryan Synth, DJ Reezy and Just Drey. To also spice things up at the famous food market, Masuku said the forthcoming event will have a munch-off. “Three chefs will take on the challenge to become the best sweet food chef. Gifts will be won and food will be celebrated,” she said. The food court will feature much-loved Magriza Made Me Cook, a Sokos Butcher’s block, Cooking with Michie, Maxhosa Hubbly Garden, and Nduna Burgers among others, giving foodies a wide range of selection. <img class="alignnone wp-image-633973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Masuku said they are working on perfecting the event to suit both the young and                                        old. “This time around, we’re working on perfecting our event and making sure that our objectives are clear from the word go. Our objectives include making Zimbabwe attractive and getting people hooked on the art of food and drink. “We also want to create lifestyle events with quality entertainment for the young and old that does not involve drinking, but the conscious appreciation of the event,” she said.  Through Munch & Sip, Masuku said they want to challenge Zimbabweans to use indigenous ingredients to come up with unique food ideas. “For example, corn bread and seswaa or a remake of chocolate spread using umtshwankela as done by P Mahlangu,” she said. Preparations for the event that will be held at Matopos Sailing Club on August 28, Masuku said, are going on well with tickets already on sale. The last event was held in Victoria Falls for the first time during the Vic Falls Carnival. – @SeehYvonne
