Government lifted the ban on schools’ sporting activities in May following a two-year hiatus that was part of preventive measures to contain Covid-19. Primary schools were granted authority to resume all sporting activities, but lack of financial backing forced Naph to have four disciplines at the national ball games finals. <img class="wp-image-621265 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-469.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-469.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-469-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Cynthia Khumalo Cynthia Khumalo, the Naph president, said the excitement that has gripped primary schools’ learners as well as teachers has made them decide to continue with sporting activities next term. “We had good games in Bulawayo and even though we had four disciplines, there was a lot of excitement from learners and teachers who missed competing. “What we are planning is to continue with sporting activities in the third term because we had limited time for learners to participate in games. The third term is traditionally reserved for music and drama, but this time around we will have more ball games played,” said Khumalo.  At the just ended national finals, Manicaland and Mashonaland West shared equally the winners’ medals. Manicaland took home the netball and basketball trophies while Mashonaland West walked away with the football and volleyball medals. <img class="wp-image-459983 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Zimbabwe-Volleyball-Association.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Zimbabwe-Volleyball-Association.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Zimbabwe-Volleyball-Association-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Volleyball Manicaland were crowned netball champions after beating Mashonaland West 20-11 in the final.
