THE Covid-19 induced lockdown resulted in the closure of many businesses worldwide but for Ms Sanelisiwe Ngwenya from Gwanda, it marked the start of a flourishing detergent making venture . <img class="wp-image-614584 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 Ms Ngwenya closed her salon in March 2020 and took advantage of the spare time she had at the time to receive training in detergent making. She established a company, Sunshine Detergents which has become a major supplier of home made cleaning and washing detergents in Gwanda town. Ms Ngwenya supplies local shops, car wash outlets and the community. She produces dish washing liquid, washing powder, toilet cleaner, laundry soap, floor polish, petroleum jelly, pine jelly, foam bath, fabric softener and car cleaning detergents among other products. Last month she made about US$450 profit from selling detergents. <img class="wp-image-634198 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-24.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-24.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-24-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> detergents Her other source of income is being a hair dresser. Since she closed her salon she attends to house calls. Ms Ngwenya also produces confectioneries. She realises about R4 000 a month through baking. The single mother, said her business has enabled her to take care of her two children. She is also looking after her late cousin’s four children. In a week she produces 80 litres of dishwashing liquid, 20 litres of pine jelly, 20 litres of toilet cleaner, 40 litres of floor polish, which are her top selling products. “I received training in detergent making in 2020 during the lockdown. I was trained by a businessman in Bulawayo who produces detergents. Before I moved into the business I was operating a salon in the CBD and I was also into baking. I got skills in baking from my mother,” she said. “Under detergent making I was first trained in making dish washing liquid. I started selling it to my neighbours and with time people knew that they could buy their dishwashing liquid from me. I realised that detergent making was a viable business and then I decided to learn how to make other detergents so that I could offer my customers variety.” She said her major customers are members of the community and those into car washing. Ms Ngwenya said she produces the detergents at home. She said she makes it a point to make good quality products to keep her customers satisfied. She buys her ingredients in Bulawayo. Ms Ngwenya said some people tend to use less than the recommended quantity of ingredients thereby compromising quality. She said she focuses more on quality than quantity. This has helped her to retain old customers and get new ones. Ms Ngwenya said it was important to make a product as though one was making it for personal use. As a way to give back to the community which supports her, Ms Ngwenya said she trains people in detergent making. She recently trained Gwanda Prison inmates. “It gives me joy to impart the knowledge I have acquired to others.  There are some women from my community that I have trained in detergent making and some have gone on to start their own businesses. I was called to train inmates at Gwanda Prison. Detergent making can be a reliable source of income if taken seriously,” she said. “As a single mother I realised that I had to do something to sustain my family. God gifted me with these hands and I decided to use them to earn a living. In my enterprise I always endeavour to expand and incorporate more products. When I started off I had one product but now I can produce close to 20 products. I intend to add more.” She said her desire was to produce in bulk and be able to supply big supermarkets. Ms Ngwenya said resources were limiting the amount of detergents that she makes. She said her plan was to start a small factory with some machinery where she could produce in bulk and also employ people. Ms Ngwenya said she wanted her brand Sunshine Detergents to become a household name . – @DubeMatutu.
