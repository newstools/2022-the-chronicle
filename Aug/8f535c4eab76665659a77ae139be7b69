In a statement, the Zimbabwe Chess Federation (ZFC) said this is the first time in the last decade to have a national event hosted in Bulawayo. Speaking to Chronicle Sport, public relations, media and communication director of ZFC, Thabo Tawanda Elisha said he is happy to see the tournament being held in Bulawayo. “Chess is decentralised, Harare used to be a hub of tournaments but now it’s changing,” Elisha said.
The tournament is open for all chess players from around Zimbabwe. There will be an open section for everyone, women’s section and a scholars section and when one registers, they get into either one of those categories.  Open and women’s sections registration is US$5 for ZFC affiliates and US$10 for non-affiliates. For the development section, which caters for the under 14s, it’s US$2 for ZCF affiliates and $5 for non-affiliates. The deadline for registration is August 4. In terms of time control in the tournament, it will be 61 minutes + 5 seconds per player. Winners will then qualify to contest for the national title.
