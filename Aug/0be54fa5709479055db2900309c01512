The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls VICTORIA Falls is set to have its first town houses following construction of two massive housing projects by the private sector with a combined 120 units. Construction of Miombo Mews by Harare-based Candev Property Development and Victoria Falls Estate by Cardinal Corporation with 26 units and 94 units of high-rise flats respectively, is underway and both projects are targeted to be complete early next year. The projects buttress the country’s National Development Strategy 1(NDS1) in which the Government targets to build 200 000 housing units by 2025 in partnership with the private sector. Victoria Falls housing backlog is close to 15 000. National Housing and Social Amenities Minister, Daniel Garwe, has said Government cannot achieve the set targets alone but with the help of private sector, which he said has responded positively to the new National Human Settlement Policy, which stipulates the need to build vertically to save land. <img class="wp-image-619480 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Daniel Garwe Minister Garwe led his counterparts and delegates from the continent who were attending the recent 41st Shelter Afrique symposium to have an appreciation of the projects. Shelter Afrique pledged US$25 million sovereign fund to Zimbabwe for construction of 3 000 housing units countrywide. “These are some of the projects by private sector to clear the housing backlog in the country. One has 94 units and the other site has 26 units,” said Minister Garwe. He said he wanted the delegates to have an appreciation of the housing projects as the Government was doing away with informal settlements and land barons. <img class="wp-image-633445 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-34-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-34-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-34-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> solar geysers Minister Garwe said while Government is pursuing vertical construction of housing structures to save land, it is also planning to have rent for ownership type of accommodation whereby people would rent properties to buy. The two projects are being built using smart technology material comprising double insulated ceilings to moderate heat and noise as they are roofed with zinc roofing sheets and have aluminum windows and solar geysers.  Both schemes are already connected to water, sewer and road network in line with the new housing policy to have services before occupation of houses. Miombo Mews is on a 1,5ha piece of land between Chinotimba and Mkhosana and is being spearheaded by Candev Property Development and comprise two-bedroom apartments with an ensuite, two toilets, an open plan dining and kitchen and veranda. Two units share a car park. The contractor Mr Ed Whitefield, who is spearheading the project with Mr Stuart Cumming said about US$5 million was invested in the project. <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay Mr Whitefield said to buy each apartment one needs US$188 000 and that 20 of the 26 apartments have been bought already. “Tourism is coming up, which is why we want to put housing for people in this city. We started construction in October last year and we intend to finish in February next year. This is good investment for people to buy or rent and we are able to furnish if people want,” he said. Mr Whitefield said they used local resources mostly like stones and bricks made in Hwange and solar will be the main source of energy in line with the smart city concept. The Victoria Falls Estate is located along Kazungula Road and comprises 34 double storey apartments, 30 double storey duplex town houses, 20 free standing single storey bungalows and 10 luxury double storey villas on a 5ha piece of land. One needs US$120 000 to buy the cheapest apartment with two bedrooms and US$350 000 for a three-bedroomed apartment. Mr Andrew Lane said construction started in 2020 and all the apartments will be ready in March next year. —@ncubeleon
