Learners, parents and the institutions all played and are still playing a role to the growth of Simbisa. ‘We opened the first Chicken Inn in 1987 at Speke Avenue in Harare and today we operate more than 230 stores across the country,” he said. “On that note we come in here as obliged by the plight of some learners who need the support of the corporate world.  These are our future leaders, therefore, Simbisa Brands is here to invest in them. “Simbisa’s growth hasn’t been easy neither has it been a single-handed effort, but together with every Zimbabwean who has supported our brand we have grown and expanded to Mauritius, Namibia, DRC, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Swaziland and Ghana. “As a business that is growing from Zimbabwe outward, we are committed to being part of the continuous improvement in our communities and livelihoods. Hence today we invest in these learners through the payment of school fees. “To all the beneficiaries we pray that they be determined and resolute as they focus on their studies,” said Mr Ncube. <img class="size-full wp-image-520435" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Taungana-Ndoro.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Taungana-Ndoro.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Taungana-Ndoro-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Taungana Ndoro Director of communications and advocacy in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Mr Taungana Ndoro said the ministry was grateful for the gesture, which is in line with the Government’s thrust not to leave anyone behind. “We are so grateful as a ministry when we see corporates like Simbisa supporting vulnerable pupils through paying their school fees. It is in line with Government policy that seeks to ensure no one is left behind in developmental issues. “The donation will go a long way in changing the lives of the pupils who benefitted from this gesture,’ said Mr Ndoro.
