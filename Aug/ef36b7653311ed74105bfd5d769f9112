He was your child as a family but he was now ours. He was a principled cadre and is among a few who towed the correct line of the revolution from the beginning to the end,” President Mnangagwa said. The President narrated how he had met Brig-Gen Mabenge (Rtd) during the liberation war at Xai Xai after (the President) had been released from prison and stayed together for a few days. He had the mourners in stitches when he narrated how the late national hero whose Chimurenga name was Cde Freddie Matanga would bring chillies to meals when he knew they would make him sneeze. He added that because of his intelligence and commitment Brig-Gen (Rtd) Mabenge had been appointed commander of Gaza Province and later as Zanu-PF’s representative in the Middle East. “When we thought of having someone who would represent us in the Middle East we settled on him following a meeting between President Mugabe, Vice-President Simon Muzenda, Cde Edgar Tekere because of his intelligence,” he added. <img class="wp-image-465426 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/bob.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/bob.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/bob-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late President Robert Mugabe “Freddie was meticulous in whatever he did, he was very meticulous and when you discussed issues with him he would record everything and would always remind you of what you said if ever you tried to change.” President Mnangagwa said after the independence, Brig-Gen Matanga was attested into the Zimbabwe National Army where he rose through the ranks to Brigadier-General but eventually retired. “He however, he remained one of us that is why you would see that he would occasionally be appointed to various positions in State institutions,” he said. When the Second Republic came in, the President said, it took a decision to address the welfare of former commanders of the liberation war. “So recently I asked the Vice-President about his (Brig-Gen Mabenge) whereabouts and he told me he was there but not feeling well so I assigned him to make arrangements to bring him (Brig-Gen Mabenge) here to receive medical attention and I was always updated on his condition until yesterday (Monday) around 7AM by the Vice-President that he had received a call from Dr Maxwell Hove that Freddie was no more,” he said. In a statement earlier, President Mnangagwa said the death of Brig-Gen Mabenge (Rtd) had come as a shock to him. General (Retd) Benjamin Mabenge, came as a great shock to me personally and to those among us who once shared the trenches with him during our war of National Liberation. Popularly known by his Chimurenga name, Freddie Matanga, the late freedom fighter ranked highly among our leading ZANLA field commanders whose contribution to the National Liberation Struggle was very admirable. He operated in the then Gaza Province as Provincial Commander for the region during which the ZANLA forces scored notable gains against the enemy forces,” he said. “After the struggle, Cde Matanga was attested into the Zimbabwe National Army where he rose through the ranks to Brigadier General, the rank he occupied on retirement in 1988. On retirement, the late Brigadier General continued to serve his country faithfully in various civilian portfolios and special assignments as a senior member of our Party, Zanu-PF, and as a war veteran. His passing on has robbed our Nation of an intelligent, outspoken, diligent and bold revolutionary cadre who frowned upon corruption in any form or shape. He will be solely missed by all of us.” In his address, Vice-President General Constantino Chiwenga (Retired) said he had met Brig-Gen Mabenge (Rtd) in 1974 at Mgagao and narrated how the late national hero became his commander in Gaza province. <img class="wp-image-446885 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Vice-President-Retired-General-Chiwenga-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Vice-President-Retired-General-Chiwenga-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Vice-President-Retired-General-Chiwenga-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vice President Constantino Chiwenga The VP said they had a close relationship with the national hero, who always referred him as uncle.
