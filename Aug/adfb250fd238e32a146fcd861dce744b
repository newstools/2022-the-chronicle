THE late national hero, Brigadier-General Benjamin Mabenge (retired) who died on Monday, has been described as a soldier par excellence, a disciplinarian and a unifier who would put his country ahead of everything else. A liberation fighter whose Chimurenga name was Cde Freddie Matanga, Brig-Gen Mabenge died on Monday at a hospital in Harare and has since been declared a national hero. He will be buried at the National Heroes Acre today. <img class="wp-image-616663 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Heroes Acre His body was flown from Harare to his Kwekwe farm where mourners gathered to pay their last respects before it was flown back to the capital for burial at the national shrine. If mourners from diverse backgrounds and across the political divide who thronged his Woodlands Farm to pay their last respects are anything to go by, then indeed Brig General Mabenge had an impact on most lives. Zanu-PF Midlands provincial member, Cde Moses Murada who worked with the late hero before and after independence, described him as a disciplinarian who stood by his word. He said they met in 1979 before they worked together during elections in 2002 when Brig-Gen Mabenge was deployed to lead the Zanu-PF campaign in Kwekwe. “He unified people within the party within a short space of time and for that reason he was promoted to be in charge of election campaigns for the whole province. But as a straightforward man, he did not go behind anyone’s back but he would confront you when you misfired. He was a straightforward man who stood for the truth,” said Cde Murada. During the land reform programme, Brig-Gen Mabenge played a critical role in Kwekwe. “He was the leader during the land reform and we all followed behind his wise leadership. He was a shining beacon that we would always rely on for advice. But most of the young people would avoid him because he was very strict and would discipline you there and there,” he said. His last-born son, Cde Savior Mabenge described his father as a disciplinarian who brought order in the family and the community at large. “When he retired from the army, I was still very young but growing up with him, he was a loving father but one who did not want to cut corners. We looked up to our father and our family hero and we are grateful to President Emmerson Mnangagwa for according him the hero status that I think he truly deserved,” he said. Cde Mabenge said he wished he could have learnt more from his father. “When I heard about his passing on, that is when I realised that I could have learnt more than I leant. I was still in the learning process when he died.  But all the same, we have to be proud of what we managed to siphon from him during his time and we celebrate his life and legacy,” he said. His farm, just outside Mbizo suburb, became a no-go area for wood poachers. “As you can see the proximity of our farm to Mbizo, people would usually sneak into the farm to poach firewood. But he brought order and everyone knew that if you wanted firewood, approach him for permission and he would assist you with the firewood. What he didn’t want was the random cutting down of trees as he was very fond of the environment,” he said. <img class="wp-image-625177 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Ward 11 Councilor Washington Moyo (Citizens Coalition for Change) echoed the same sentiments saying the late Brig Gen Mabenge had brought order in the ward and cutting down of trees had become a thing of the past. Cllr Moyo said Brig-Gen Mabenge put his country ahead of anything else. “I would frequently visit him at his farm and we would discuss a number of things. What he wanted was order in the manner things were done. He didn’t want people who cut corners when doing something. He emphasized the notion that Zimbabwe was more important than political parties hence he would accommodate everyone,” he said. The same sentiments were echoed by opposition activists, Mr Nkosilathi Moyo who said he also frequented the farm for discussions with the late hero. “He said Zimbabwe was more important and whatever differences we have emanating from diverse political backgrounds, were not more important than Zimbabwe. I would frequent his farm and I learnt a lot from him,” said Mr Moyo. Close family friend, Retired Major George Valentine Makombe said the later Brig-Gen Mabenge was more than a soldier. “I knew him in 1977 and from there we were working together during the war of liberation. What I can say is that he was a soldier who was different from the rest. He was a real commander together with the late Major-General Paradzai ‘Tonderai Nyika’ Zimondi and the late Air Chief Marshal Perence Shiri all of whom I had the privilege of working under,” he said. After the war, the two worked together and they became very close. “I ended up being a part of his family. Our families became so close to such an extent that one of my children once stayed with Brig Gen Mabenge at their homestead. He was a political giant too who did not mince his words when it comes to patriotism and nationalism,” said Rtd Major Makombe. A church service was held at the farm before the body was flown to Harare for burial. Brig-Gen Mabenge is survived by wife Rosegema, six children and 10 grandchildren.
