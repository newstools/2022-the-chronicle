The Chronicle Business Reporter ZIMBABWE is expected to participate in the sixth Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) annual industrialisation week, a platform that brings together multiple faceted players to explore ways on how the region can contribute to poverty reduction through industrialisation and structural transformation of economies. The Democratic Republic of Congo is hosting the event which kicks off today and runs until Saturday under the theme “Promoting industrialisation through agro-processing, mineral beneficiation, and regional value chains for inclusive and resilient economic growth”. In a statement, the SADC secretariat said the annual event provides a platform for member states, the private sector, international cooperating partners, multinational corporations, regional and global policy makers, research institutions and academia, small and medium enterprises, development finance institutions and civil society to interact and share experiences on how best the region can contribute to poverty reduction through industrialisation and structural transformation of our economies. The SADC Council of Ministers endorsed the convening of the annual SIW to intensify engagement with various partners, including the private sector to accelerate the implementation of the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap 2015-2063. “The SIW aims to foster new opportunities for intra-African trade, developing cross-border value chains, and identifying investment opportunities in Southern Africa. “The sixth SIW will have presentations by industry experts and mandated government officials, parallel sessions, exhibitions and field visits to manufacturing and production economic areas as well as tourism site in the Congo River,” reads part of the statement. The sectors earmarked to participate in the SIW include mineral beneficiation, agro processing, pharmaceuticals, fast moving consumer goods, infrastructure and logistics, light manufacturing, the automotive and financial sector.
