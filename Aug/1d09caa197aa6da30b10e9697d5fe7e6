A community in Ward 1 area in Bulilima District came together and raised R275 000 and have since rehabilitated a dam that stopped functioning in 2007 after the dam wall collapsed. Nunu Dam in Sikhathini area, which is a major source of livelihood for the community, was rehabilitated after members of the diaspora from the ward and locals came together in March last year and mobilised resources. When it was not functioning, villages lost a number of their cattle because of water challenges that were being faced in the area. Villagers used the funds to hire a contractor to rehabilitate the dam wall which was completed at the end of last year. Nunu Dam has brought hope to villagers as their animals now have a reliable water source. The community also looks forward to start various livelihood projects using water that comes from the dam. The dam is set to benefit six villages in Ward 1. The community is set to hold a ground breaking ceremony in December. Nunu Dam interim committee chairperson, Mr Dozen Moyo, who is based in South Africa, said they decided to start the project out of fear of losing all their livestock because of water challenges. <img class="wp-image-620839 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock “As members of the diaspora we engaged locals to see how best to address the problem of our animals perishing because of water challenges. We might be working outside the country as members of the diaspora but our wealth is back home in the form of livestock. We also have families and relatives back home. Our animals had to walk more than 20 kilometres to reach water points which are in other wards,” he said “Some community members sold their animals to raise funds while others had cash readily available. The dam wall collapsed 15 years ago and since then the dam had turned into a forest as it couldn’t hold water. We realised that since this dam holds water year round then we could rehabilitate it so that our animals could have a reliable water source.” Nunu Dam publicity secretary for the fundraising committee Mr Meluleki Mhlanga, who is based in Botswana, said throughout the project, local community members and those in the diaspora showed great zeal for the project to succeed. He said before the contractor could come in to construct the dam wall, members of the community cleared the bush which had grown across the dam area. “People made contributions in various segments. We managed to raise a total of R275 000.  There were contributions which came from diasporans in different parts of the world and villagers made contributions according to their village heads. The moment we started fundraising in March last year everyone was daring to go and contribute what they had to make the project a success,” he said. “All of the material which was used in repairing the dam came from contributions from the community. The other money went to hire the contractor for his services. We also put up a perimeter fence to stop cattle from climbing onto the dam wall and damaging it.” A village head from Nyabane area, Mr Mbonisi Nyathi, said rehabilitation of the dam marks a fresh start for the community. He expressed gratitude towards members of the diaspora for supporting development projects in their home area. Mr Nyathi said a number of villagers have lost their animals which have either wandered off in search of water or which have died along the way. “A number of villagers have lost their animals because of the water challenge that was being faced. Some animals have wandered off and never returned while searching for water. Some animals have succumbed to fatigue because of long distances travelled. Six villages will benefit from this dam which means a lot of animals will be saved,” he said. <img class="wp-image-634108 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-8-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-8-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-8-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> fish farming “We also hope to see various livelihood projects being introduced such as nutrition gardens, small irrigations and fish farming, which will be supported by this dam.” — @DubeMatutu.
