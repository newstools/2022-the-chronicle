A Bulawayo family from Emakhandeni suburb is stranded after losing property and national documents in a fire that gutted their home, last month. The fire broke out on July 26  at 8AM. A bed from the main bedroom, a wardrobe full of the family’s clothes, school uniforms and documents, a television set and a set of sofas were destroyed. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634165 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-21-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-21-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-21-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In an interview, the owner of the house Mr Douglas Ndhlovu (67) said it was unfortunate and saddening to see his house burnt down because he had no means of fixing it. “I am really sad my house burnt down. As you can see l am now old. l have no means of fixing the house. My daughter left me with her four children and l am the one taking care of all their expenses as we do not know where she is. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634174 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-15-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-15-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-15-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> All the property I worked hard for over the years burnt down. My concern is the documents that were destroyed and the structural damage to the house. As you can see all the asbestos in this room were destroyed. I am hoping someone will help us with fixing the roofing and the walls before the rain seasons begins,” said Mr Ndhlovu. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634177 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-20-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-20-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-20-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He told the Chronicle that the documents which burnt down belonged to him, his wife and the grandchildren. He said, “These children are still at school and their documentation is needed because it is a crime for them to not have any documents. I don’t even know where their mother is so that she can apply for their documents. l really do not know how l am going to deal with this”. His wife Ms Mary Maposa (65) said she was working at her backyard garden when the fire started. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634162 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I was working at the garden with my youngest grandson who is 18 months old when the fire started. I lost my sense of smell a long time ago so l did not smell the smoke. The neighbours called me asking what l was burning. “I immediately ran inside the house.  That is when l saw the television set was on fire. What l had not realised was that my bedroom was already on fire so l ran outside to get a bucket of water. “When l returned and I saw flames in the bedroom and l screamed for help. My neighbours took me outside and we had to wait for the fire brigade,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-18-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-18-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-18-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Maposa said the inferno reduced their belongings to ashes. “The fire destroyed everything. The sad part is we are now old and we do not have any power left within us to work so that we can regain the property we lost. As it is, we do not have clothes to put on. “Our neighbours had to donate second-hand clothes so that we could get clothing. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634171 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The rainy season is fast approaching and without a roof over our heads it will mean we will suffer. The doors were also burnt down as you can see. We are now at the mercy of thieves as we cannot lock our doors,” she said.
