UTILITY player McClive Phiri believes he can add value at ambitious Bulawayo Chiefs who have secured his services following his release by South African second-tier side, Venda Football Club. <img class="wp-image-634321 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-50.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-50.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-50-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> McClive Phiri The former Highlanders rightback first attempted to rejoin Bosso after his return from South Africa, before settling for Chiefs. Phiri was part of the 15 players offloaded by Venda at the end of the 2021/22 season. The fringe national team defender is excited with his move to Chiefs and is ready to fight for a place at the club. Phiri will have to compete for a starting place at rightback with Felix Moyo who has been a consistent performer. It is his experience and his ability to venture upfront to add numbers when his team is attacking that Phiri will bank on. “I’m happy to be back home and I’m excited to be joining Bulawayo Chiefs.  It wasn’t a hard decision (settling for Bulawayo Chiefs) to make as I felt that I can improve my career at Chiefs, learn from the coach and my teammates. I also feel that the experience I’ve got from my previous stints in the Premiership as well as in South Africa I can add value to the team and also give guidance to youngsters as a senior player,” Phiri said. Chiefs announced Phiri’s addition to the team on Monday, the day after they had submitted his registration papers with the Premier Soccer League (PSL). <img class="wp-image-634315 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-48.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-48.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-48-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> McClive Phiri The defender, who left Highlanders in 2020 to join Bidvest Wits in the South African top league, fills the gap left by Ian Nekati who has reportedly moved to India. Phiri who can also play as a right- sided midfielder had a roller-coaster affair in his career. As soon as he joined Bidvest Wits, the club sold its franchise to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and the former fringe Warriors defender was released.
He joined Sekhukhune at the beginning of the 2020/21 season. — @ZililoR
