FARMERS at Rustlers Gorge Irrigation Scheme have lost close to 2,9 hectares of winter wheat crop after elephants invaded the area. The farmers were only able to plant 2,9 hectares out of 32 hectares due to power challenges which have been affecting water supply. The elephants invaded the scheme on Tuesday night and consumed almost all the wheat crop leaving farmers in despair. The scheme has 41 farmers from six villages in Ward 19. <img class="wp-image-612009 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> irrigation schemes Recently a herd of elephants was seen near Sebasa Irrigation Scheme forcing the farmers to guard their crops. Farmers from the two schemes have called for a permanent solution to their problem as the elephants are destroying their crops. A member of Rustlers Gorge Irrigation Scheme, Mr Antonio Ncube said the elephants have invaded the scheme on several occasions and the recent one was on Tuesday. “All along a single elephant has been coming to the scheme and eating our wheat but we didn’t suffer much loss. We suffered a huge loss on Tuesday when a herd of elephants came and destroyed almost all the wheat which we had planted,” he said. <img class="wp-image-633637 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-56-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-56-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-56-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> solar grid Mr Ncube said the presence of elephants meant that their livelihoods were at risk. He said they needed an electric fence which could help to keep the elephants away. Mr Ncube said they were already struggling to produce because of power challenges and the elephants were worsening the situation. “We have been struggling to produce as we are experiencing power challenges that are making it difficult for us to get water for our crops. Our irrigation scheme is 32 hectares but we only irrigated 2,9 hectares because of water challenges. Our desire is to have a reliable water supply so that we can maximise production. That way we will be able to feed our families and also sell some of our produce,” he said. <img class="wp-image-613675 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Elephants destroying crops Gwanda District Agritex officer, Ms Zimhlophe Ndlovu said she had visited the irrigation scheme to assess the damage after receiving a report. She said almost the entire 2,9 hectares was devoured by the elephants. Ms Ndlovu said the farmers might harvest a little provided the elephants do not come back . She said an electric fence would help to keep the elephants away. Matabeleland South provincial irrigation engineer, Mr Shepherd Mpotegwa said Rustlers Gorge Irrigation Scheme was set to be rehabilitated under the Small Holder Irrigation Revitilisation Programme (SIRP). He said the project was at tendering stage. Mr Mpotegwa said works which will be done will include upgrade of the Mashaba solar grid which powers the irrigation scheme. He said the water system will also be upgraded. — @DubeMatutu
