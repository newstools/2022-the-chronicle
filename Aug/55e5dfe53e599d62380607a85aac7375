One of the most notable performances came from Boocy with her duo dance crew that was energetic and churned out the trending dances which many revellers tried to copy throughout the show. The set by the birthday girl was out of the world as she dropped hit tracks mostly by South Africa’s Busisiwa whom many align her as her lookalike.

The show ended in the wee hours of the morning leaving the formerly turned white elephant of Chicken King a go-to area every weekend.
