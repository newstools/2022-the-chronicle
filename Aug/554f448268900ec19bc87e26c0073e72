The Super Six will be used to prepare for the upcoming Sevens summer series. Saturday’s trials were the second phase of the senior selection try outs after the first one was held last week at the same venue. Fifty players availed themselves for selection. The team will however be announced on Tuesday after the final training session.  Speaking to Chronicle Sports, provincial 15s head coach Ruben Kumpasa said the reason behind delaying the announcement of the team is to see the dedication of the players. “There’s a lot of guys that come out and play, they play good rugby but they don’t come to training so we want to see how committed these guys are,” Kumpasa said. <img class="wp-image-633571 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hartsfield rugby grounds Despite missing a few players due to work commitments, Kumpasa said he was happy with the performance and is confident that when everyone comes out on Tuesday, they will have a strong team for the coming Super Six. “I am sure when everyone comes, we will have a very strong team,” said Kumpasa.
