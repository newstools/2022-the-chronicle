BARELY 48 hours after the successful hosting of the inaugural KeYona Sports football tournament, celebrated playwright Cont Mhlanga passed on. The grassroots development competition was his brainchild. Away from what is known about Mhlanga in the creative sector, there is more in his passion for sport and recreation. History has it that he was a master of karate, one passion of the martial arts he had since the 1980s, at what is now known as Amakhosi Theatre. <img class="wp-image-634150 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-35.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-35.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-35-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> KeYona TV At the time of his death, Mhlanga was working hard to put together content for the soon to be launched KeYona TV. He aimed at creating content for KeYona Sports while at the same time unleashing the raw sporting talent in the land. Mhlanga wanted to create his own sports content and was organising to do what he did with football across other sporting disciplines, according to KeYona Sports spokesperson Lee Mangena.  “Mhlanga did not only have passion for film and art, he also had a soft spot for sport. “I remember him calling me from nowhere and telling me to come see him. He outlined his vision for creating sport content for the TV station. He immediately appointed me KeYona sports spokesperson. The competition that ended on Sunday was all his idea. His vision was to have similar tournaments for other sports codes,” said Mangena. Mangena said the late arts doyen exuded a passion for sport, compared to others. He, in the arts, gave all he had to that industry. In a big way, he did the same with sport. Yes, we knew he wasn’t feeling well but we did not expect him to leave us now. He had asked me to start something to celebrate Ali Baba’s birthday. “He had said once we are done with the tournament we will start organising. Like a father, a grandfather and more than just a boss.” Mhlanga established Amakhosi Theatre in 1981 where a number of artistes who passed through his hands became household names in Zimbabwe. It started as a youth karate club called Dragons in 1979 and turned into Amakhosi Theatre two years later. <img class="wp-image-624685 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-50.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-50.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-50-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ndabezinhle Mazibuko Bulawayo Metropolitan Karate Association (BMKA) chairperson Ndabezinhle Mazibuko said: “It’s unfortunate that we lost one of the pioneers of the game of karate. l first got to know about karate through these guys when we heard word about their club in the neighbourhood. “Though the club later turned into an art hub one can not take away the immense contribution the club made for karate in those two years.” For Mhlanga, his KeYona Television project, is meant to solidify the city of Bulawayo as the arts and cultural capital of Zimbabwe while creating employment opportunities especially for the youths across the divide. — @innocentskizoe
