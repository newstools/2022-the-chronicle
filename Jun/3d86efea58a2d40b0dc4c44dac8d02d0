THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) says one of the people leasing the Ascot Racecourse is in the process of setting up a sports field, which is undergoing greening. <img class="wp-image-589407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council Ascot Racecourse was once a famous horse racing course but it was forced to shut down in 2001 as the sport declined in popularity in the region. Chronicle Sport observed that a section of the derelict racecourse is fenced and the land is being worked on. Council did not reveal who is leasing the land but confirmed that a sports field is being constructed. <img class="wp-image-616711 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-242.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-242.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-242-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ascot Racecourse (Photo credit: Alamy) “Since the discontinuation of racing by Matabeleland Turf Club at Ascot Racecourse, there have been various leases running for renewable lease periods ranging from two to five years. One of the leases is running a training ground for sports, which is undergoing greening,” BCC said in response to a Chronicle Sport inquiry.  “All leases are subject to a termination clause allowing council to assume possession of the land should it be required for any purpose, provided a six months’ notice period is given. It is worthwhile noting that Ascot Race Course has been put on Expression of Interest for redevelopment. “After the Expression of Interest, detailed proposals shall be required leading to the actual redevelopment. In view of the foregoing, appropriate action would be taken as and when required regarding the current leases,” council said. It was reported in 2020 that BCC failed to attract potential investors to redevelop Ascot Racecourse, which has been neglected for about two decades. Part of the racecourse was subject to a Government investigation a few years ago after the local authority sold some land to the then deputy mayor Gift Banda in what residents claimed was for a paltry amount. According to council, Ascot Racecourse is a zoned residential and ancillary in terms of local plan number five which covers the area. It is located in the vicinity of upmarket suburbs like Woodlands, Suburbs and Kumalo. The site measures 59,8 hectares. The closure of Ascot Racecourse left Borrowdale Race Course in Harare as the only venue for live horse racing in the country. — @innocentskizoe
