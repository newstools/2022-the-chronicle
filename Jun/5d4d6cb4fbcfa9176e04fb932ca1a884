According to the list of suspended players that was provided by the PSL, Nyabinde was suspended for the game against Bulawayo City,” said Moyo.  Black Rhinos coach Herbert Maruwa could not be drawn to comment on allegations that they used a suspended player. He only said the player had actually followed the rest of the team to Bulawayo after being cleared by the PSL. <img class="wp-image-555422 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Kudzai-Bare.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Kudzai-Bare.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Kudzai-Bare-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> PSL communications and media liaison officer Kudzai Bare PSL communications and media liaison officer Kudzai Bare said they were looking into the matter. Meanwhile, City are now unbeaten in four matches since Farai Tawachera replaced Philani “Beefy” Ncube as head coach last month. They have collected six points from three matches but remain second from bottom on the league table with 12 points from 17 matches. The municipal side is fighting relegation and that battle appears to be on course since the coming on board of Tawachera and Dalubuhle Bhebhe as his assistant. — @innocentskizoe
