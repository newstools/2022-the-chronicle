On the 30th of May 2022 at around 1900hrs, the brother of the now deceased came back home and found the deceased’s body lying on the ground with a rope around his neck. Another piece of the rope was tied on the roof truss. “The deceased left a suicide note that stated that he has failed the school system and the system has failed him. “The informant made a report at ZRP Magwegwe and the body was conveyed to the mortuary,” said Inspector Ncube. He urged members of the public to share their problems with others or to approach local counsellors, church leaders and other relevant personnel as committing suicide is not a solution to any problem.- @bonganinkunzi.
