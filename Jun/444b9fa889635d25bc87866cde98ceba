The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent The mining city of Kwekwe will be a hive of activity this weekend as a number of entertainment activities are lined up. The main attraction will be the Annual Winter Fun Colour Run which is being hosted by King Solomon’s Hotel. The event, the first of its kind in Kwekwe, will see participants taking part in 5km and 10km races. Solomon’s Lifestyle Café manager Shepard Mupfudze said the event will start at 7am and seeks to raise funds for charity. “All is in place for the event. Upon payment, each participant will receive a free t-shirt with all the proceeds set to be channeled towards charity,” said Mupfudze. He said they will identify a school in Kwekwe which needs help in terms of water and sanitation or any other area where the donations will be channeled to. Across town, there is going to be a cake fair at Prince Park in the CBD where cake bakers are expected to exhibit their confectioneries. Organised by Karowaz Media Company, the event is meant to empower youths and young women who are into the baking business. “This will be an open platform to expose their businesses to the general public and business partners. Cakes will be purchased on-site and there will be prizes to be won,” said Naison Makumba. DJ Brian, MC Hazel and gospel artiste Spencer Mugoni are expected to serenade fans. Later in the evening, high-riding dancehall artiste Enzo Ishall will be at Club Levue for an Utra-Black Party. The lyrical genius will be supported by DJs Masterpiece, Yassa, Dreezy, Beezy and Stallion Gangster. At The Club at Mbizo 4 Shopping Centre, Kapfupi and forgotten Jacob Moyana of the Munotidako firm are expected to entertain fans. The Club is proving to be the place to be for entertainment lovers after recently playing host to Nicholas Zacharia, raunchy dancer Zoey and lately chanter Etherton B.
