ZIMBABWE international Teenage Hadebe made his 12th appearance for Houston Dynamo in the 2022 Major League Soccer (MLS) season, helping his side end a three-match losing streak as they beat Chicago Fire 2-0 on Sunday. The 26-year-old defender is in his second season in America’s topflight league, having made 17 MLS in his debut season.  On Sunday, Hadebe played the entire match as Dynamo finally remembered how to win since their last 3-0 victory at LA Galaxy on May 23. The result was followed by a 2-1 US Open Cup defeat to Sporting KC, MLS defeats to Real Salt Lake (3-0) and Orlando City (2-1). Hadebe missed the US Open Cup defeat to Sporting KC, but returned to feature in his team’s MLS encounters.
Dynamo’s victory against Chicago Fire left them glued in eighth place with 21 points from 16 games on the Western Conference table. <img class="wp-image-621925 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lucky Mkosana Meanwhile, ex-Warriors forward Lucky Mkosana rose from the bench to score a 64th minute goal for Tampa Bay Rowdies in their 5-2 USL Championship match against Pittsburgh Riverhounds on Sunday.
