WELL-WISHERS who have been touched by the story of the Nkayi family which lost 21 cattle after dozing them with a deadly grain protectant have mobilised donations including cattle to be handed over to the family today. The cattle, which were said to be valued at over US$8 500 died after being given the dose following a breakdown in communication over the use of the chemical. The cattle were on Sunday last week given a tablet each of aluminum phosphide, which is used for fumigating stored grain, seeds and tobacco among others.  The cattle belong to three Mpofu family members, Mr Lindani Mpofu, who bought the pesticide; Mr Orderly Mpofu, who dosed the cattle and 99-year-old Mrs Jennet Mpofu. The family homestead is at Dolahali area in Nhlekisa Village under village head Ncube. The family has been sleeping together to guard against those who may want to commit suicide due to the impact of the loss. A member of the organising committee that has been tasked to co-ordinate the donation, Mr Atwell Mahlangu said they have been using social media to mobilise support after being touched by the story. “We have people from all over who have been touched by the tragedy that befell the Mpofu family and we have been mobilising to see how best we can assist them,” he said. “I am not in a position to state the number of cattle that we have raised as of now but come tomorrow, we will be in a clear position. Some have donated cash, cattle feed and vaccines among others.” <img class="size-full wp-image-619885" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The poison that killed the 21 cattle Mr Mahlangu said a number of organisations and businesses have come on board with various donations. He said some cattle are coming from outside Bulawayo and processes were afoot to clear them and send them to Nkayi. “People read the story and were touched by the incident and we thought of doing something. We have a WhatsApp group that focuses on farming issues where we have been mobilising assistance for the family,” said Mr Mahlangu. “We are trying to clear the donations and once all is done, we will hand over the donations to the family and send them to Nkayi.” A family member, Mrs Sakhiwe Moyo told the Chronicle yesterday that they have been told to prepare their kraal. “A veterinary officer visited us on Monday and asked us to prepare our kraal. He said kulokuncane abangakuletha kusasa (something small they might bring tomorrow). He said they are sorting out some things before they come,” she said. It is said that one of the family members bought grain preserving pesticide and gave it to a teenage boy to take it home. The young man forgot the message and when he got home, he said the contents were for dosing cattle. Only one ox survived after the family was advised to make it drink opaque beer and a heifer which is expecting and was not given the dose and two calves. The cattle were buried after advice against burning them by the veterinary officer in the district. — @themkhust
