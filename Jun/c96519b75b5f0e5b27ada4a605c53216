The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Reporter Father’s Day usually passes without that much pomp and fanfare, but there are people who want to change this as they go all out in celebrating them this year. This Sunday at the Barn in Bulawayo, there will be a Dad’s Brunch Club food and braai fest. Entertainment will be provided by the Outfit Band and there will be a free car wash, grooming stalls and doctors to give fathers health check-ups.  Also, there will be back and neck massages for fathers. Organiser of the celebrations, Mduduzi Mdlongwa of 3D Events said they want to pamper fathers on their special day. “Fathers have been working very hard over the years and some feel underappreciated. We want to change that with this event for them as there are people who we want to say thank you. They carry a lot of burdens on their shoulders and on Sunday we want them to loosen up and relax the whole day,” said Mdlongwa. He said the event will start at 8AM and end at 6PM. Mdlongwa said it will not be a day out alone for fathers, as those who want can bring their wives and children to the event. “There will be a kids zone on site that has jumping castles and child monitors to keep an eye on the kids while the parents or fathers enjoy their day,” said Mdlongwa. The first Father’s Day was celebrated on June 19, 1910. The holiday was later moved to the third Sunday in June. Father’s Day is a holiday of honouring fatherhood and paternal bonds, as well as the influence of fathers in society. – @bonganinkunzi
