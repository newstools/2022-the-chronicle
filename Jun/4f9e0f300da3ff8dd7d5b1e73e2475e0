BULAWAYO City Council’s (BCC) failure to manage its properties has been exposed as 90 percent of houses reserved for security guards are being leased out by former employees for personal financial gain. <img class="wp-image-589407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council The local authority says from 142 houses that are reserved for security guards, only 15 are still occupied by council employees under the Bulawayo Municipal Council (BMC) Security Council Compound. The lease holders are reportedly paying a ridiculously low $35 in monthly rentals. This is contained in the latest council report that was released last Wednesday. The local authority has resolved to evict non-council employees from the premises. According to the report, director of Housing and Community Services Mr Dictor Khumalo said council used to provide accommodation to municipal security personnel on a month-to-month rental. He said shifting the security administration from the Engineering Service Department to Chamber Secretary’s Department created administrative challenges, resulting in officers who had left council not vacating the premises. “When the Security Section was moved to Chamber Secretary’s Department the system of tied accommodation eventually collapsed. The retired personnel were no longer given three months’ notice to vacate the premises. They then remained there with their families who were non-council employees or sub-letted the premises prejudicing serving members of the security guards,” said Mr Khumalo.  “Currently, there were only fifteen units that were currently occupied by council staff members out of 142 units. Rentals were as low as $35 because of the recognition of the fact that it’s a tied accommodation. However, 90 percent of the tenants were non-council employees.” He said this indicates that council resources are being squandered by undeserving families. Mr Khumalo said subletting of council properties is being done by retired employees and it violates the council’s by-laws. He said some tenants have turned the housing units into brothels that were congested, resulting in high cost of maintenance. Mr Khumalo proposed that the council must remove non-council employees from the said houses and the suggestion has since been adopted by council. “Non-staff occupants be given three months’ notice to find alternative accommodation and vacate the rooms. The BMC units are allocated to serving uniformed members of council these being Bulawayo Municipality Police and Rangers. Administration of the units be done by Director of Housing and Community Services (Mzilikazi Housing Office) who shall maintain a register of staff in the relevant sections in need of accommodation,” said Mr Khumalo. According to the report, Ward 5 councillor Felix Mhaka among other councillors called on the local authority to come up with a clear policy on its council-tied accommodation for staff members. “Alderwoman Monica Lubimbi supported the report. She felt that council workers, especially lower grades, had no accommodation. Most Council workers could not afford to purchase residential stands. The Deputy Mayor (Councillor Mlandu Ncube) supported the report. <img class="wp-image-615034 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-14-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-14-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-14-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Deputy Mayor (Councillor Mlandu Ncube) He emphasised the need to review the council’s conditions of lease for tied accommodation,” reads the report. “Council staff members in tied accommodation must be reminded that accommodation was only provided for during the employment period. After registration, death and retirement tied-accommodation lease expired.” Meanwhile, council has expressed concern that the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services have not vacated Thokozani Flats despite the correctional service’s lease with the local authority having expired. The local authority said it allocated land to ZPCS to construct homes for its workers but this has not happened. “It had been agreed that a time table of moving out be submitted to Council. Up to now the timetable had not been availed. A court order was issued in favour of council but had been held in abeyance at the request of ZPCS. ZPCS was given land to construct residential flats for its officers and staff and up to now no development had taken place and they had not made good on their promises. Council would re-engage,” reads the report. – @nqotshili
