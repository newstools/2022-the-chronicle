Milner, who made his Premier League debut for Leeds in 2002, has played at full-back and in midfield under Klopp,
“I’m very pleased to be staying for another season,” he told Liverpoolfc.com. “I have never taken playing for this club for granted and I never will. “An overriding feeling for me – and a vitally important one in the process – was the belief I can still contribute to the team. The gaffer was clear what he thought and that was a big factor in me extending my contract.” He added: “Last season was extraordinary, even though it didn’t have the ending we hoped it would. But I think that will only make us all even hungrier for more success.” <img class="wp-image-594763 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/salah-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/salah-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/salah-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mohamed Salah Five Liverpool players – Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – are about to enter the final 12 months of their existing contracts.
