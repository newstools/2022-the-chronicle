The Zifa Northern Region chairman Martin Kweza said it had learnt with deep shock about the tragic passing away of Mushunje.  “Mushunje’s death has not only robbed Simba Bhora of one of their star players, as his tragic passing has also left the league in particular and the Zimbabwean game in general poorer. What makes it even more painful is that Mushunje met his cruel fate while returning to Shamva after attending the burial of a late relative in Mutare,” said Kweza. “He had up to the time of his death been one of the stand-out players in the first-half of the 2021/22 season. He had won two Man of the Match awards during the Axis Solutions Super 8 Cup and with as many goals and assists both in league matches and the Axis Solutions Super 8 Cup. <img class="size-full wp-image-588911" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/soccer-ball-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/soccer-ball-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/soccer-ball-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Foot ball – Image taken from Getty Images “This attests to the dream season that Barnabas was having.
