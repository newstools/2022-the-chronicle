The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Hwange
COMMUNITIES living near game parks in Matabeleland North have appealed to Government to set up a welfare fund to compensate victims of human-wildlife conflict and for villagers to benefit from natural resources near them. Matabeleland North is endowed with vast natural resources including minerals and wildlife but communities have complained that they do not directly benefit from them. Those adjacent to Hwange National Park have lost livestock, crops and property while some people have been killed by marauding animals. <img class="wp-image-615718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock Some have lost herds of livestock while others have been killed and properties destroyed. People spend nights guarding crops in the fields and livestock in pens, and cannot freely move around because of prevalence of animals. Affected villagers told Parliament’s Thematic Commitee on Peace and Security that is visiting victims of human-wildlife conflict in Hwange that they want protection, compensation and to benefit from wild animals, as well as a retention of a percentage of proceeds realised from local resources, including the Victoria Falls. The committee, led by Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) visited Sikabela resettlement area in Matetsi ward and Mabale, both under Hwange Rural District on Wednesday. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615711 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We are told the animals belong to us all but we have never been compensated for the loss of livestock, crops and relatives killed by animals. The Bible says man shall have rule over animals but the status quo suggests otherwise. “People have lost tonnes of grains and livestock to these animals without compensation. The whites who used to occupy these farms were being given quotas to hunt wild animals including lions which are now too many but since we came here in 2000 we have never been given any. I speak with a heavy heart because I am a victim and wish there could be a fund for victims,” said Alderman Elias Muzamba, a farmer in Matetsi ward 1. Another resettled farmer Mr Juma Mpala said:
“We never knew we would suffer like this. We even fought the war for this heritage but it is making us suffer. It’s true that ilifa lezithutha lidliwa yizihlakaniphi because we are being made to suffer yet our resources are taken away.” Mr Christopher Soweto Ndlovu said safari and tour operators in Hwange must be compelled to plough back to the community. “Our appeal is for people to get a share of resources harvested here and whoever that invests or hunts should plough back to the community because we are the most affected. “We appeal to Government to establish a fund through ZimParks to take care of families of people killed by animals and compensate those that have lost cattle and livestock,” said Mr Ndlovu. He said local communities should also be prioritised in hunting quotas. Lupote village head Mrs Anna Dube said once established, the fund will help develop social amenities in the community. “We have no schools and proper water sources yet we have animals that trouble us daily. These animals are not helping us but destroying all we have. It is our wish that a fund should be set aside to develop our area,” she said. Mr Sikhumbuzo Nkala of Nsongwa said locals should be given hunting quotas so that they sell animals or share meat.  The visit is aimed at creating a platform for interaction between legislators and victims of human-wildlife conflict. In the absence of a compensation mechanism, Hwange RDC chief executive Mr Phindile Ncube said the local authority had assisted families of victims of human-wildlife conflict especially with funeral expenses. ZimParks spokesperson Mr Tinashe Farawo said: “The reason why we are here is for Senators to appreciate the challenges that our communities are going through so that they can be helped. “We must be seen to be doing something to help our people as leadership so that they benefit from resources that we have. The Senators will speak to victims because communities want compensation for lost lives and livestock and we want the communities to speak for themselves.” The acting chairperson of the committee Senator Themba Mathuthu of Umzingwane Constituency in Matabeleland South said a report will be prepared and presented to Parliament for debate. “We are here for the first time to visit affected areas with reference to human-wildlife conflict. We want to hear from the victims and take note of their concerns,” said Sen Mathuthu. An African Elephant conference was held in Hwange recently where nations affected by human-wildlife conflict are seeking a common position on wildlife management especially regarding the ever increasing elephant population. -@ncubeleon
