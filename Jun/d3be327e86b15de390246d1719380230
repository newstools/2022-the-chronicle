Today, the world will celebrate International Gin Day and hordes of local gin lovers are set to converge at the Hillside Dams’ Tea Room for the celebrations. International Gin Day is a global celebration of all things gin. It is observed annually on the second Saturday in June. <img class="alignnone wp-image-616285 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-181.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-181.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-181-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> According to different media sources, the history of International Gin dates back to 2009, following the efforts of an avid gin connoisseur, Neil Houston. Already a massive fan of gin, he wanted to find a way to bring the drink to more people so that they could enjoy it. At the time, it looked as if other spirits might supersede gin. <img class="wp-image-616482 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-208.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-208.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-208-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bheki Ncube So he and the “Gin Monkey” Emma Stokes, teamed up to launch the first World Gin Day in Birmingham, England as a way to popularise a gin bar. Speaking to Saturday Leisure, Comrades Beverages spokesperson Bheki Ncube said the celebrations are meant to unite local gin lovers.  “The idea is to have people come and have a taste of handcrafted gins from different countries in Southern Africa. Seeing that the establishment of gin brands is an in-thing nowadays, the plan to host International Gin Day celebrations makes perfect sense. “The event is a first of its kind in Zimbabwe and will set precedence in the local gin sector,” he said. At the event, gin lovers are set to taste handcrafted gins including Shelela from Eswatini, Watermark and Forgotten Tribe from South Africa while Zimbabwe will be represented by Matobo Gin. <img class="wp-image-616291 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-182.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-182.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-182-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matobo Gin Besides the free craft gin tasting, the event will serve as a launch pad for Matravela (real name Mthabisi Khumalo) and Meat Master. Locally-based Meat Master is an expert in braaing smoked chicken and beef at events whereas Matravela will be showcasing his camping gear. Gin lovers will also enjoy free bonfire snacks courtesy of the aforementioned companies as well as live music from Jam Session. – @eMKlass_49.
