The Chronicle DEBUTANT teenager Noor Ahmad was the four-wicket star as Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe by 35 runs at Harare Sports Club yesterday to complete a 3-0 T20I series win. One of four changes to the team that won on Sunday, the 18-year-old left-arm wrist-spinner took a remarkable 4/10 in a four-over spell, which helped restrict Zimbabwe to 90 for 9 in their 20 overs as they chased Afghanistan’s 125-8. <img class="wp-image-617449 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clive Madande Sharafuddin Ashraf, a slow, left-arm orthodox bowler, took two wickets as the tourists completed a white-ball tour sweep having already won all three games in the one-day international series between the sides. After winning the toss and choosing to bat, captain Mohammad Nabi top-scored with 31 for Afghanistan in the dead rubber.  Batting at number 6, the all-rounder scored at a run a ball and struck two fours. Nabi was caught by rival skipper Craig Ervine at extra cover off the bowling of Luke Jongwe from the final ball of the 18th over when he sliced a full, wide delivery. <img class="wp-image-617446 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Luke Jongwe Najibullah Zadran, tormentor in chief of Zimbabwe in the previous T20I triumphs with innings of 44 and 57, lasted only four balls before being caught by debutant wicketkeeper Clive Madande off a Ryan Burl googly.
