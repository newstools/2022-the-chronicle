In a prior interview, Asaph told Chronicle Showbiz how his work ethic got him the coveted contract. “I performed at the Shutdown Bulawayo gig back in 2019 and there were scouts from Universal Music who were watching the performances. I later discovered that I’d been on their radar since I released Mambo and Vibe is Correct so when they saw my set, they were impressed. That’s when the talks started,” said Asaph.
