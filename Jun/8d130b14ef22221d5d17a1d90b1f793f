Interestingly, five clubs, Dynamos, Tenax CPS United, Whawha and Bulawayo City, failed to score at home, with log leaders Chicken Inn posting the biggest win of the weekend. Whawha FC, have proved to be the most porous side as they have let in a massive 35 goals, scoring 15 to leave them with a worrying goal difference of -20. They anchor the table with 12 points. Bearing the magical number 10 jersey, the stocky and pacey Muza has been on fire, leading his team to the summit of the PSL table. Muza was on target when Chicken Inn clobbered Cranborne Bullets 4-1 to take his goal tally to 10.  His goals are 38 percent of  Chicken Inn’s total of 26 goals this season, with midfielder Bret Amidu, who found his fifth goal in their previous encounter, coming close to chasing him. “I’m happy to have scored my 10th goal of the season. I’m happy to have reached double figures. I thank God for that and I pray I get to the end of the season in this fine goal scoring form. Credit goes to my teammates and the members of our technical department. I will not put myself under pressure, but my target is to keep on scoring for the club,” said Muza. Caps United’s William Manondo and Manica Diamonds’ Nyasha Chintuli are keeping a close check on Muza and are tied on nine goals. Muza, Manondo and Chintuli will play the next 16 rounds of matches seeking to outdo each other for the 2021/2022 Golden Boot Award.
