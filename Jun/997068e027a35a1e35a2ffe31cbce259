BULAWAYO City coach Farai Tawachera says his players and technical team are still in the process of recovering from a stomach bug that hit their camp when they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Ngezi Platinum Stars on Saturday. City were hammered 0-3 by Ngezi, but Tawachera said three quarters of his squad complained of stomach pains and diarrhoea symptoms for the duration of the game. City said they had done well to play through the pain in the first-half, but the situation escalated for them in the second-half, and they conceded all three goals then. <img class="wp-image-607530 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Farai Tawachera “We have started training and things are getting back to normal. I think the boys are recovering well. I am sure we will get better with time and play a fully-fit side on Sunday. It is unfortunate that almost everyone in the side started complaining about stomach pains during the game. Even I and others on the technical bench were struggling. We are yet to get the doctor’s report on what really happened, but it could be something we ate,” said Tawachera. Club communications and media officer Thandiwe Moyo said: “Our health personnel are dealing with that. We will be getting a report soon.” <img class="wp-image-622474 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sakubva Stadium City remained languishing second from the bottom of the league table with just 12 points.  The defeat by Ngezi was Tawachera’s first defeat since assuming the head coach’s role at the municipal outfit. He had overseen four games, winning once and managing three stalemates. City face Manica Diamonds in their next game at Sakubva Stadium in Mutare. Manica Diamonds are fourth on the league table and City will have to be at their level best if they are to get anything from that game. — @innocentskizoe
