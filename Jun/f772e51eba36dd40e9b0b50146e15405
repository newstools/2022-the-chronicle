The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter A year after being involved in an ugly road rage incident, former Warriors’ midfielder Willard Katsande will count himself lucky to have survived a hijacking the Southgate Mall in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Tuesday. Katsande told the media that the incident made him lose business and personal property worth thousands of rand, including his cellphone plus cash which were in the car at the time. The 36-year-old has been hard at work building his business profile, which includes construction and his popular clothing line Boss Ya Mboka Kitoko Makasi “I’m traumatised right now because of my previous road rage experience,” Katsande told KickOff. “I have been left with bruises because the three guys who hijacked me in the parking lot at Southgate Mall dragged me on the ground.” Katsande’s vehicle was later recovered in Eldorado Park by a tracking company with extensive damage – @innocentskizoe
