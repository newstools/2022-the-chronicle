We want people to get inspired to start their own businesses. We want people who’re responsible to come together and share skills as well as ideas on how to work together and build and develop our country,” he said. “The second edition was inspired by the patrons themselves who actually asked for more. We decided to heed their call and also give those who missed the first edition an opportunity to be part of the event. <img class="alignnone wp-image-619648 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Zvishavane-Hustlers-Party-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Zvishavane-Hustlers-Party-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Zvishavane-Hustlers-Party-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Fans should expect fun and networking on a Friday night,” said Murehwa.
