Roasting her shows that she’s tough and can take it, heralding a new breed of women who aren’t afraid to face hurdles head-on and take their place in the upper echelons of our local entertainment sector. “We’re planning to roast politicians, elite business people as well as sports personalities and other celebrated people moving forward. This will show that diversity is achievable locally and that we can deliver more than stand-up comedy. It’ll surely be a rib-cracking event,” Van Moyo said. He believes the roast will be timely since it will coincide with the roast of South African media personality and actress Khanyi Mbau by Comedy Central Africa. <img class="wp-image-619513 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-26-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-26-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-26-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khanyi Mbau Novuyo Seagirl is set to make national history and become the first female roastee in Zimbabwe.
