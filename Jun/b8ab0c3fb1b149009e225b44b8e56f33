So far, we’ve played some of the singles from the album during our shows and people liked them. “At the launch, we’ll raise the bar high so that we make people fall in love with our jams,” said DJ Drumz. Said ZagoeRadge: “I hope that Zimbabweans will appreciate this album because it’s original. It’s actually an album that accommodates ‘ama2000’ and the elderly.” – @mthabisi_mthire
