FORMER Warriors’ captain Danny “Deco” Phiri says he is hunting for a local club to join after recovering from a knee injury which got worse during his brief stint with Tanzanian side Diamond Trust Bank. <img class="wp-image-616743 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-249.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-249.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-249-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Knee injury Phiri (33) returned to Zimbabwe early this year to give himself time to recover from the knee injury. “The truth of the matter is that I’m looking for a club that I can play for anywhere in the country.  I have been doing individual training for a number of weeks now and my wish is to start training with a local club with the aim of returning to full action. I’m happy that I’m fit again after my knee injury that got worse in Tanzania. I believe my legs can still carry me,” said Phiri. <img class="wp-image-616744 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-250.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-250.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-250-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> South African Premier Soccer League The gritty midfielder was previously in the books of Chicken Inn before he joined South African Premier Soccer League outfit Golden Arrows in 2016 where he played 97 games across all competitions in his defensive midfield role. He suffered a career-threatening knee injury in the 2020/21 season and doctors told him he would not play football again, but he bounced back after five months on the sidelines and did duty for Golden Arrows. He left the KwaZulu Natal-based club together with ex-Warriors’ imposing goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda and found a home at Tanzanian second tier league side Diamond Trust Bank. While his handlers still believe that Phiri still has what it takes to play at the top level, sources told Chronicle Sport that he is one of many candidates earmarked for the role of junior teams’ manager at Chicken Inn. “Chicken Inn has always been my home but I haven’t talked to anyone to that effect. I’m only considering starting training with any club to work on my fitness levels,” Phiri said. – @FungaiMuderere
