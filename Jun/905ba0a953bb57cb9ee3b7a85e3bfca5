THE Ntepe-Manama Community Radio Trust is inching closer to going on air as renovation work to turn a section of Manama Bible School into a broadcasting studio is nearing completion. <img class="wp-image-619582 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-295.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-295.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-295-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) The trust was last year given a list of recommendations by Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) engineers to turn a section of the Manama Bible School into a studio before equipment could be handed over to them. Part of the work included putting up soundproof walls, aluminum doors as well as installing a high traffic carpet and a broadcasting desk. These have all been installed with minor touch ups remaining in order for the studio to begin broadcasting. The Community Radio Trust still has to purchase office furniture, pave the outside so that dust doesn’t get into the studio as well as secure the place. They also have to put up signage from Gwanda up to Manama giving directions to the studio as well as branding of the building.  Speaking after inspection of the station premises in Manama on Friday, BAZ technical engineer Mr Brian Mangena said he was impressed with the progress made by the community radio trust so far. “We’re here at Manama to do our regular inspections as BAZ. We’ve been working with the Ntepe-Manama community since the start of this community radio project and I must say we’re impressed with the work they have done,” he said. “When we started this project, we defined the scope of work, which was supposed to be done and the responsibility matrix where the Ntepe-Manama community was supposed to do certain works before BAZ came in to provide equipment, training, consultancy and any other support. “We’re happy with what we’re seeing and Ntepe-Manama is probably at 95 percent of the work we said they must do,” said Mr Mangena. He said once the remaining touch ups are done, equipment would be installed in the studio. “It is feasible to meet the September deadline since most of the work that Ntepe-Manama Community Radio was supposed to do is already done. We’re going to chip in with the support that we promised. “We want to make sure that everything is in place so that we install the equipment in a clean environment. No other major works are supposed to be done after the installation of equipment,” said Mr Mangena. <img class="wp-image-619585 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-296.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-296.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-296-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Radio studio Ntepe-Manama Community Radio Trust board chairman Mr Nyakallo Makhurane said the community radio would promote the SeSotho language and the culture of the Babirwa people. “We’re excited to have completed Studio 1 where our broadcasting equipment will be installed. “We, however, still have a few things to complete and will go back to the community where each individual has been contributing $1 per year towards this project,” said Mr Makhurane. He said the community had no access to local radio stations and were forced to listen to content from South Africa and Botswana. “If you wanted to listen to a local radio station, you needed to climb up a mountain to try and tap into the signal. “We’re happy that this will be a thing of the past as Government has stepped in to ensure that we have a local radio station,” said Mr Makhurane. — @Yolisswa
