Two wires and three screws were inserted in his foot and he had been given up to February for doctors to tell whether he will be able to play again. Posting on his Facebook page, Nyoni announced that 14 months of specialist and rehabilitation treatment had yielded no positive results. <img class="wp-image-602524 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KELVIN-KAUD.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KELVIN-KAUD.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KELVIN-KAUD-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kelvin Kaindu “I have officially retired from football. 14 months of specialist and rehabilitation treatment hasn’t yielded the expected result. I tried my best. I appreciate all the support you gave me during my football career. “Highlanders fans you are special, always family. Caps United fans, you welcomed me like your own. Maritzburg United you gave me a better chance in life. Cape United you took great care of me. Thank you so much. The advice you gave me during my soccer career, please do continuously give me in business,” wrote Nyoni. <img class="wp-image-622261 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bongani Mafu He also took an opportunity to thank a few individuals that have had an influence in his footballing career and these include former Highlanders coaches Kelvin Kaindu, Bongani Mafu and Madinda Ndlovu, former Highlanders chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube, Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe and Caps United owner Farai Jere, among others.  Nyoni joined Cape Umoya in September 2020 from Maritzburg United where he had signed a two-year contract with the option of a 12-month extension, but constant injury lay-offs resulted in him being offloaded. He had joined Maritzburg United at the beginning of the 2019/2020 season from Caps United with high expectations. He had signed for Caps after doing duty at Highlanders for six years from 2012.
