IDENTIFICATION of beneficiaries for the Government’s harmonised cash transfer programme is underway in Matabeleland South province. The programme is a relief intervention by Government whereby vulnerable households are paid cash every month. It was suspended in some districts following a bumper harvest during the 2020/21 farming season. Matabeleland South provincial social welfare officer, Mr Criswell Nyakudya said identification of beneficiaries was underway in Gwanda and Umzingwane districts.  He said Mangwe and Bulilima districts were already benefiting from the programme. “We are doing a re-targeting and registration exercise for beneficiaries of the harmonised cash transfer programme. The exercise is underway in Gwanda and Umzingwane districts. The programme is being re-introduced because of the increase in vulnerable households. In Gwanda social development officers have been moving around and registering beneficiaries. We are now at the verification stage,” he said. Mr Nyakudya said in Umzingwane the exercise had just started and officers are on the ground identifying beneficiaries. “This programme is targeting rural wards. <img class="alignnone wp-image-620821 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The beneficiaries comprise the elderly, persons with disability, child headed families, the chronically ill and food insecure households. The number of vulnerable households has increased significantly in the province following a poor harvest this year,” he said. Mr Nyakudya said the list of beneficiaries will be submitted to their Head Office for approval after which beneficiaries start receiving the cash. The registration of vulnerable households follows traditional leaders’ appeals for Government intervention to assist the food insecure households following poor harvest in most parts of the province. Chief Masendu from Bulilima District said almost all households within his area are in need of help. “Assistance is needed from Government and other partners because most households didn’t harvest this year. The rains let us down this year hence the poor harvest. Many people were hopeful this year following a good season last year,” he said. Chief Bango from Mangwe district said it was a relief that Government is assisting vulnerable households. He said even families with relatives working in Botswana and South Africa were struggling. <img class="wp-image-614584 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 Chief Bango said effects of the Covid-19 coupled with poor harvest had left many families in dire need of assistance. –@DubeMatutu
