The homeless, mostly children living on the streets, say the prevailing cold spell has been unfriendly to them most as other people have the option of hiding indoors. <img class="wp-image-615474 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-74.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-74.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-74-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Street kids sit on the pavement between George Silundika Street and Robert Mugabe Way in Bulawayo yesterday Some of those living on the streets, both young and old do not have blankets. Among them are those who ran away from home for one reason or another. Some say they are victims of circumstances and under normal circumstances they would not have picked that path.
Catching up with them, they told Chronicle that this weather is unfriendly to the homeless. According to the Meteorological Services Department, Bulawayo has been recording average minimum temperatures of nine degrees Celsius. Mr Kundai Mhandu (34) who lives on the streets around Bulawayo Main Railway Station said he makes a small fire to keep him warm before he sleeps. His temporary night shelter is made up of cardboard boxes. “I have never experienced such cold in my life. I have been on the streets for about five years, but this year the cold is worse. I have one blanket which is getting old and is no longer that warm. The weather is just for people with homes, it is not friendly for us who are on the streets,” he said. Mr Ndlovu said he came from Mberengwa, Midlands Province, but he cannot go back home for reasons that he preferred not to share. A number of boys between the ages of 11 to 15 years said they do not have a permanent spot but they usually “chill” along 9th Avenue between George Silundika and Robert Mugabe streets. “During winter or any other cold day, we look for a warmer corner just to sleep. We do not have a permanent spot yet; we are still looking for the safest. From morning to evening we will be moving around bins to look for food and we find it. Food is no longer a main problem here in the streets, but the cold. We are wearing torn clothes, we do not have jerseys, and as a group of almost 10 we share one blanket.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615466" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-73.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-73.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-73-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> With that one blanket we take turns at night, once the first ones fall asleep others take the blanket and try falling asleep as well,” one of the boys said. “When it’s very cold like Monday, we find means of sharing that one blanket. It’s not easy at all. We used to have about three to four blankets, but the problem is that older people who also live on the streets steal from us. We have to move around looking for food while carrying all our property.” A group of 18 boys who live opposite the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) grounds said they have found “new families” on the streets. They also hustle as a group to source clothes and blankets. Mr Methuseli Ndlovu (19) said in the evening they “take” tyres that are used by driving schools that conduct lessons nearby to make a fire that has proven to be their main source of warmth since they do not have blankets. “My family does not consist of thieves. The problem is that when people see us, they see violent people who just want to steal their things, but we do not do that, we ask nicely.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615475" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-75.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-75.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-75-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> All the things we have were willingly given to us by people who felt our need. They have given us clothes but they are not enough for this cold. The fire keeps us warm. If only someone could donate firewood and nothing else, we would still appreciate it,” he said. Another boy who only identified himself only as Courage (24) appealed to well-wishers to buy them second hand clothes. “We are begging for someone to just buy us one cheap jacket each. We also need takkies or even socks to keep our feet warm. This weather will kill us,” he said. A 16-year-old boy, who is recovering from severe burns on his hands, said in addition to the weather, they also have a problem with local authority rangers who chase them away. “I got burnt when the rangers came out of the blue and burnt a tent which I was sleeping in without warning. They tell us to go to Ngozi Mine where there are old street guys who are bound to abuse us. They never tell us nicely, they just come in full force beating us,” he said.  They said they used to stay with some girls, adding that girls are easily convinced to go back home or to be taken to children’s homes. Thus, very few females are seen in the streets of Bulawayo.
