THE Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ) director-general, Dr Eve Gadzikwa, is set to step down from her post at the end of the month after 14 years at the helm of the national standards body. SAZ’s executive committee said Dr Gadzikwa was leaving the national standards body to take up a new regional assignment in the international private and public sector development arena. “The SAZ executive committee announces that Dr Gadzikwa will be stepping down from the position of director-general on June 30, 2022.  “Dr Gadzikwa has built a strong legacy of growth, sustainability, partnerships and shared value with the community having passionately championed standardisation nationally, regionally and internationally,” said the committee. She joined SAZ in 2008 and under her leadership, the organisation has grown to be a fully-fledged national standardisation body with regional and international affiliation and funds mobilised towards policy, business and capacity development agenda. To date, SAZ is one of the leading national standards bodies in Africa. “During her tenure, the standards body has gained an international footprint, working closely with various regional and international partners in the public, private and development space. <img class="wp-image-585846 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/sme-78.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/sme-78.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/sme-78-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Small to Medium Enterprises – Image taken from Shutterstock “The future for SAZ is very exciting, as the association moves towards delivering the interests of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Innovative Solutions at the Excellence Hub, Destination Inspection, Zimbabwe National Standardisation Project, SAZ digitalisation drive to promote a culture of excellence through standardisation,” it said. The executive committee said Dr Gadzikwa’s contribution to the growth and sustainability of SAZ is highly appreciated and together with her competent team of professionals, the body has gained international footprint. “We believe we shall be working closely with her, as she takes on a new regional assignment.”
Meanwhile, SAZ has started hunting for a new director-general. “The executive committee has commenced the search for a new director-general and has put in place solid systems and processes for an acting director general to manage the association during the transition.”
