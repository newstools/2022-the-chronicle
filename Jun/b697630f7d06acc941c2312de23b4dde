The Chronicle Cletus Mushanawani, in Chimoio, Mozambique ZIMBABWE is taking advantage of its historical ties with Mozambique which date to the days of the liberation struggle to increase its exports to the neighbouring country which have been on a positive growth trajectory since 2017. Following a highly successful Outward Seller Mission which was organised by the country’s trade promotion board, ZimTrade in Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo last month, this week, ZimTrade will be leading 16 Zimbabwean companies to a similar mission in Mozambique’s Manica Provincial capital of Chimoio. <img class="size-full wp-image-613945" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money Exports to Mozambique from Zimbabwe have been increasing since 2016 where the country exported goods worth US$26 million.

ZimTrade Chief Executive Officer, Mr Allan Majuru said they want to take advantage of the proximity of Mozambique’s Manica Province to Manicaland to increase trade between the two countries. “Mozambique is our third largest export partner in Sadc and we want to take advantage of existing ties to increase trade between the two countries. We want to take advantage of the two provinces’ proximity to grow exports so that we meet the 10 percent national exports targets set in the National Development Strategy (NDS1). “The two sister provinces enjoy cordial relationships and companies from both provinces should have synergies that will see the growth of their economies and Gross Domestic Products in line with the devolution agenda,” said Mr Majuru. <img class="size-full wp-image-585642" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-31.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-31.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-31-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Allan Majuru He also said the programme feeds into the Government’s thrust of increasing engagements with countries in the region and beyond. Mr Majuru said the calls by President Mnangagwa for greater ties between Zimbabwe and other African countries should result in increased visibility of Zimbabwean products in regional markets such as Mozambique. “We have seen increased engagements between President Mnangagwa and his counterparts in the region, and discussions have focused on trade, investment, and tourism,” said Mr Majuru.
