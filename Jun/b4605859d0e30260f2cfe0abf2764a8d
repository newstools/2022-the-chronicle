Broad money is a measure of the country’s money supply. The growth comes as some economic analysts have blamed the depreciation of the local currency on excess liquidity in the market. While the central bank had previously focused on keeping Reserve Money growth under a tight leash, with zero growth now expected per quarter going forward, analysts had focused on Broad Money supply growth as a source of currency instability. The local currency has depreciated from $220 per US dollar in January this year to approximately $600 per US dollar on the parallel market. In a recent interview with our sister paper, The Sunday Mail, RBZ governor Dr John Mangudya admitted that there is another source of money supply growth in the economy other than Reserve Money.  “The whole idea of reducing that money supply is to ensure that there is no excess money in the market to push inflation or to push the exchange rate, which has the pass-through effects of the exchange rate into the inflation numbers. “So, we have been doing that. Now, having done all those things, we found out there is another form of money in this economy, which is called broad money. “There is this other broad money that is going up which is out of banks lending, commercial banks lending money to the corporates,” said Dr Mangudya in the published interview. While there was zero growth on Reserve Money, Broad money between March and April grew by 13,97 percent. On an annual basis, broad money registered a growth of 156,17 percent, though down from 404,15 percent in April 2021. <img class="wp-image-551190 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/10-bond-notes.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/10-bond-notes.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/10-bond-notes-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bond Notes The local currency component of broad money grew by 155,04 percent; while foreign currency deposits increased by 156,57 percent.
