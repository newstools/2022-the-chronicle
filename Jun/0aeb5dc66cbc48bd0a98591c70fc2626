It targets women businesses across Southern, East and West Africa with key focus on “solutions catalysing increased access to capital for the success of women entrepreneurs”.  In a joint statement, programme drivers said the intervention will accelerate efforts to address gender inequality and drive inclusive economic transformation in the region. “We are thrilled to announce our new partnership with the African Development Bank Group to drive increased access to finance and markets for women-owned and women-led small and medium enterprises across Southern, East and West Africa,” reads the statement. “More than 500 growth-oriented WSMEs will be supported for scale, access to markets and investment readiness across eight African countries, which include Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. “The two-year programme will create a profitable pipeline of investable businesses ready to access finance.” AWIEF is a pan-African women economic empowerment organisation, which nurtures and actively promotes women innovation and entrepreneurship through its development programmes, accelerators, and networking events, including the annual AWIEF conference, exhibition and awards. <img class="wp-image-479069 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Nedbank-Group.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Nedbank-Group.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Nedbank-Group-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nedbank The programme is organized under four components – growth accelerator in partnership with Nedbank, electronic-commerce capacity development in partnership with UNIDO, digital skills in partnership with Amazon Web Services and mentorship and advisory meant to enhance the visibility and access to role models.
