FORMER Highlanders defender Bukhosi Ncube says the club dragged its feet in getting him special treatment for his knee injury forcing him to quit playing at the age of 20. Ncube quit football at the beginning of 2020 after a nagging knee injury. Ncube, who recently called on the club to get urgent special treatment for defender Andrew Tandi, told the Siqalo Podcast that his injury was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. <img class="wp-image-609424 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andrew-Tandi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andrew-Tandi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andrew-Tandi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andrew Tandi “I got injured at training back in 2018. This was my first serious injury. It was just a few minutes to go to the end of a training session ahead of a game against Chicken Inn when l went for a jump and landed awkwardly and injured my knee in the process. I was young so l think the doctors and even I relaxed and thought it was something l could recover from,” said Ncube. He feels Bosso could have handled his injury better. “Bosso did not take my injury seriously. The problem with football is they think they can replace anyone. You get injured and they put in someone else and life continues. I got injured in 2018 only to get an operation in August 2019.  During that I was aggravating the injury. “I felt the club should have noted that I was continuously getting injured and they should have made an effort to get me treated. For me, getting a youngster is an investment for the club. If they had got me treated earlier, I would have played and maybe they could have sold me later and made money,” he said. Ncube, who is a close friend of Tandi, hopes his friend will not suffer the same fate he suffered. “I don’t want Andrew Tandi to find himself in a situation similar to mine. He is my friend. We played together before. He is from Victoria Falls just like me,” he said. Tandi’s season came to an abrupt end after fracturing his right fibula (calf bone) and dislocating his ankle in the abandoned league match against Dynamos in April. <img class="wp-image-541335 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/mphelele.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/mphelele.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/mphelele-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pritchard Mphelele Meanwhile, Pritchard Mphelele has resumed light training four months after suffering a career threatening injury in a game against Caps United in March. At the time, Mphelele was ruled out for six months after tearing quadriceps on his right thigh. Mphelele, a former Young Warriors’ star, will be hoping to make an earlier than expected return to reset his career. — @innocentskizoe
