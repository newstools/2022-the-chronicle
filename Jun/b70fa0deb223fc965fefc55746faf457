Working alongside the Orchestra Mberikwazvo band, Macheso has churned out hits Shedia, Mundikumbuke, Madhuwe, Baba Namai, Teererai and Charakupa, among others over the years. The artiste’s publicity and digital media overseer Tawanda Mashava said there will be a pre-launch of the album today at the HICC VIP Lounge. “We’re having an Executives Night out tomorrow (today) for executives who might not be able to attend our other shows and the album launch where we’ll pre-launch the album. The actual launch is happening on Friday at the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex coupled with his 54th birthday celebration. We’ll livestream two hours of the event live on our Facebook and YouTube platforms. Radio Zimbabwe will also have a live broadcast of the event,” said Mashava. He said thereafter, they will release dates of a nationwide album launch tour. “A nationwide album launch tour will follow immediately after the release.  We promise to take the tour to as many places in Zimbabwe and are especially excited for fans in Victoria Falls, Bulawayo, Kariba and other places.” <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 cells Mashava added that since the advent of Covid-19, the artiste has been making use of digital platforms so as to ensure his works are accessible. “This year, there’s been a deliberate effort to take advantage of the digital platforms, hence the availability of the album on iTunes, Spotify, Buddie Beats and Gateway Stream with very few physical CDs being availed. “We’re also running various social media campaigns and will be launching a website very soon.” Added Mashava, “We’re also taking back ownership of our productions that have been wrongly credited on platforms like YouTube as we now have an official YouTube channel. <img class="wp-image-606445 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-78.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-78.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-78-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Youtube As such, fans can expect to see more interactions via social media and much improved digital platforms usage.” As a parting shot, Mashava encouraged young artistes to make music that resonates with the masses and use language that is acceptable and consumable. “They should also look at taking up positions in associations that have an impact on their music, like Zimura. They should also put in the effort during live shows and unite in the fight against piracy. “We also want to encourage them to invest their proceeds in other areas. During the lockdown, it was evident that artistes must have other businesses that can sustain them beyond music,” said Mashava. – @mthabisi_mthire
