THE Zimbabwe Gender Commission (ZGC) has identified over 60 girls who are either victims of child marriages or sexual exploitation in Umzingwane district, Matabeleland South province. <img class="alignnone wp-image-616315 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Child marriages are said to be rampant in the province with one in five girls said to be married off before they reach the age of 18. Most cases are dealt with at family level as families are not keen to report men who impregnate young girls. Small-scale miners and some well up members in the community are said to be driving the scourge by taking advantage of vulnerable girls in rural areas. Late last month, the Constitutional Court raised the age of consent for sexual relations from 16 to 18 years, to meet the minimum age of marriage as set in the country’s constitution. The ZGC is holding national public hearings on child marriages and sexual exploitation as well as abuse of young girls and on Thursday it was in Umzingwane district. “Regrettably this national inquiry is coming against a background of very high prevalence of child marriages, sexual exploitation and abuse of young girls in the country, particularly within some religious sects which is a cause for concern for the commission. The diabolic situation has challenged the commission to take incisive steps and amplify its voice on the issue into this national discourse through conducting this national inquiry to red flag the social injustices while at the same accelerate the responsive mechanism of redressing such social dis-functions,” said ZGC deputy chairperson Mr Obert Matshalaga. He said the inquiry will play a big role in addressing the problem as the commission’s findings will be taken to Parliament with recommendations on measures that need to be taken. Mr Matshalaga said the problem was not only limited to religious sects but was also widespread throughout the country. “According to the ZimStat’s macro indicator cluster survey, one in three, which is 32,6 percent of girls are married before the age of 18 while only four percent of boys married before that age. In Matabeleland South Province, child marriages stand at 22,2 percent which means one in five girls are married before they reach 18. Rural girls are twice more likely to be married before the age of 18 than their urban counterparts. The Covid-19 pandemic and other humanitarian situations have also contributed into this challenge,” he said. <img class="wp-image-596024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 Speaking at the same occasion, Chief Gwebu urged communities to work together to address the issue and said it was sad to note that the girls’ future was being destroyed through sexual exploitation and child marriages. “Let us be visionary and find ways of protecting children as we parents have the responsibility to raise children. It is sad that children are having their future destroyed as they forsake education due to pregnancies. We must talk to them while they are still young and seek help from extended family members like what used to happen before. We have a duty to raise and show the kids the correct way forward as what is happening is a shame,” he said. During the presentations after members were put into groups, some blamed the flashy lives of gold panners who use cash to lure young girls into sex. “Children have lost moral values and they are no longer respectful as they only consider their biological parents to be the only ones who can advise them. Technology is also contributing to the challenge as well as issues of hunger, some parents are not able to provide some things that make our children fall victims to sexual exploitation.  We also call on the justice system to be tough on offenders and issues of bribery must never be tolerated,” said one group in its presentation. –@themkhust
