THE Kamandama Memorial Fundraising Golf Tournament returns this morning after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic that brought sporting activities to a halt. <img class="wp-image-614584 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 The tournament tees off at the Hwange Logan Wishart Golf Club, to raise funds for the 63 remaining widows of the Kamandama Mine disaster that saw 427 miners perishing following an underground methane gas explosion on June 6, 1972. In addition, registration fees for the tournament will also be channelled to the widows’ fund. “The tournament makes a major comeback after the last massive edition was held in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. This year promises to be a grand fundraising event on the greens as the country commemorates the 50th anniversary of the 1972 Kamandama Mine disaster. <img class="alignnone wp-image-587825 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/golf-boss.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/golf-boss.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/golf-boss-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The golf tournament is hosted to fundraise for the 63 remaining widows of the tragedy,” said Hwange Colliery Company spokesperson Beauty Mutembo. The tournament will follow the 4BBB Stableford anonymous partner. The Stableford scoring is used for 4BBB Stableford. However, in this competition, two players will partner and each will play every hole in Individual Stableford using their own full handicaps.  Upon completion of each hole, the partners points will be the highest points scored on that hole. If both players score the same number of points on a hole, the score of the player who first completed the hole will be recorded. The golf course condition has vastly improved and the club is ready to welcome golfers from across the country and abroad this morning.
