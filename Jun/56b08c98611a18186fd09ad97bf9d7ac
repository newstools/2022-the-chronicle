The finale of Season 1 was held this weekend with three contestants battling for the grand prize. The winner, Harare-based Leah Kasinamunda walked away US$2 000 richer after shrugging off stiff competition from Gweru-based Leona Lillie Furusa who took second position and bagged US$500. So stiff was the competition that there was a tie between the two at one point. Fortunate Marygold Madzidza settled for third place and walked away with a US$200 gift voucher, all courtesy of Milan Family Restaurant.

Leona on the other hand sang Running by Beyonce, It’s All Coming Back To Me Now by Celine Dion and Amazulu by Amanda Black. <img class="wp-image-598938 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jah Prayzah Marygold sang One Night Only by Jennifer Hudson, Nyeredzi by Jah Prayzah and Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin.
