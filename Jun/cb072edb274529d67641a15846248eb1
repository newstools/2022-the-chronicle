HIGHER and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Minister, Professor Amon Murwira, has challenged young entrepreneurs to play a leading role in driving the country’s industrialisation. Zimbabwe is endowed with abundant natural resources and technical skills, which are key ingredients for industrialisation, said Minister Murwira. Through innovation hubs at universities, he said the Government has set up a platform for young people, innovators and researchers to develop their innovations to industry level with the aid of experienced staff in the area of technical skills development, entrepreneurship and business incubation. <img class="wp-image-614088 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Stewart-Moyo-exhibiting-his-products-at-the-National-Youth-Business-Expo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Stewart-Moyo-exhibiting-his-products-at-the-National-Youth-Business-Expo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Stewart-Moyo-exhibiting-his-products-at-the-National-Youth-Business-Expo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stewart Moyo exhibiting his products at the National Youth Business Expo Prof Murwira was speaking at the first edition of the National Youth Business Expo organised by the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, with the support from the African Development Bank (AfDB) last week in Bulawayo. “The national strategic intention is to make sure this country is not poor. We must develop the capability and be ready to take off.  The displays we saw show that we are ready for industrialisation. We are going to industrialise this country in a sustainable way,” he said. Professor Murwira said for the country to industrialise, youths should be confident in their innovations. “The development of a country is a mental game, it starts with us. We have to believe that to develop this country it has to develop based on its natural resources,” he said. Buttressing Prof Murwira’s call, Industry and Commerce Minister, Dr Sekai Nzenza said during her tour of stands after interacting with youths she observed that some were too shy to explain their innovations. “There is a lot of shyness. You own the idea but you seem to be embarrassed. There is no time to be shy anymore, it’s time to show that you are a Zimbabwean,” she said. “You must be confident and believe in yourselves.” <img class="wp-image-597913 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Sithembiso-Nyoni-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Sithembiso-Nyoni-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Sithembiso-Nyoni-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Sithembiso Nyoni Women Affairs, Community and Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, urged the youth to work towards expanding their emerging businesses into fully-fledged corporations saying the country depends on them. She added that the youths were a solid foundation and future of the country and should therefore strive to fully exploit their businesses potential. Minister Nyoni said it was critical for youths to be original in their innovations and build strong brands. “We saw innovative products, which can be competitive in the global market. We can grow small businesses into big businesses,” she said.
