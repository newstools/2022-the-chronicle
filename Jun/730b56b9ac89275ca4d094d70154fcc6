CitySure, which allows residents to buy vehicle insurance cover and also pay their monthly council bills in one place, has set up desks at a number of City Council service centres, including the Rowan Martin Building in the city, as well as from Borrowdale and Mabelreign council facilities. <img class="wp-image-615717 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-108.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-108.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-108-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gift Noko Econet Insurance Chief Insurance Officer Gift Noko said the disruptive innovation that was launched in April gives residents more time on their hands to focus on other important aspects of their lives. “The most important thing is to bring accessibility to our clients, making sure that they have access to insurance products wherever they are. This is one of the reasons why we partnered with the City of Harare because it has offices all over the city where our clients reside,” he said. Capitol Insurance Brokers managing director Philip Mutasa said the setting up of CitySure desks at council offices was part of the promise made by the trio when the product was launched nearly two months ago. “We are delivering on the promise we made at the launch. CitySure’s first objective is to demystify insurance. Most of our people view insurance as something that is very complex. We want to show everyone that insurance is the best protection against risks such as fire, theft and natural disasters on their assets, and is affordable,” he said.  Mr Mutasa added that the rollout of CitySure will guarantee that residents in all suburbs have an appreciation of insurance that covers senior citizens, vehicles, property, household contents and other assets on digital platforms. In addition to providing financial support and reducing uncertainties that individuals and businesses face, insurance also plays a crucial role in the sustainable growth of an economy by promoting trade and commerce. <img class="wp-image-615640 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-92.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-92.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-92-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> THE Insurance and Pension Commission (Ipec) Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC)’s director of insurance and micro-insurance, Mrs Sibongile Siwela, said at the launch event of CitySure that she hoped the service would promote financial inclusion and result in those previously underserved having access to affordable insurance products. “A baseline survey on the uptake of insurance that we conducted in 2019 found that distribution channels were one of the key barriers to insurance uptake. “We therefore believe that CitySure will help break that barrier and facilitate access to insurance by Harare residents in the comfort of their homes. I am advised that the intention is to scale up this exercise to cover other towns and cities, which is a welcome development,” Mrs Siwela said.
