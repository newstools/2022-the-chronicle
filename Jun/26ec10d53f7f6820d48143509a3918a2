The three participating countries, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, are set to field both senior and Under-19 teams. “Going to COSANA is going to help the Gems to prepare well for the World Cup qualifiers. It’s going to help the technical team to see where their strengths are and where their weaknesses are, so that if there is something they can do, they do it before the World Cup qualifiers. “It is also serving as preparation for the Manchester games, which are also meant to enhance or to give more practice to the Gems as we prepare for the World Cup qualifiers.  World Cup qualifiers are a very important event to netball because we have been to the World Cup (before), we want to maintain the momentum. <img class="wp-image-616434 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-204.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-204.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-204-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Netball World Cup And we are also aware there is going to be a lot of tough competition as African countries have prepared to qualify for the World Cup, which is being hosted by South Africa,” said Chipandu. Zimbabwe have been invited to play friendly games against some top European countries in Manchester, England, from July 17-24. Zimbabwe made their maiden appearance at the Netball World Cup in 2019 in Liverpool, England, and emerged eighth in the 16-team tournament.
