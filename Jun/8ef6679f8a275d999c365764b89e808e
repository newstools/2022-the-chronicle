WITH the National Culture Month in hindsight, the Matabeleland Cultural Awards Trust is keeping the cultural torch alive with the hosting of the fourth Umthwentwe International Cultural Expo that is slated for Amakhosi Township Square in Bulawayo this weekend. <img class="wp-image-615609 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-87.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-87.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-87-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Umthwentwe International Cultural Expo Matabeleland Cultural Awards CEO, Philani Ncube said the expo that will take place on Friday and Saturday is meant to unify cultural players in the Matabeleland region. “Umthwentwe International Cultural Expo is a cultural event that takes place annually in June. It brings together cultural players from the Matabeleland region,” he said. Exhibiting at the event, Ncube said will be weavers, carvers, traditional regalia designers, and cultural dance groups.  “We’re expecting to have different groups who’ll be showcasing different cultures and foods. The gist is to keep our cultural heritage alive in the face of extinction. Celebrating cultural diversity is a noble thing as it helps resuscitate and sustain most of the things that are part of our culture, but we have abandoned.” <img class="wp-image-615613 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-88.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-88.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-88-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thandanani Women’s Ensemble and Insumbizya This year’s expo will be held under the theme, “Building communities through culture” and will see Thandanani Women’s Ensemble and Insumbizya Cultural Dance group from Binga performing. Besides traditional dance, craftwork, literature, poetry, music and food will also take centre stage. Ncube rallied cultural artistes to register and attend the upcoming expo. <img class="wp-image-612205 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-93.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-93.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-93-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Africa Day The pinnacle of celebrating cultural diversity was highlighted by the Africa Day celebrations last month and the Umthwentwe International Cultural Expo also acts as a continuation of that. June is Bulawayo’s month as the city celebrates its declaration as a town. As such, the spotlight is shone on the city’s cultural landscape. — @eMKlass_49
