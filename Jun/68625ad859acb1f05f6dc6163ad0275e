The celebrations will be held at Matshobana Hall and will feature performances from Simunye Simunye, Umkhathi Theatre Works and Ezimnyama Dance Ensemble. Established in 1992, the ensemble has played a vital role in Bulawayo through edutainment programmes. It has also contributed to the birth and rise of many actors. The group’s project manager, Witness Tavarwisa, said the event is a way of expressing gratitude to the community that has supported the ensemble since its establishment in 1992. “Bambelela Arts Ensemble was established on the 20th of June, 1992. The ensemble has over the past years, produced more than two dozen of action-packed theatre productions, one film and numerous infomercial audio and video skits.  “The 30th-anniversary celebration is part of our community engagement where we’re saying thank you to the community for the support they’ve given us over the years,” said Tavarwisa. The group’s works have been displayed through roadshows, theatre performances in open spaces and radio dramas that have been aired on local stations. <img class="wp-image-619585 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-296.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-296.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-296-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Radio studio Their debut radio play that premièred last year was a 13-episode drama series titled Umtshado We Zinja which featured actors Josphat Ndlovu, Nyaria Ncube, Tawanda Mukoma, Nomvelo Bhehane, Leonard Phiri, Bongelani Ncube, Lorrin Sibanda and Khumbulani Mathe.
