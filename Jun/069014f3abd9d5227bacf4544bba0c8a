Dzimbadzemabwe Arts Ensemble has booked a slot to perform at the Chibuku Neshamwari traditional dance competition national finals after coming out tops at the Masvingo provincial finals. The provincial finals were held at Farai Beerhall on Saturday where nine other arts groups, Dzimbabwe, Ivhu Inhaka, Rufaro, Jeketera, Matande, Musa, Dare Rimwe, Guhudza, and Muhuru battled on the stage. Most groups showcased rain-making dances that included Mhande, Matendera and Majukwa while others performed Bira and Sadhiwesi dances.  For their outstanding performance, Dzimbadzemabwe walked away with a prize of US$2 500 while Jeketera and Dzimbabwe who came second and third respectively took home US$1 500 and US$1 000. Dzimbadzemabwe director, Trynose Trust Chakawa said the win came as a shocker because the competition seemed too stiff with most groups giving outstanding performances. “The competition was so tight and we didn’t expect to win because all the groups performed very well. As much as my group delivered its best, the other groups were quite good and we can only thank God for taking us this far. “This was our second time to win the Chibuku Neshamwari provincial competitions as we won in 2017 and had the opportunity to represent Masvingo province in the national finals that were held in Mutare,” said Chakawa. In Mutare at the competition that was won by Bulawayo’s Khaya Arts, Dzimbadzemabwe took fourth position.
Chakawa said they hope to win this time around and will pull out all the stops. <img class="wp-image-440193 size-article-featured-image" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/khaya-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/khaya-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/khaya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khaya Arts Dzimbadzemabwe was formed in 2012 and is made up of at least 35 members, although only 15 are allowed to participate in the competition. Leader of Jeketera Arts Ensemble Prince Jeketera said despite being first-timers, the group expected to perform better than it did. “This was our first time attempting Chibuku Neshamwari competitions as a group. I wasn’t impressed with our performance as we expected to come out first because of the work that we had put in,” said a disheartened Jeketera. Other groups that participated in the Masvingo finals received a consolation prize of US$500 each. The action continues this Saturday with Gwanda set to host the Matabeleland South finals at the Manz’amnyama Beerhall. <img class="wp-image-605607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money Matabeleland South NACZ provincial manager Percy Vela said preparations for the provincial finals are at an advanced stage with nine groups confirming their participation.
