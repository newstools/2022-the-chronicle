The Chronicle Business Reporter PREMIER African Minerals Limited, which is developing the Zulu lithium and tantalum project in Insiza District, Matabeleland South Province, says there is potential for early production in the first quarter of 2023. In a latest public update, the group’s chief executive officer, Mr George Roach, said based on results from initial phases of test work undertaken on ore, potential opportunity exists “for Zulu to be brought into early production based on a large-scale pilot plant”. <img class="wp-image-617094 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-33-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-33-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-33-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Petalite “Pursuant to receipt of results from initial phases of test work undertaken on ore sorting by Anzaplan in association with Stark, it is clear that a potential opportunity exists for Zulu to be brought into early production based on a large-scale pilot plant using ore sorting technology to concentrate spodumene rich ore from other lithium minerals and gangue material before milling and floatation to produce a spodumene concentrate only and stock pile both a tantalum-rich fraction and petalite for future processing,” Mr Roach said.  Spodumene is lithium used to make batteries, while petalite is a lithium mineral that is used in the production of glass and ceramics. Mr Roach said production could start as early as the first quarter of 2023. “Shareholders should note that no funding has yet been arranged for this possible pilot plant and among many aspects of this whole concept still under scrutiny, this will still require completion,” he added. Last year, the diversified mining group made a placement of £1 million for the ongoing definitive feasibility study at the Zulu Lithium project. The placement is intended to ensure there is no interruption to the work in progress at Zulu as well as allowing additional time to enhance value through the DFS and comprehensively and without any pressure, assess other options available to fund the balance of the DFS. <img class="wp-image-609763 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lithium Mr Roach said the current demand for spodumene and the resultant prices, significantly support Premier’s recent focus in terms of both our drilling programme at Zulu that is now exclusively targeting high grade spodumene zones within the ore body at an indicated resource level, and on aspects of the DFS in relation to implementation of the pilot plant. “Importantly, operation of the pilot plant will fine tune aspects of the process that will support the DFS. Further details will be provided in due course along with details of any finance arrangements, together with illustrative valuation and revenue projections for the pilot plant.” <img class="wp-image-617091 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-32-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-32-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-32-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Spodumene According to the update, a total of 18,000 meters has been drilled at Zulu. The group has a diverse portfolio of projects, which include tungsten, rare earth elements, lithium and tantalum in Zimbabwe and lithium and gold in Mozambique, encompassing brownfield projects with near-term production potential to grass-roots exploration. Premier African Minerals Limited is a multi-commodity mining and natural resource development company focused on Southern Africa with its RHA Tungsten and Zulu Lithium projects in Zimbabwe.
