The Chronicle Makhadzi has come a long way from performing for free two years ago to walking away with two awards at the DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards (MVCA) this past weekend. The Matorokisi singer walked away with the Favourite Music Artiste or Group award as well as the Song of the Year award for her hit song Ghanama featuring Prince Benza on Saturday night.  At the Sun Arena and across the different social media platforms, it was Makhadzi who topped the trends lists as her fans celebrated her wins. Makhadzi jokingly thanked God she wasn’t fluent in English. She reasoned that not knowing the language allowed her to sing in her mother tongue which is how she became a fan favourite. She also revealed she begged to perform at the last awards for free, knowing that                                                             one-day things would change. Taking to Instagram on Monday, the hitmaker said she hopes her story will inspire others. <img class="wp-image-617413 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-36-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-36-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-36-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prince Benza “Two years ago I asked and begged to perform at the DStv MVCAs for free as that was my chance for SA to at least know there is a girl called Makhadzi. Jikijiki, here I am collecting awards. I cannot thank my fans enough for this and next month, I have a tour in the UK”. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, Makhadzi said the world tour has come at the right time. “I didn’t intentionally set it out, the opportunity came at the right time. I’m definitely ready and excited, to be honest. Travelling around the world has always been something that I’ve wanted to do. To be able to do what I love and travel is a dream for me.” Makhadzi said if you told her 15 years ago that this was how her life would be, she would not have believed it. “I could never have imagined it, but I’m extremely grateful. I’m definitely going to be making more music and I’m looking forward to investing in my businesses. I still have other business that I’m working towards so when the time is right, I will venture into those too.” – TimesLive
