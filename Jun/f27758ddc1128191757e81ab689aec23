Jump on the internet and discover the dishes that pair best with his favourite drink. Wine, brandy, and rum are all great contenders and, for the dad who prefers a non-alcoholic option, try ginger ale, sweet teas, or lemonade. Then, prepare a spread. Not only is this a great activity to bond over, but seeing everyone’s reactions to the pairings could be priceless. Take a road trip Nothing beats bonding in the car to the soundtrack of your best years. First, plan all the stops you intend to visit on your road trip and ask dad if there are places he would like to see too. Once you have your game plan, grab some snacks and hit the road. Travelling is a great way to spend quality time together, make new memories and reminisce over old times. Who knows, some of his past adventures might resurface and help you understand him even better. <img class="wp-image-618601 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-6-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-6-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-6-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Radio personality Babongile Sikhonjwa with son Qobo Head down memory lane Show dad that he is the most important person by taking an interest in all the places he used to visit when he was younger. Drive around town and ask him to stop and show you his old hangout spots, his old school, the house he grew up in, and even where he and your mum first met.
