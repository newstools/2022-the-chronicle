Tied the knot on . . . April 30, 2022. Venue . . . Esigodini. How did you meet? . . . We met at church and started off as friends.

Not much as our families and church members were of great help. It was the anxiety that got the worst of us though. Wedding colours . . . Dusty pink and navy blue. The most touching moment . . . was when we exchanged vows. It was a heart-to-heart moment. Also, when I entered the hall and saw all the people who were gathered for our great day, I was touched. <img class="alignnone wp-image-618643 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Guest list . . . 450.
