The conference will also seek to find ways of maximising mining contribution to the economy beyond today and consolidating growth drivers for the mining industry and also funding solutions for the mining industry with reference to the international experience. Chamber of Mines chief executive officer Mr Isaac Kwesu has said the conference comes at a time when the outlook for the mining industry is positive, buoyed by an encouraging commodity price upturn that has seen mineral prices surpassing their long term averages. <img class="wp-image-582902 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Mr-Isaac-Kwesu1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Mr-Isaac-Kwesu1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Mr-Isaac-Kwesu1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Isaac Kwesu The country is targeting export revenue from minerals to US$12 billion by 2023 as it seeks to transform the country into an upper middle-income economy by 2030. The US$12 billion mining industry represents a 344 percent increase from the US$2,7 billion registered in 2017. The growth of a multi-billion dollar industry will be driven by gold, platinum, diamond, chrome, iron ore, lithium, coal, and other strategic minerals, officials say.
