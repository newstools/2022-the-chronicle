VICTORIA Falls-based Afro-fusion band, Flying Bantu is set to perform at the World Music Day celebrations taking place in Bulawayo on Friday evening.  The event that is being organised by Alliance Française de Bulawayo is a partnership with an events venue, Southern Cross Estate. World Music Day is an annual celebration observed on June 21 around the world. The first World Music Day was observed and celebrated in 1982 on the Summer Solstice in France when the former French minister of art and culture, Jack Lange, along with Maurice Fleuret came up with the Fête de la Musique in Paris. That is why World Music Day is alternatively known as Fête de la Musique. <img class="wp-image-617380 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-31-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-31-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-31-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fela Kuti Flying Bantu which was launched in 2016, has played in several countries including Canada and South Africa and locally, they are regulars at the Vic Falls Carnival among other events. The band’s founder and lead singer Tinashe Maoneni said they are excited to be performing in the City of Kings and Queens. “We’re very excited about our upcoming show in Bulawayo.

Our inspiration is drawn from old-time musicians like Bob Marley, Don Gumbo, Oliver Mtukudzi, Fela Kuti and Lovemore Majaivana. We play music that we believe means something on a bigger scale and we focus on producing something that can go beyond the borders,” said Maoneni. Maoneni said they are working on an album that is set to be launched before year end. <img class="wp-image-523378 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lovemore-Majaivana.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lovemore-Majaivana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lovemore-Majaivana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lovemore Majaivana “We’re working on our second album which is going to be our third body of work. The album is being produced by Keith Farquharson, a former Ilanga keyboard player and we’re looking forward to premièring it before the end of the year.” The Nama award-winning group that has an EP and album titled Ceasefire was recently accepted to play at the Music in Africa Access showcase in Dar es Salaam.
