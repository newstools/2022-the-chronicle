AS they were being rushed to Mater Dei Hospital after both tested Covid-19-positive, Mrs Ashell Ruswa’s husband died on the way and she could not attend his burial as she remained hospitalised for three weeks. <img class="wp-image-615193 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mater Dei Hospital That was last year and Covid-19 was at its peak in the country and globally. After trying some home remedies, the couple was taken to a hospital in Zvishavane and following tests, Mrs Ruswa and her husband tested Covid-19-positive. Ash and David, as their peers in the business world called them, were told they needed oxygen and ventilators. A journey to Bulawayo was arranged for them and bookings were made at Mater Dei Hospital where they were supposed to be admitted. Mrs Ruswa’s lonely life began. She managed to make it to Mater Dei Hospital but unfortunately her husband died along the way. Because Mrs Ruswa was admitted to the hospital for three weeks, she failed to attend her loved one’s burial. As at June 23, 2022, Zimbabwe had 255 246 confirmed cases, including 248 050 recoveries and 5  546 deaths. Covid-19 was a life changer to Mrs Ruswa, her daughter and the 96 employees she has in her companies. But after beating Covid-19 and putting her effort and energy into the business her husband had started, Mrs Ruswa was recently crowned Businesswoman of the Year at the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Midlands Businesspeople of the Year Awards held recently in Gweru. The businesswoman runs three schools and has a property development company. Fellow businesspeople and invited guests at the function gave her a standing ovation as they appreciated the effort she has put from beating Covid-19 to running a successful business. “July 25 is the day I will never forget in my life. As long as I live, I will remember this day when I lost a friend, a partner, a lover and the father of my child. <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 I lost David, Mr Ruswa to Covid-19. Covid-19 left a gap in me, in my family and the companies that will never be filled,” she said in an interview during the awards. “I lost a husband and a number of close friends and relatives to Covid-19. My husband was buried while I was still in hospital and in a critical condition. I survived Covid-19 with some scars to my health which I have had to endure.” Mrs Ruswa said the loss of her husband and partner in business gave her strength to fight and grow the business in memory of her loved one.  “It started on 21 July when Mr Ruswa had come back from the rural area where he had attended a funeral. He was then unwell. We were sweating, the headaches and the usual Covid-19 symptoms. We started taking home remedies and some medications and unfortunately clinics and hospitals were not taking people with Covid-19. The fact that I failed to attend his burial kills me. If only I was there to say goodbye to my friend,” she said as she failed to control her tears. After three weeks of receiving care and medication at Mater Dei Hospital, Mrs Ruswa was discharged. Mrs Ruswa said after getting better, her daughter and some relatives were there to guide and comfort her. “Chief achievement after the Covid-19 heartbreak was the construction of a school in a space of three months. Covid-19 left a void but it has given her a new lease of life,” she said. Mrs Ruswa said her dream is to build a big and state-of-the-art health care centre for the people of Zvishavane and surrounding areas. “I will never forget that period last year because the health facilities were just overwhelmed and that is why we had to go to Bulawayo. So, I dream of building a state-of-the-art health facility so that people have somewhere to run to instead of travelling to Gweru or Bulawayo for medical attention,” she said. Born Ashell and raised by two loving parents, a father holding a humble job in a bank and a mother who proved to be an enterprising vendor, Mrs Ruswa has worked hard to change her life story. As the eldest child in a family of eight, she grew up having many responsibilities which included minding the vending stalls after school and nursing the little ones. She said having ventured into the corporate world and practiced as a credit controller, she left the comfort of the office to try her hand in business in 1994. “Over the years, with skill and determination I grew the business from a small hair salon to a thriving business with vast business interests,” said Mrs Ruswa. A loving mother of one, a widow, a brave and focused leader, Mrs Ruswa added: <img class="wp-image-621238 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-24-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-24-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-24-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) “I am grateful to ZNCC Midlands chamber for recognising my achievement at a time when I was still mourning my husband. While that was tough, I tried to remain resolute, to remain dedicated and committed to making our business remain standing.”
