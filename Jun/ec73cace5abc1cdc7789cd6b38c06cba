Climate change is aggravating human-wildlife conflict as they compete for limited resources in order to survive. The impact of climate change has resulted in significant decreases in crop yields and available grazing areas for livestock due to decreasing rainfall. Competition between game and livestock has increased, contributing to an escalating level of human-wildlife conflict. To date, 40 lives have been lost as a result of human-wildlife conflict. According to the latest statistics, 200 elephants died in 2019 due to starvation. Zimbabwe’s elephant population is estimated to be more than 100 000, which is more than double its ecological carrying capacity of about 45 000. <img class="wp-image-620884 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-60-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-60-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-60-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) spokesperson Mr Tinashe Farawo Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) spokesperson Mr Tinashe Farawo said there was a need to educate communities on climate change issues and conservation solutions. “We need to educate people that there is a problem first, in that way they can also be part of the climate and conservation solution. As a result of an increase in human and wildlife populations, we have continued to see the conflict between the two escalating,” said Mr Farawo. He said it was imperative that elephant populations are controlled. “It’s high time animals pay for their upkeep and culling is a potential revenue stream. We last did culling in 1987, as of now, there have not been any mechanisms to control elephants. The most pressing challenge is the number of animals we have.  We need to manage the numbers. The current overpopulation of elephants is a disaster waiting to happen, especially now when climate change has ravaged most of the farmer’s crops. Communities find themselves fighting over the limited food with animals,” said Mr Farawo. “At the last COP in Geneva, we put up a proposal as a country to ensure communities speak for themselves and their issues are not voted for by people without any contextual understanding.” Mr Farawo said when parks run out of water, animals tend to scavenge for it within human settlements. “To date, we have lost 40 lives as a result of human-wildlife conflict and the numbers could go up,” he added.
Hyenas that are on the prowl in Gwanda District are forcing some farmers to sell their livestock. Farmers are losing cattle to hyenas, resulting in insurmountable losses. <img class="wp-image-620887 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock Some farmers from Reata Farm said they had resorted to selling their livestock to avoid disappointment when hyenas pounce on their beasts. “If one of your animals doesn’t return from grazing in the evening, you’re almost guaranteed that you’ll never see the animal alive again. Hyenas are attacking our beasts which is forcing us to sell them instead of suffering losses from their death,” said one of the farmers, Mr Rapulana Ramakgopa. He said he was now old and couldn’t handle the stress of dealing with missing cattle. “The only solution for peace of mind is letting go of the cattle and getting money out of them. At least I would’ve benefited something, instead of losing my investment to hyenas,” said Mr Ramakgopa. – @Yolisswa
