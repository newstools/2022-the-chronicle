ORGANISERS of the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon have availed 100 free slots for Bulawayo and Matabeleland North athletes to take part in the race on July 3. The marathon is returning to the premier resort city after a two-year absence caused by Covid-19. It was held as a virtual marathon last year after Covid-19 restrictions were eased. The marathon starts in front of the Kingdom Hotel downhill and across the iconic Victoria Falls Bridge towards the Zambian border. <img class="alignnone wp-image-613317 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ECONET.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ECONET.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ECONET-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Runners then turn on the Zambian side just before the border gate and run back across the bridge into Zambezi Drive along the Zambezi River past the Big Tree into the Zambezi National Park. The route runs up into the Kazungula Road and turns to come back to finish at Baobab Primary School. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-613939" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab), which has worked with Econet over the years on the marathon, has been offered free slots for those wishing to be part of one of Africa’s most popular road races. The athletes have to be Econet subscribers and can register through Bab. Bab chairperson Watson Madanyika said the selected runners will, however, have to cater for their own transport and accommodation in Victoria Falls.  “We have a good relationship with Econet as they also did that last year when they held the virtual marathon. Students had an opportunity to register for free. I would like to thank Econet company for their support for athletics and I want to encourage those who would like to participate to register early to avoid a last-minute rush. The free slots are for the 7.5km, 21.1km and 42.2km races,” said Madanyika. The Victoria Falls Marathon attracted a field of about 3 500 participants from more than 40 nationalities around the world when it was last held in 2019, making it one of the biggest and most anticipated events on the global running calendar. – @innocentskizoe
