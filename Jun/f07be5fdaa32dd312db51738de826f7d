DYNAMOS and Caps United fans will be hoping for a big turn up by their teams in the Harare Derby as the giants are set to provide the last big spectacle on Sunday at the National Sports Stadium before the league takes a two-week mid-season break. The derby, which has always been one of the major highlights on the calendar, always provides a platform for the giants to fight for bragging rights in the capital more than anything else. <img class="size-full wp-image-609222" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Sports Stadium This has been the norm since the late 1970s when Makepekepe stormed into topflight football. The stage has often been explosive although the games have of late been played under different conditions. The two Harare giants will need to give their fans something to talk about for the next 20 days when league action will be on break. The Premier Soccer League announced that there will be no domestic football until June 25 as they observed the annual mid-season break. The decision by the PSL leadership, however, has been met with mixed reactions mostly from the fans. The break comes just after the league had missed a week to attend to issues of violence and hooliganism.  In fact, this will be the third break when factoring in the extended festive holidays and Afcon break, which came just after the first three games of the campaign and the season-opening Chibuku Super Cup. The clubs went on a two-month break then and needed a fresh “pre-season” training before resuming the programme. The PSL said the upcoming break will only be two weeks. “This serves to advise that the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League will take a two week break after the conclusion of Match day 17 fixtures scheduled for 3-5 June 2022. “PSL matches will resume on Saturday 25 June 2022. We advise clubs to liaise with stadium owners to ensure that all the necessary stadium maintenance work is done during this period. We are grateful to all our stakeholders for their continued support,” said the PSL statement.
