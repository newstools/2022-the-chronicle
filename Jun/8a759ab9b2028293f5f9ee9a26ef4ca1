The video was dropped on the musician’s YouTube channel on Sunday and judging by comments, the musician is making progress. The song mourns moral decay in society as a result of social media where people have lost moral values. “On this song, we’re highlighting how social media has changed ubuntu bethu.  “Through social media, families are being destroyed and people have lost ubuntu as they are sharing pictures of the dead at accident scenes instead of assisting,” said Sikhosana. He said he roped in Dube because of his appreciation of cultural issues. “I featured Obert because he knows our culture. “If you listen to the song and watch the video, you’ll see that he articulated the issue very well. Collaborating with him was also a way of spicing up my work.” Sikhosana said his career has taken a good turn as he is getting invitations to perform at functions like weddings and is planning on conducting live shows. <img class="wp-image-616059 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-51-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-51-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-51-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> South Africa-based Ernest Masongela The artiste who is employed as a truck driver sings traditional gospel music that was made popular by the late Brian Sibalo, Revonia Khumalo and South Africa-based Ernest Masongela.
