FOR the love of ‘bling,’ a security guard in Bulawayo stole a car from a garage he was watching over and decided to paint the town red in a joyride that ended in tears when he crashed the vehicle. Kevin Netai Mangwengwe (47) of Njube hatched a ‘brilliant’ idea to cover up for his boob by making a false report to the police that armed robbers had attacked him at the garage and taken the vehicle.  Sources told Chronicle that Mangwengwe failed to resist the allure of a silver coloured Nissan Almera that was parked overnight at Veza Mechanical Garage in Kelvin North. He decided to steal the shiny car. Leaving the premises unattended, Mangwengwe allegedly set-off for a night of merry-making and was spotted at several places having the time of his life. The show-boating spree ended when he crashed the vehicle at Makalanga Beer Garden in Mabuthweni, sustaining bruises and a swollen hand. For his false report, police have arrested Mangwengwe. <img class="size-full wp-image-613762" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/car.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/car.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/car-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A silver coloured Nissan Almera Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said it was a matter of concern that some people were making false armed robbery reports. “We have realised that there are some armed robberies that are claimed to be happening, which tend to be false. Like this one, where a security guard who during the night thought of having a joyride and then crashed the vehicle. He then reports it as an armed robbery,” said Inspector Ncube. “As police, we are urging members of the public not to leave car keys at car parks and also the owners of the garages and car parks to employ trustworthy security guards to prevent such incidents from happening.” Insp Ncube said Mangwengwe stole the car on 17 May. “At around 0320hrs on the 17th of May 2022, the accused took the complainant’s vehicle without his permission and drove it to different places on a joy ride and had an accident. After the accident, the accused dumped the vehicle in Pelandaba,” said Inspector Ncube. <img class="size-full wp-image-570156" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Inspector-Abednico-Ncube-.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Inspector-Abednico-Ncube-.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Inspector-Abednico-Ncube--360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube He said at around 7AM the same morning Mangwengwe reported that he was robbed of a car. “At around 0700hrs, the accused falsely made a report at ZRP Western Commonage claiming that he was robbed at the garage and a vehicle was stolen. The police attended the scene and the accused had a swollen hand and bruises on the cheek and was referred to the hospital,” said Inspector Ncube. “On the same date at around 0820hrs, an informant from Pelandaba phoned ZRP Western Commonage reporting that there was a dumped vehicle near his house; which matched the description to the one reported stolen by the accused. The vehicle had accident damage.” Police further questioned Mangwengwe and he confessed that he took the car on a joyride and dumped it near the beer garden after he had an accident. He was immediately arrested. – @bonganinkunzi
