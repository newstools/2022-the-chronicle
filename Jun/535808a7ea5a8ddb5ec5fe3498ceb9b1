MUTARE-based outfit Majesa Academy were crowned champions of the inaugural Marvelous Nakamba Foundation Under-17 tournament played at White City Stadium on Saturday and Sunday. <img class="alignnone wp-image-621601 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-130-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-130-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-130-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Majesa beat Highlanders 2-1 in the final that was played before a good crowd, which braved the chilly conditions to watch the youth football tournament final. Striker Norest Mazemo and Kieth Muzengeza were on target for the Manicaland side, while Nhlanhla Musaliwa scored the solitary goal for Highlanders. Majesa only found their way into the final after the disqualification of Dynamos, who were found guilty of age cheating.  The DeMbare juniors had won their group, but could not proceed to the last four. Highlanders, Majesa Academy and Njube Spurs were in the same group with Dynamos. The disqualification of Dynamos meant that Highlanders and Majesa Academy went into the semi-finals from that particular group as winners and runners-up respectively. Ajax finished top group of Group B, while Chicken Inn were second. In the first semi-final, Highlanders were 1-0 victors over Chicken Inn, while Majesa beat Ajax Hotspurs 5-0. Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi was the guest of honour at the finals, with Marvelous Nakamba handing over the trophy to the winners. <img class="wp-image-595235 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-19-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-19-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-19-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi Initially, the competition was meant to take place last year, but could not take place in 2021 after the country went into lockdown following increased cases of Covid-19, but easing of restrictions allowed the event to go ahead without any hitches this year. The tournament has been hailed for giving young players from across the country a platform to showcase their talent. — @innocentskizoe
