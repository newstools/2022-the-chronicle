Preparations for the fourth edition of the Mapopoma Festival to be held in December in the resort city of Victoria Falls are underway. This comes as the festival grapples with the full opening of the arts sector. Last year, the event failed to take place due to Covid-19 prevention measures. However, an Easter edition was held this year. Without a doubt, fans were given value for their money from music maestro Jah Prayzah, sensational songstress Feli Nandi and Amapiano muso Mzoe 7. The festival’s spokesperson Leslie Phiri said the festival will run over three days from December 30 to January 1 with each day set to have its own theme. <img class="wp-image-610314 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-83-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-83-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-83-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Feli Nandi A Home Brewed Concert that will feature local acts will be held on December 30 with an Ubuntu Concert slated for December 31. A Colour Fest has been organised for January 1, 2023. “The initial concept of Mapopoma Festival is a three-day festival with each day running under its own theme. This was, however, put on hold in the last two editions due to the Covid-19 restrictions. “We’re therefore reverting to our themed festival to appreciate the diversity of our culture and the arts industry, especially in the cosmopolitan city of Victoria Falls which is rich in culture,” said Phiri. <img class="wp-image-611157 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mzoe 7 “Mapopoma Festival believes in the promotion of local artistes and domestic tourism. As such, Home Brewed is about appreciating the distinct Zimbabwean sound. It’s all about amplifying and celebrating Zimbabwean music, be it Tshibilika, Sungura and Zimdancehall, among others. This is the night of standing together as Zimbabweans through music and art, celebrating local talent,” he said.  Phiri said the second day will resemble the main vision of the festival. “Premised on our motto which is Culture Embraces Culture, the Ubuntu Concert is the ultimate night where we’ll come together to celebrate the reality of the passing year and collectively prepare ourselves for the journey ahead in the coming year. “Most crucially, it’s about reflecting on what binds humanity – love, peace, tolerance and unity which are all virtues of Ubuntu,” he said. <img class="wp-image-598938 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jah Prayzah The Colour Fest, Phiri said, is all about uniting people using colour. “This is the colourful day where families, friends, couples, and singles and anyone in general, are invited for a very colourful festival. “All those who’ll attend the Colour Fest will experience a once-in-a-lifetime moment to be donned in all the beautiful colours of the rainbow,” said Phiri while adding that they are still finalising venues for the event. – @mthabisi_mthire
