“THANK God it’s Friday” is one of the most used phrases when people are anticipating fun, but Bulawayo rapperholics thank the hip-hop gods for Saturday’s second edition of Bulawayo’s premier hip-hop show, the Flowfest. The first edition held in March at Club Hashtag was marred by heavy rains, but expectations are high for the second instalment of the show scheduled for Crystal Nightclub this Saturday. <img class="wp-image-615345 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Crystal Nightclub One of the organisers of the festival, award-winning hip-hop radio presenter Thorne Laroq said he hopes for better fortunes at the upcoming Flowfest. “The second edition of the HipHopCapital FlowFest returns this week in the city of Kings after being postponed due to the multitude of events associated with the trade fair period. We’re now set and hope for better weather this time. “The FlowFest is a celebration of ourselves and our craft. It seeks to provide a platform for all things hip-hop in the country mixed with a handful of performances,” Laroq said. The first Flowfest saw rappers Luminous, CTL, The Original Gang, DJ Mark V, Fab G, Indigo Saint, Ganyaz and Rockie DoUb performing.  On Saturday, the trend will continue with RapThan, T3rry Tempo, Noreen, NoluntuJ, KidThrill, Lynden, Scarrah, Lamas Ellz, Thug Poetic and Cliff Jeans taking to the stage. The four-hour event will be characterised by a bit of comedy, spoken word, break dance and of course, the performance sets. Hip-hop artistes expressed happiness at the prospect of being part of the event. “I love the fact that the efforts of those of us working hard are actually being recognised. Although the Bulawayo arts industry is the least respected, the HipHop Capital movement is proving to be iridescent towards building and upping our local hip-hop industry. “In simpler terms, I’d like to thank everyone who’s putting in work. Let’s support even if   it’s not us all performing,” said X_TheLyricalVenom. <img class="wp-image-613812 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/bfbf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/bfbf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/bfbf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rapper X_TheLyricalVenom Rapper Ngadlangadla said the initiative is an exciting one for the city of Bulawayo. “It’s really exciting to see a couple of dope hip-hop acts doing what they do best on stage. The energy, beats, bars, flow and metaphors all show that the city is improving. I attended the first one and was happy to see that hip-hop is alive and well in the city and it’s yet to grow to be bigger and greater,” said Ngadlangadla. – @eMKlass_49
