TRADITIONAL leaders in Matabeleland region have called on Government to expedite food distribution as most communities have become food insecure following poor rains in the 2021/22 summer cropping season. This comes as President Mnangagwa has assured the nation that no one will go hungry as Government will provide food aid to vulnerable communities. <img class="wp-image-610998 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/President-Mnangagwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/President-Mnangagwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/President-Mnangagwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Traditional leaders have said the drought situation could also increase abuse cases among the vulnerable population. Chief Masendu, from Bulilima who is also Matabeleland South Council of Chiefs provincial chairperson said the drought issue is a matter of national concern that needs urgent attention in rural areas. “We are faced with a drought situation and most of our communities did not harvest anything. Most of the crop was a writeoff and we are looking forward to Government’s intervention. Some people are now forced to buy mealie-meal as they did not harvest anything and the reality is that most of them cannot afford it,” said Chief Masendu. He said the girl child becomes more vulnerable during droughts. Chief Masendu said even the crime rate rises when there is a drought in communities. “At the same time, we see a lot of young people skipping the border going to South Africa or Botswana as a result of drought. It really affects the social fabric. We have already discussed the issue as the Provincial Council of Chiefs and the National Council of Chiefs on the drought issue. <img class="wp-image-592690 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Masendu Our position is that the situation is dire and there is a need for Government interventions,” said Chief Masendu. He said in some communities even livestock will be affected as water has become scarce. Chief Nyangazonke from Matobo shared similar concerns that most communities did not harvest anything following the poor rainfall season. He said the drought could worsen social inequalities that were caused by the outbreak of Covid-19 where some people lost their jobs. Chief Nyangazonke said when Government introduces grain relief, there is a need for auditing and monitoring to ensure that the vulnerable are not left behind.  “The challenge that we are seeing is that it could contribute to early pregnancies and child marriages and increase abuse cases because of poverty. It also increases child labour and it will be even worse for child-headed families. While we have the Social Welfare Department I don’t know if it will be able to handle all the cases,” said <img class="wp-image-557317 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Chief-Nyangazonke.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Chief-Nyangazonke.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Chief-Nyangazonke-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Nyangazonke . He said pastures have also been affected hence Government should also find ways of assisting livestock farmers. Chief Nyangazonke said traditional leaders should be given some grain as well as part of Isiphala seNkosi as they know the most vulnerable in communities. Matabeleland North Provincial Council of Chiefs chairperson Chief Shana from Hwange said Government should chip in and provide communities with grain relief. “The truth of the matter is that most people did not get a good harvest. The rains were not so good and I think by August the situation will be dire for a lot of people and we appeal for Government’s intervention,” said Chief Shana. <img class="size-full wp-image-592751" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Chief-Nkalakatha-Ndiweni.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Chief-Nkalakatha-Ndiweni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Chief-Nkalakatha-Ndiweni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Nkalakatha Ndiweni Chief Nkalakatha from Nkayi said traditional leaders recently participated in a Government food relief mitigation meeting where a commitment was made that communities will soon start receiving grain. He said the food distribution will protect particularly the girl child from abuse. “There is an urgent need to start the food distribution as was promised because a lot of our people did not harvest anything in the past season. This will enable pupils to remain in schools because in a drought season we have in the past observed children dropping out of school. A drought season also affects payment of fees in schools,” he said. Chief Nkalakatha said even the girl child risks being abused when there is no adequate food at home. “For example, we have gold panners in my community, they will end up luring the girls as they have money. So, in light of these challenges, there is a need for Government to speed up the distribution of grain to prevent social ills,” said Chief Nkalakatha. — -@nqotshili
