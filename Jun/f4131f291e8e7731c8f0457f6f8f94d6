THE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has embarked on a project to upgrade and commercialise its accommodation facilities as it angles for increased tourism earnings. The wildlife authority is a major tourism player through its vast packages. <img class="wp-image-481058 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/HWANGE-NATIONAL-PARK.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/HWANGE-NATIONAL-PARK.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/HWANGE-NATIONAL-PARK-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange National Park It also offers accommodation facilities in major national park areas such as Hwange National Park, Sinamatela, Robins as well as in Lake Chivero and Nyanga. Under the on-going upgrade exercise, the wildlife authority wants to modernise Hwange Main Camp facilities and others to offer quality service on standard furniture, decoration and menu services. The move dovetails with the National Tourism Recovery Growth Strategy, which is expected to help the sector to achieve the US$5 billion tourism industry milestone by 2025. <img class="wp-image-615007 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  National Tourism Recovery Growth Strategy In an interview ZimParks business entrepreneurship manager for north-west Matabeleland province, Mr Peter Nyadowa, said a significant number of clients going on game drives and other tourism activities usually book at Main Camp where there are 23 lodges, 18 of them single and five double, 11 chalets and 11 cottage units. ZimParks has since renovated one cottage, which is being used as a pilot project with more upgrades expected. “We are now changing from cottage type of accommodation to a bed and breakfast facility whereby our rooms are self-contained with bedding facility, tea station and ensuite,” said Mr Nyadowa. “As clients book, they pay for bed and breakfast. This is a pilot project targeting cottages and if we see that it will be working, we are going to renovate the chalets.”  He could not disclose the budget for the project but said their target was to upgrade four cottages by September adding that the authority was focused on enhancing its appeal in line with global customer trends. “Tourism is dynamic and as ZimParks we realised that we have a niche market that favours national parks. We have been shortchanging our clients,” he said. “There are 11 cottage units at Main Camp, which we are now changing into bed and breakfast. This is business expansion through new product development as we are also promoting our restaurant.” Mr Nyadowa said ZimParks was keen to promote its products with no extra charge demanded for room service. — @ncubeleon
