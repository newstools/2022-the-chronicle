HEALTH experts have warned members of the public against abusing antibiotics to treat common colds and flu during the winter season as temperatures continue to plummet. Members of the public are likely to contract respiratory diseases as a result of dropping temperatures but doctors said sometimes some of the diseases can be treated without flooding health institutions. Both flu and common cold have similar symptoms although flu is more severe and may cause fever. Members of the public often abuse antibiotics and these, according to experts, do not cure the virus which causes flu or cold. Continued abuse of antibiotics is a worrying trend which may lead to antimicrobial resistance. In an interview, Dr Misheck Ruwende from Mpilo Central Hospitals said although flu and cold cases may increase, there was no need to panic. <img class="size-full wp-image-604228" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/MPILO-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/MPILO-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/MPILO-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mpilo Central Hospital He said both conditions which are the most common respiratory diseases in Zimbabwe especially during winter, can be managed by resting, drinking lots of water and paracetamol. “When one has flu, antibiotics will not help and using them can cause harm such as antibiotic-resistant infections, which are difficult to treat. This problem is fast growing in Zimbabwe and it is important for members of the public to note that while we are in the winter season, they can be safe from colds and flu without abusing medication,” he said. “Flu and the common cold are most common during winter as people spend much time indoors and it makes the transmission easier from one person to the other. The symptoms for the common cold include runny nose, sore throat, sneezing, headaches and body aches and for flu the symptoms are similar except that they are more severe and may include fever.” <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 Dr Ruwende said members of the public should continue adhering to Covid-19 prevention guidelines as they also prevent the spread of flu and colds.  He said people should always wash their hands with soap and water to avoid contracting and transmitting flu and colds. Kissing, hugging and shaking of hands easily spreads these two conditions as well. “It is important to protect others so when one has flu or cold, it’s best they stay at home and avoid contact with others. It is important to note that common colds are caused by a virus which that body can cure naturally. We need to create an enabling environment for the body to fight off the virus,” he said. Dr Ruwende said many people rush to doctors thereby increasing the burden on the healthcare system when they can recover while resting at home. “They should only visit the doctor when symptoms do not clear in a week, in cases of pneumonia or when they have difficulties breathing especially if the temperature fluctuates,” he said. Dr Ruwende said for body aches people can use paracetamol which works effectively without forcing doctors to prescribe antibiotics. Over the counter flu and common colds medication and steaming with gumtree leaves does not cure flu and colds but only helps ease the symptoms. “Ideally these symptoms should clear in a week or two and therefore, people should not use antibiotics thinking they will recover. We see a worrying trend where people even go to private doctors demanding antibiotics prescriptions to address colds and flu. This should stop and antibiotics should be taken only if prescribed by a doctor for serious ailment.” <img class="wp-image-592382 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-24-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-24-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-24-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Meteorological Services Department The Meteorological Services Department (Met) has said the cold weather is expected to become more severe in the coming weeks. Bulawayo, Matabeleland South, Masvingo and parts of Manicaland provinces are expected to experience severe cold weather. “Keeping warm is important for everyone to avoid catching a cold. For expert advice on preventative and redemptive measures for colds and flu, please consult your local health practitioner,” read a statement from the department. It said those who opt to use braziers to keep warm should ensure the room is well-ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. — @thamamoe
