GOVERNMENT has heightened measures to detect monkeypox, which has been detected in 42 countries excluding Zimbabwe. The Ministry of Health and Child Care has strengthened monitoring measures and laboratory testing mechanisms to detect monkeypox cases. The new measures have been put in place at a time after South Africa recorded its first monkeypox case last Thursday, which involved a 30-year-old man with no travel history. Monkeypox symptoms include rash blisters on face, hands, feet, eyes, mouth, genitals and peri-anal areas. Victims may also develop fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, muscle aches and fatigue.  More than 2 000 monkeypox cases have been recorded since January in Europe, America while the disease was initially concentrated in West African countries in the early 2000s. Speaking during a post-Cabinet media briefing yesterday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said the public should be aware that the country has not recorded a monkeypox case as the country strengthens surveillance measures. “Cabinet wishes to inform the public that there are no cases of monkeypox reported in Zimbabwe. The country has, however, put surveillance, laboratory testing and case management measures in place in preparation for any potential outbreak,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. She said the public should put emphasis on implementation of Public Health and Social Measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 as they are effective in preventing monkeypox cases. Minister Mutsvangwa said the measures include regular washing of hands and social distancing. She said the country will also use the lessons learnt in dealing with the Covid-19 in educating the public about monkeypox. <img class="size-full wp-image-594708" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Monica-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Monica-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Monica-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa “Our country must take advantage of lessons learnt from the Covid-19 response and mount a strong monkeypox preparedness and response strategy and the Risk Communication Sub-Committee must immediately embark on a monkey pox information dissemination exercise,” she said. The minister said the public should not let their guard down as far as Covid-19 prevention is concerned and the country remains vigilant while strengthening the pandemic testing levels. “Provinces should come up with innovative strategies to increase vaccination coverage and focus on the elderly and those with underlying chronic health conditions and implementation of all Covid-19 public health and social measures must be continued,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. Meanwhile, she said Vice-President and Health and Child Care Minister Dr Constantino Chiwenga briefed Cabinet that the country recorded a decline in Covid-19 infections in comparison to the previous week. <img class="size-full wp-image-603940" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> VICE President, Dr Constantino Chiwenga “The number of new Covid-19 cases continued to decrease, with 552 cases having been recorded, compared to the 676 recorded the previous week, marking an 18 percent decline. An average of 79 new cases was recorded per day, compared to 97 new cases the previous week,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “Furthermore, a total of 22 Covid-19-related new admissions were recorded during the week, compared to 34 the previous week. No patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. This indicates that the Covid-19 pandemic remains under control, as it has been for some months now.” She said while the country recorded a decline in new infections in the past there was a global surge in Covid-19 infections.
Minister Mutsvangwa urged citizens to get vaccinated to minimise the risk of experiencing severe symptoms when they contract the virus. — @nqotshili
