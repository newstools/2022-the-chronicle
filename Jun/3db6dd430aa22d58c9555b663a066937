THE revival of CSC Boustead Beef Zimbabwe is expected to boost the goat breeding sector as farmers will be able to supply the meat processor with feedstock for local markets and exports, which will promote rural industrialisation. <img class="wp-image-581524 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-34-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-34-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-34-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Dr Anxious Masuka Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka, said this last Friday after touring the CSC Bousted Beef factory in Bulawayo, which is set for re-opening in August. The minister said the revival of the giant factory, presents a credible off-taker where farmers can begin to realise better value for their effort. The Government is already running a Goat Pass-On Scheme, which is expected to uplift rural communities across the country where three million households are expected to benefit from this year until 2025. The scheme would initially distribute 600 000 animals. “Under the Presidential Rural Goat Pass-on Scheme, we envisage that this year we will give out the first 600 000 goats and by 2025 we hope to have five million or more goats and the market is already established,” said Dr Masuka. <img class="wp-image-614998 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> CSC Boustead Beef Zimbabwe “So, CSC Boustead resuscitation will mean we have a credible off-taker where farmers can begin to realise better value for their effort.” Before its closure, CSC used to export beef, sheep and goat meat to several countries but was forced to stop due to viability challenges.  CSC used to play a leading role in the processing and marketing of Zimbabwe’s beef since its inception in 1937. In 2010, the cash-strapped CSC was forced to abandon an ambitious project to supply goat meat to Angola as farmers expressed dissatisfaction with supplying small stock on credit to the company. CSC intended to collect the goats from farmers and slaughter them before selling the meat to Angola and paying the farmers later, an arrangement that was turned down by farmers. Dr Masuka said CSC Boustead is resuscitating plants for large and small stock, which will feed into the export market. <img class="wp-image-612310 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> UAE “When we were in the UAE we were requested to supply large stock and small stock,” he said. “CSC Boustead was also there and is already aware of the market and we are excited about it. We should take full advantage of such opportunities, particularly communal farmers.” Dr Masuka said with the resumption of operations drawing closer, communal farmers must gear up to deliver a steady supply of livestock to the factory. Livestock is a major source of livelihood for most families in rural Zimbabwe and the death of goats and cattle leaves such households without incomes and the much-needed draught power, exposing them to food insecurity. Increased livestock production is significant in the broader agriculture sector, the mainstay of the country’s economy. The Government, development partners and the private sector have agreed to intensify collaboration toward robust revitalisation of the entire beef, goat and leather value chain.
