In an interview, group co-founder Sotja Moyo said they are working on obtaining visas. “Our international tours stopped due to the loss of one of our members, Alex Ncube in 2018. We were in the middle of preparing for a tour and had to abort it. “This was followed by further cancellation due to the coronavirus outbreak. <img class="wp-image-620575 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-385.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-385.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-385-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Canada Since then, our fans have been waiting for us in Europe, Canada and USA and we’re looking forward to meeting them,” said Moyo. He said they will use the tour to celebrate their 40th anniversary with their international fans.  The 40th-anniversary celebrations, Moyo said will also be held across the country. “When we return home, we hope to stage a big party for our local fans as we conclude our celebrations at the end of the year. This year, we are celebrating our journey which has been full of excitement and some challenging moments. <img class="wp-image-612205 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-93.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-93.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-93-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Africa Day “On Africa Day, we hosted a special brunch with some of our friends and families at Enkundleni Cultural Centre to celebrate the anniversary. 2022 is a year dedicated to celebrating Black Umfolosi legacy,” he said. As part of the anniversary celebrations, the group is working on a new single. “We’re working on releasing a single which is yet to be named. People should expect to see more young people taking part in making our dream go forward,” said Moyo.
