Following a letter of demand to Amapiano giants Kabza de Small, DJ Maphorisa and ShaSha for half a million rand after the trio’s no show at this year’s Vic Falls Carnival despite having been paid to perform, ShaSha has finally issued an apology letter. <img class="wp-image-614968 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vic Falls Carnival The trio was supposed to perform at the carnival on April 30 and failed to pitch. Event organisers tried to book the artistes for the next day but all that was in vain as the artistes “were not cooperative”. This left the carnival team with no option but to demand that the South African-based artistes pay back the booking fee, money used on flights and accommodation and “most importantly, apologise to the fans who travelled all over the world to see them perform”. That was not to be as the artistes chose to be mum. Only yesterday morning, a month later, ShaSha decided to issue an apology. “Hello to all my friends and fans who attended this year’s Vic Falls Carnival. I’d like to apologise to you and to the festival too, for not attending this year’s edition,” wrote ShaSha. <img class="size-full wp-image-606607" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/DJ-Maphorisa-Shasha-and-Kabza-De-Small.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/DJ-Maphorisa-Shasha-and-Kabza-De-Small.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/DJ-Maphorisa-Shasha-and-Kabza-De-Small-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Maphorisa, Shasha and Kabza De Small ShaSha who part ways with her management team of eight years at the beginning of the year, went on to explain that she was going through a transition. “Over the past few months there have been a lot of changes in my environment. A lot of you might have noticed my silence on social media too. It’s important that I share with you all that right now. “I’m at a moment that marks the end of some things but the wonderful beginnings of others too. In the middle of it all, I was unable to fulfil my commitment to be part of the carnival.” She assured fans that she would certainly make it up to them. “I know this caused a lot of disappointment, but I am asking you to please trust me to make it up to you. My team and I are working hard to come up with a new plan, together with the festival organisers who have been incredibly patient and supportive.  “I hope we can announce our plans, alongside some even exciting news in the weeks to come. I can’t wait to perform for all of you.” Browsing ShaSha’s social media pages, it was evident that she had not been as active this year, certainly indicating that something could be amiss. On May 2, she changed her profile picture on Facebook and uploaded a dark picture. After reading her statement, it seems that her fans were not sold as they felt that she was taking them for a ride. “Meet Shasha, the first African artiste to say nothing in 200 words and 722 letters,” commented one on her post. Most quizzed why she accepted the payment from carnival organisers yet she seemingly knew she was not going to be able to perform. Another said the apology was long overdue making it seem like she does not care about her followers and event organisers. “First things first, the apology is long overdue. I for one celebrate local talent and hailing from Mutare, you were one of the reasons why I ensured that I made it for the opening night. For an international act like yourself, that was unbecoming and to think I canvassed for votes to get you the BET award. <img class="wp-image-614974 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> BET Award Small as my contribution was, it got you the BET award. “You were paid to perform and failed to show up for the carnival. You had thousands of people anticipating seeing you perform. It would have been better if you had advised us well in advance that you were not going to make it to perform at the carnival.” Some of the fans asked if the new plan that ShaSha is working on will entail free tickets for carnival-goers. Following ShaSha’s response, Carnival organisers confirmed that they are indeed discussing the way forward with her. “We’re in discussions on a way forward. As organisers of the carnival, we’re also discussing discounts for next year’s tickets to all of this year’s ticketholders,” carnival festival director Craig Bright said. He said Kabza de Small and DJ Maphorisa are still silent.
