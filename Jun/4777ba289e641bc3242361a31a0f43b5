THE construction of Mandihongola Clinic in Gwanda District, which is nearing completion, is set to lighten the load for villagers who had to walk up to 20 kilometres to access the nearest health facility. Plumbing and carpentry work in addition to a few other final touches are being finalised before the clinic can open its doors to the community.  Four staff houses have been constructed at the site bringing the value of the project to about $18,4 million. The clinic, which was constructed using devolution funds, will not only be accessible to Ward 11 villagers, but to villagers from other parts of Matobo District as well. Construction of the clinic is in line with Vision 2030 where members of the public should be able to access quality health care services near their homes. Gwanda Rural District Council chief executive officer Mr Ranga Sibanda said minor works were pending before the construction of the clinic could be declared complete. “The construction of the clinic has been progressing well and is almost complete. The carpenters are in the process of putting up doors and plumbing work is also being done. The septic tanks have already been constructed. We’re now doing the final touches but the major aspects of the project have been completed,” said Mr Sibanda. <img class="size-full wp-image-598824" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Gwanda-RDC-CEO-Mr-Ranganai-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Gwanda-RDC-CEO-Mr-Ranganai-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Gwanda-RDC-CEO-Mr-Ranganai-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gwanda RDC CEO, Mr Ranganai Sibanda He said the completion of the clinic would make life easier for villagers who had to walk long distances to access the nearest health facility. “Community members used to go to Ntalale which was very far but once this clinic opens its doors, the distance villagers had to walk to the nearest clinic will be significantly reduced,” said Mr Sibanda. He said neighbouring areas from Matobo District would also be able to access the clinic. “The clinic site is not far from Matobo District so it will not only service communities in Gwanda District alone,” said Mr Sibanda. He applauded Government for availing resources for developmental projects to local authorities saying traditional sources of revenue were not adequate to undertake such projects. <img class="size-full wp-image-621922" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mandihongola-Clinic.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mandihongola-Clinic.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mandihongola-Clinic-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “But with the coming in of devolution funds, we find ourselves able to embark on infrastructural development projects which is a need in our district,” said Mr Sibanda.
