Bosso will remain in position 10 with 20 points, two ahead of Harare City. <img class="alignnone wp-image-526162 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> With their match against Dynamos having been abandoned in injury time last month with the scoreline reading 1-0 in their favour, Highlanders are almost certain of getting maximum on a 3-0 scoreline after Dynamos fans invaded the pitch and also attempted to uproot the goalpost.
