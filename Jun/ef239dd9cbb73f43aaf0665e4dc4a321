The much-anticipated Ndebele sci-fi, The Signal by Daniel McGregor Lasker is set to première in Bulawayo next month. The film that is set to change the local film industry was shot in Bulawayo and will première for two days, July 22 and 23, at the Zimbabwe Academy of Music. Since the release of the trailer last month, many have been impatiently waiting for the day when they will be “corrupted by a deadly sound transmitted from space known as The Signal which corrupts the minds of all who hear it, turning them into soulless demons under its control”. <img class="wp-image-608107 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Daniel-McGregor-Lasker.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Daniel-McGregor-Lasker.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Daniel-McGregor-Lasker-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Daniel McGregor Lasker The first première will be a red carpet event on 22 July in the evening at 7:15pm.

It is about a spiritual encounter with a cyber-object meant to act as a cerebral assassin. The trailer of the movie, which has over 27 000 views on YouTube, was released last month and whet the appetite of local movie lovers as it took them on a spiritual journey. It surely was a glimpse of what Zimbabwean filmmakers are capable of with many now waiting to watch the whole film.
