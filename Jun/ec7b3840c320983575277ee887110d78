National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) Matabeleland South provincial arts manager Percy Vela said everything is in place for the event. “The artistes are eager to perform and we’re happy that with the expansion of the Culture Week to Culture Month, we’ve received immense support from the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation; the Municipality of Gwanda and the business community who have greatly supported the event,” said Vela.  He said cultures found in the province will be given the spotlight. “Attendees should gear up for exhibitions, various performances, and displays of cultural foods. “We’ve also decorated cultural Roundavels which are a signifier of the various cultures that are found within the province,” said Vela. This year, things changed for the better as Zimbabwe expanded Culture Week into a reconstituted Culture Month to accommodate cultural activities that had been taking place for over a week in the month of May. <img class="wp-image-616074 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Unesco Since the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity by Unesco in 2001 when May 21 was declared as the World Day of Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, Culture Week has been held during that week. — @mthabisi_mthire
