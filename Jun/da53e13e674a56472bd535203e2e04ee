We’re looking for both male and female actors aged between 16 and 21 to be part of our short films. These auditions will help us pick characters we want to use soon. “We’re just looking for talent so I urge the youth, especially the girl child, to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said. Besides age, exceptional talent will be picked from acting ability. The initiative that is supported by Plan Zimbabwe and Plan Finland, has in the past, been a vehicle to foster conversations and movies advocating for fair treatment of the girl child. — @eMKlass_49
