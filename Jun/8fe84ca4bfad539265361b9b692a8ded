THE massive US$1,5 billion Hwange electricity expansion project has resulted in Ingagula suburb under ward 13 being relocated to Empumalanga area in ward six which is more than 10km away. The suburb had a clinic, primary and secondary school as well as a football stadium which is home to Zifa Southern Region Division One side ZPC (Hwange). <img class="size-full wp-image-583172" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> US dollar The relocation comes amid reports that two more suburbs, Lusumbami, which houses Hwange Colliery Company employees and National Railways of Zimbabwe’s Ngumija suburb could also be demolished. Ngumija suburb is said to be sitting on deposits of high grade coal. Open cast mining is already underway barely 400m away from houses and Lusumbami Primary School in Lusumbami suburb.
Ingagula has 258 houses which are now set to be demolished with the area becoming a coal dump site, according to local Councillor, Lovemore Ncube who said construction of new houses in Empumalanga has already started after the Hwange Local Board allocated land for the new suburb. Besides the expansion project, residents had for long complained of coal dust coming from the power station which led to health challenges. “Zesa as a company is relocating Ingagula suburb to Empumalanga suburb because it is within the radius of the Hwange expansion project. As I speak construction of housing has started. <img class="size-full wp-image-577740" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Untitled-27-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Untitled-27-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Untitled-27-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange Ward 15 Councillor Lovemore Ncube “The other reason is the health of the residents because of smoke, dust and ash emissions from the power station which for a long time was affecting the suburb,” said Clr Ncube. He said the land allocated by Hwange Local Board was not just for houses but can also accommodate a clinic, a school, a shopping mall and recreational facilities. “Residents are expected to be moved to the new suburb before the end of the year and the commissioning of the first phase of the expansion project is also expected before the end of the year,” said Clr Ncube. The ground-breaking ceremony for the Hwange power station expansion was held in June 2018 while the main construction of two additional coal-fired units of 300MW capacity each was started in March 2019  The power station is expected to generate more than 60 percent of Zimbabwe’s electricity needs following the expansion.
The project is funded by China Exim Bank, Sinohydro and the Government of Zimbabwe through the Zimbabwe Power Company. The project has already created employment for locals in line with the Second Republic’s Vision 2030 which aims to transform Zimbabwe into an upper middle-income economy.
