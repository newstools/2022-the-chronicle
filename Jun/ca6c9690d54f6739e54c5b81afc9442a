The Chronicle Think you’ve got what it takes to play the “Squid Game”? Netflix is giving fans of the hit Korean series Squid Game a chance to prove themselves by hosting a reality TV show inspired by the survival drama. On Tuesday, the streaming platform announced that they would be hosting “the biggest reality competition ever” at the Banff World Media Festival, according to The Hollywood Reporter. And just like Squid Game, the show will have 456 contestants — which will be the largest cast in a reality competition to date — battling it out in a series of mind-boggling games to win the massive cash prize of US$4,56 million. Before you panic and start to think the streaming giant will be knocking contestants to an early grave, let us just say that stakes aren’t life or death. Specific games haven’t been announced, but we are already wondering if the 10-episode series that will be “full of tension and twists,” will contain an IRL, non-fatal version of the Red Light, Green Light doll, tug-of-war match, and dalgona candy challenge. <img class="wp-image-618703 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwang Dong-Hyuk Since Squid Game season 2 is in the works, we hope to see some inspiration from the new episodes as well. Looking to be a part of the few that will get to don a green tracksuit? Here’s how you can nab a spot in the competition. Netflix is currently open to receiving applications for potential contestants from around the globe, as long as the applicants can speak and understand English, as directions for the games will be given in English over a loudspeaker. To apply, Netflix is asking that you submit a one-minute video explaining who you are, why you want to be a part of Squid Game: The Challenge, what your winning strategy would be, and what you would do with the historically-huge cash prize if you were to win.  Participants must also be over 21 and able to commit to filming for four weeks in early 2023. Since filming isn’t expected to begin until 2023, we suspect that the competition won’t hit our screens until late 2023 or early 2024. But fret not! Meanwhile, Squid Game was officially renewed on Netflix on Sunday after its successful first season. The Korean series, which premièred in September last year, followed a group of poor civilians fighting for their lives in a deadly competition in order to win enough money to pay off their debts. The series quickly became a pop culture sensation after going viral on social media: Replica costumes from the show were worn at protests, YouTubers and other groups pledged to recreate the games in real life, and new memes and TikTok trends were inspired by the games in the show. <img class="wp-image-618706 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-24-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-24-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-24-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lee Jung-jae A month after its release, Squid Game became the most-watched series on the platform and broke records by becoming the first foreign-language series, and first Korean series, to be nominated for a Screen Actors Guild (SAG) award. The show’s creator, Hwang Dong-Hyuk originally told Variety and The Hollywood Reporter that he wasn’t too keen to do a second season of the hit show, telling THR that the stress of filming the first season caused him to lose six teeth. However, in November, he confirmed in an interview with AP Entertainment that he was in the “planning process” for the second season saying: “You leave us no choice.” Season 1 ended on a cliffhanger leaving several questions for the audience. The most crucial question was to do with the lead character Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a kind-hearted gambler. After winning the death competition at the cost of his friend Cho Sang-woo’s life, Gi-hun fell into a depression. He then discovered that the creator of the competition was one of the competitors he befriended, Oh Il-nam (Hideo Kimura). At the end of the finale, Gi-hun is faced with a decision to move on with his life and be with his daughter or stop the deadly game once and for all. He appears to choose the latter. Squid Game creator Hwang confirmed that Gi-hun will return for the second season. While the extent of his role in the second season has not been clarified, he will likely be fighting against the people in charge of the competition. <img class="wp-image-618709 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-25-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-25-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-25-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hideo Kimura Hwang’s statement also confirmed that the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) will return in season 2 and “the man in the suit with ddakji” (Gong Yoo) may also make an appearance in season 2. Both characters were villains who were part of the secret organisation running the deadly competition. Much of season 1 follows a detective, Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon), going undercover in the games to find his missing brother who had previously taken part. However, in episode 8, Hwang discovers that his brother is now the Front Man leading the games and his brother shoots him before the detective can expose their operations. <img class="wp-image-618712 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-26-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-26-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-26-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wi Ha-joon We never see Hwang’s body which could mean the character could return in the second season to try and save his brother. Hwang actor Wi told Deadline last year that he also wants his character to return alive. “I’m dying to know what happened to him,” the actor said. “As a brother, I would ask him sincerely. As a detective, I want to explore the overall secrets behind the game as well. I really hope to see Jun-ho come back alive and explore all these questions. I hope to see a more brotherly-love side of their relationship as well.” “The man in the suit with ddakji” refers to Gong Yoo’s unnamed character who appears in the series première and finale. He is the recruiter for the games and plays a Korean paper game, Ddakji, with possible contenders before roping them into the competition. – Seventeen/Inside
