ZIMBABWE National Boxing and Wrestling Board (ZNBWCB) Matabeleland South coordinator Maculwamahle Nkomo says they are on a massive drive to tap into boxing talent in the rural areas. The association is casting its nets wider into rural Matabeleland South as part of its efforts to revive boxing. It’s currently focusing on the Gungwe community just outside Gwanda town. Nkomo says there is high interest in boxing in the province despite the sport facing sponsorship problems.  “At present we are trying to set up an academy in Gungwe. We have had quite a high number of people that have shown interest in the sport from that area. The level of acceptance of boxing there is encouraging. The challenge we are faced with is getting a coach and sponsorship so that we meet the financial obligations of running the academy,” said Nkomo. <img class="alignnone wp-image-463149 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Victoria-Falls-Boxing-Academy-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Victoria-Falls-Boxing-Academy-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Victoria-Falls-Boxing-Academy--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The idea is to create world champions from this area. We are not only talking of male boxers, but female ones as well. We want to have tournaments deep in the rural areas because we believe that is where the real talent lies. ‘They just need exposure. Most of the times youngsters from these rural areas fight a lot in their social activities while herding cattle and we need to channel that energy to something positive that can even put food on the table for them. <img class="wp-image-613563 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-11-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-11-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-11-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Herding cattle “People from rural areas are generally strong and the manual work they do will come in handy.”
