On the decks will be Nicksoul and Jaziri while Soulistiq will host the event. Master Zhoe said: “Turning 37 years old is something that I’m grateful for. Life alone, apart from the music industry has been a hard nut to crack. From my childhood deep in the roots of Mberengwa, I never imagined myself being a force to reckon with in the mining town of Gwanda.  “I’m someone who doesn’t like parties or celebrations, but however, taking a look at where I’ve been and where I am today, I felt the need to celebrate with friends, family and fans. Reason being that I want to appreciate them for supporting me, so this celebration is not really for me, but for them.” Celebrating his birthday last year, Master Zhoe released a track and visuals for his single Huya. It is not clear if he will do the same this year. – @mthabisi_mthire
