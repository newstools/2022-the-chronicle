MANY are amused by images of new Highlanders’ communications and marketing officer Nozibelo Maphosa sipping the traditional Chibuku Super beer. Quite possibly some people that saw this image would have thought that’s what led to her engagement by Bosso.
The picture attracted attention immediately after Bosso announced her appointment on Thursday, with people expressing mixed feelings. However, Maphosa is unapologetic about it, saying she loves to have fun, as an outgoing and very sociable person. <img class="wp-image-614577 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chibuku “I feel like everything was preparing me for this job. I got to trend on social media after a picture of me drinking Chibuku Super did rounds on social media particularly on Twitter. As a result of that picture, Chibuku identified me and I got called by the former (Highlanders) CEO Nhlanhla Dube to do a video to mobilise people for the Chibuku Super Cup in 2019. I gladly took the offer for the love of the team and it was perfect in the sense that we went on to win the Chibuku Super Cup title. Bosso is a big brand and I am honoured that they have trusted me before and again this time,” said Maphosa. <img class="wp-image-614575 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-60-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-60-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-60-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nhlanhla Dube But her love for the club did not start with the video promo. “I believe my love for football and Highlanders is a result of socialisation. Growing up, my brother loved Highlanders passionately. I was never a football person, but he influenced me into developing an interest for football. “At the beginning I felt I should just support Bosso because I come from Bulawayo, but my love for the club grew as I started attending more and more matches and the club sort of grew in me,” she said. <img class="wp-image-594973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders Maphosa, who did her internship at our sister publication Sunday News, replaces Ronald Moyo, who vacated the position after being appointed chief executive officer at the beginning of April. Moyo’s portfolio was limited to communication and media, but Maphosa will also handle the club’s marketing. “It’s a dream come true honestly. I have long wanted to be part of this family. My dream is to achieve a lot, brand the team, revive its name again, and make revenue for the team because that’s what marketing is all about at the end of the day. <img class="wp-image-588905 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ronald.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ronald.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ronald-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ronald Moyo “I want to prove that women can work and actually succeed and excel in football. I believe that women also love football as much as men do and me being here is proof of that. Hopefully we’ll see more women coming to the stadium to back the team as football is also a family sport,” said Maphosa. She, however, says she feels intimidated by the task at hand, but believes she is in good hands. “I am intimidated, I feel like everyone is watching me, and this is a big club and you can’t afford to fail. But I am in good hands; the CEO will mentor me throughout the journey, because this has been his office before me.”
Maphosa has been tasked with developing an integral communication plan for internal and external communication as well as organise fundraising activities and brand promotions.  She will also monitor the overall image of the institution as well as evaluate, create and update communication materials, co-ordinate and facilitate ongoing internal and external public relations and communication activities.
Maphosa holds an Honours Degree in Media and Society Studies, and a Masters Degree in Marketing Strategies.
She did her primary school at Rangemore before moving to Premier High in Pumula and Zezani High School in Gwanda for her secondary education. She has previously worked at Promobile, LimeFit Garage and Forecourt doing marketing. — @innocentskizoe
