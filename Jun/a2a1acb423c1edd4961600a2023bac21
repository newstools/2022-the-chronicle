The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City might be sinking deep in the relegation zone, second from bottom of the Castle Lager Premiership table, but their players are attracting interest from local and regional teams. City have reportedly received written offers from table toppers Chicken Inn and Bulawayo Chiefs for the services of central defender and skipper Vincent Moyo as well as central midfielder Melikhaya Ncube. The duo is a vital cog at City and has been consistent in the municipal side’s quest to wade out of the relegation waters. <img class="wp-image-592824 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Scorer-.-.-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Scorer-.-.-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Scorer-.-.--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Melikhaya Ncube Moyo (26), is also reported to be on his former team Highlanders’ wish list, but it is the Gamecocks who have made official overtures to snap up the tidy defender to provide cover for aging Moses Jackson and Guide Goddard. Chiefs are reportedly in negotiations with City for the 24-year-old box-to-box midfielder Ncube, who has three goals.
City sources revealed that 24-year-old utility player Lesley Dumo Lunga’s move to Highlanders could hit a snag following an injury. Lunga can play at right-back, as a right winger or central midfielder. Roving City left-back Wilfred Munorwei (23) has reportedly left for Swaziland, but City are adamant that the player is still contracted to them. <img class="wp-image-598847 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/BULAWAYO-City-FC-winger-Wilfred-Munorwei.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/BULAWAYO-City-FC-winger-Wilfred-Munorwei.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/BULAWAYO-City-FC-winger-Wilfred-Munorwei-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wilfred Munorwei City spokesperson Thandiwe Moyo confirmed that they have received offers for some of their players, but declined to reveal names. “It’s exciting that our players’ performances attract interest from suitors. Only two clubs, Chicken Inn and Bulawayo Chiefs have officially inquired about some of our players and negotiations are ongoing at club-to-club level. I can’t comment on what you could have heard about other teams being interested in some of our players’ services,” said Moyo.  On Munorwei, she said: “He is our player and remains contracted to Bulawayo City FC. I can’t comment further than that.” Chronicle Sport is reliably informed that striker Wisdom Mutasa, who was released from his contract is club hunting in Mozambique. —@ZililoR
