Mupasi scored two goals in the first-half before completing her goal rout in the second-half. Chiefs’ second-half substitute Nomqhele Donga scored a brace, with playmaker Patience Ndlovu the architect of most of their goals, capping a fine afternoon with the last goal.  Victory against the police side powered Chiefs to the top of the table and coach Evans Netha is over the moon following their blistering start. Netha believes the first three games of their 12-team league are key in shaping their topflight promotional challenge. “We’re happy with the way we started which has resulted in us collecting three points. We’re also happy that we kept a clean sheet,” Netha said. Ubuntu Queens were the biggest opening weekend scorers after banging in seven goals past Bulawayo Queens in a 7-2 rout. Ubuntu sit in second position on the table due to an inferior goal difference and Western Rangers who edged Lobengula City Queens 2-1 are in third place. Meanwhile, Highlanders Royals have merged with Sobukhazi High School in a deal that saw the high school’s players and technical team moving to Bosso. <img class="wp-image-616735 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-247.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-247.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-247-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sobukhazi High School According to Killian Hadebe, the Southern Region Women’s Football secretary and also a member of Sobukhazi, the school is set to benefit from experienced coaches provided by Highlanders. On Saturday, Royals drew 0-0 with Black Boots under the guidance of Sobukhazi coaches Mugariri Zhou and Sabina Shumba, who are set to benefit from the merger.
