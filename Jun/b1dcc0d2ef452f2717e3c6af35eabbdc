WARNING-SHOTS were fired early Sunday morning in Entumbane suburb in Bulawayo when security guards reacted to an attempted robbery and arrested two suspects at Nhliziyo Shopping Centre. <img class="alignnone wp-image-620101 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-67-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-67-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-67-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube confirmed the incident. The robbers are believed to have been targeting a Mukuru shop at the Centre. A resident, Mr Thulani Mpofu, who is a security guard but was off duty and lives near the shops, says he was awakened by the Safeguard security guard, Mr Samuel Nkomo who informed him about the presence of the robbers. Mr Mpofu said before the break-in, there were three suspicious vehicles that were driving up and down near the shops around midnight but they did not read much into it. “Mr Nkomo phoned his reaction team at Safeguard while I phoned my company Fawcett Security which operates an alarm system in one of the shops. Both reaction teams arrived in about 10 minutes in five vehicles and managed to barricade the area. We called the robbers to come down from a roof where they had climbed to get into the shop but they refused and the Safeguard security team fired some warning shots in the air. “One of them put up his hand and said he was surrendering while the other refused and pelted us with stones. We had to go up and bring him down,” he said. Mr Mpofu said the Safeguard Security Company team went to report the attempted robbery at Entumbane Police Station and they came back with two police officers. He said residents wanted to mete out instant justice on the robbers but the security guards stopped them. “As this was happening a black Honda Fit arrived making noise. I confronted one of the guys who came out of the car and while I was asking what they were doing, one of the police officers said I should let him go. We were shocked when we arrived at the police station and one of the robbers said the guy I confronted was in-fact one of them,” he said. Mr Mpofu said the same Honda Fit later arrived at the shops at around 9:30 am and the guys who were inside threatened the security guards for causing their colleagues arrest. “We got the vehicle’s number plate and forwarded it to the police,” he said. A director at the shop where the Mukuru facility is located, Miss Khaya Sibanda, said the weekend attempted robbery was the third at the shop. <img class="alignnone wp-image-620104 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-68-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-68-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-68-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A resident who witnessed the arrests but declined to be named said: “I was sleeping at home and I was awakened by the sound of gunshots. About five shots were fired and I heard someone saying “dubul’ikhanda” (shoot the head). The robbers were carrying a grinder which they probably wanted to use to open the safe. Residents beat them up but the security guys saved them. The two were taken to Entumbane Police Station,” he said. Insp Ncube said the two suspects are from Nkulumane and Mbundane suburbs. “Police in Bulawayo have arrested two male adults Agrippa Mloyi (39) of Nkulumane 5 and Dingilizwe Mloyi (44) of Mbundane Bulawayo for unlawful entry and theft. The case happened at Mlungu General Dealers Supermarket at Nhliziyo Shopping Centre, Entumbane. The two security guards on duty saw one unknown male adult wearing a green jacket and a pair of blue jeans at the back of the shop who ran away upon seeing them. They fired warning shots into the air but the accused ran away,” he said. He said two who were on top of the roof were arrested and a grinder 21V Li-Ion with a spare battery was found on top of the roof.  Insp Ncube urged the business community to use target hardening techniques by employing the services of reputable security companies. –@themkhust
