The Chronicle The Stewardship Test
This is a test that God brings to show us that we are just stewards of everything that we have. Luke 12:16-21 <img class="alignnone wp-image-621493 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-484.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-484.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-484-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’ “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’ “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.” There are some people who are rich on earth but they are not rich for God. This man had abundance in his land and he planned to expand his wealth but he did not know that night his soul would be required of him. Some people are poor in the physical but rich in the Spirit.  So you might be rich in the physical realm yet very poor in the Spirit. This rich man worked so hard only to leave his riches behind on earth. Abundance in the physical does not mean abundance in the Spirit. You do not own anything, this is wrong theologically, you do not own that house or $100 000 in your bank account, it is not yours. <img class="alignnone wp-image-621496 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-485.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-485.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-485-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> That house and that money belongs to God, you are only a steward. You only own what you have given to God because everything that you give to God will be rewarded to you in Heaven. This is a test that proves how strategically and generously we use what God has entrusted to us. You do not own that wife or that husband; you are just a steward of that man or woman. You are just a steward and God can take them away from you no matter how painful it is. So thank Him and know that everything belongs to Him and you are simply a steward of what you have in this life. God Bless . . . eaglelifeassembly@yahoo.com
