More than 200 fathers came together at Euphorie Events centre for the event that was organised by True Elegance Events in partnership with people in the diaspora who funded the event and bought presents that were presented to attendees. They were served with a four-course meal that comprised braai and beers for those who love alcohol. Entertainment was provided by Nkwali, Ezimnyama Dance Group and Thandanani Women’s Ensemble and the director of ceremonies was Ezra Tshisa Sibanda. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-619927" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-323.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-323.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-323-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dressed to the nines, the fathers were in suits and hats. They had beaming smiles all day as they danced to different music and entertainment. Some rolled back the years and showed off their dance skills. To ensure lasting memories, there was a photo booth where the dads posed for pictures. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-619930" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-324.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-324.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-324-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some dads had also invited their sons to celebrate with them. Highlanders Football Club legend Netsai Mpofu, who was among the fathers, said he appreciated that his children thought of him.  “It’s a great feeling to know that our children thought of us as fathers. “They gave us a moment to gather with other fathers as we celebrated being appreciated by our children. <img class="alignnone wp-image-619933 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-325.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-325.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-325-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Being a father isn’t easy and as such it is comforting when your kids remember and appreciate how you struggled to fend for them,” said Mpofu whose children are in the United Kingdom and was accompanied by his brother Martin, his son Keith and their in-laws. Another family, the Dongas made up of four fathers and their 96-year-old father were also part of the event. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-619936" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-326.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-326.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-326-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> One of the brothers, Never Donga said the day was special for them as they got to reunite as they stay in different places. They said it was an important day to bond with their father. Another father, Bigboy Ndlovu from Pumula South said the day was a reminder of the duties that a father should play in their children’s lives and those that depend on him. Organiser of the event, Patscencia Vundla, owner of True Elegance Events, Restaurants, Bar, Farm Tours and Spa services, said it was great to see fathers enjoying themselves.
