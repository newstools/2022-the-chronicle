On Thursday, the Eveline High School DREAMS club donated some winter foot wear and groceries to Ekuphumuleni Geriatric Nursing Home in Bulawayo’s Mzilikazi suburb. The donation comprised of 22 pairs of tennis shoes, 48 pairs of socks, toothpaste, toothbrushes, sugar, powdered milk, a crate of eggs and loaves of bread. The nursing home established more than 30 years ago, apart from taking care of the inmates at the institution, also takes care of the needs of ill elderly people around the city. It trains geriatric care aides and the community on how to care for the affected people as well as provide  home based care for the elderly. Eveline High School head girl who is also the DREAMS president, Mbalenhle Ncube said they decided to share the little they raised with the senior citizens. “As the DREAMS club of Eveline High School, this is our little way of remembering and appreciating the big role our senior citizens play in our upbringing. Some of us are beneficiaries of the DREAMS club under different organisations such as JF Kapnek, Childline and National Aids Council (Nac). <img class="alignnone wp-image-616294 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-11-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-11-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-11-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> They have done a lot for us such as paying our fees, buying stationery and making sure we have all the necessities we need. We have been empowered and in return we want to empower others around us,” she said. Ncube said as young people they want to uphold the spirit of Ubuntu, “I am because you are.” As Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said, “I am a person through other people. My humanity is tied to yours.” The spirit of ubuntu is essentially to be humane and ensure that human dignity is always at the core of your actions, thoughts, and deeds when interacting with others. Having ubuntu is showing care and concern for your neighbour,” she said. The school’s DREAMS vice-president, Ms Tawana Sibanda said the club is striving to rekindle the spirit of giving to the needy. “We decided to give to this home and we hope this will rekindle the flame of charity. They say charity begins at home and Bulawayo is home. Thus, we decided to start at home and spread to other areas,” she said. The school club’s patron, Mrs Nomathemba Mabona-Takabinga said the girls are beneficiaries of the DREAMS programme. She said the club members’ fees and other requirements such as sanitary wear and stationery are provided by DREAMS. “We have instilled the spirit of ubuntu hence these girls are coming with such great ideas to assist the needy in the community.  These girls are saying they appreciate the society’s concerns regarding the Girl Child which has seen them being assisted by DREAMS and they have decided to extend this helping hand to the senior citizens,” she said. Ekuphumuleni representative, Ms Miltah Nyathi thanked the girls for remembering the elderly especially this winter. “We thank you for remembering the elderly at such a time when they really need warm clothing,” she said.
