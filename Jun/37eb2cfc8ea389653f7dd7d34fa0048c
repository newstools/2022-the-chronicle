FOOTBALL stakeholders believe amendment of the Zifa constitution to be gender inclusive, allowing more women participation and trained personnel taking up leadership roles could lead to a reformation of the local game. Participants at a public consultative meeting organised by the Zifa Restructuring Committee in Bulawayo yesterday also called for junior development reforms to encourage clubs and academies to keep churning out talent. The Zifa Restructuring Committee chairman Blessing Rugara, international sports expert Tommy Sithole, ex-SRC Matabeleland provincial coordinator Brian Busani Moyo, Doves Holdings general manager marketing Joel Gombera, former Caps United administrator Joyce Kapota and former Caps United defender Charles Sibanda, engaged in discussions with Bulawayo-based football stakeholders at Milton Junior School. <img class="alignnone wp-image-617467 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rugara, a lawyer by profession, said his committee will compile their findings and make recommendations at the end of the consultative meetings. The SRC gave the restructuring committee a year to complete the mission and come up with a blueprint which is expected to chart a new chapter for local football. Rugara noted that from engagements they have had so far, burning issues are centred on administration, junior development, women’s football and equity in funding. <img class="alignnone wp-image-617470 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Response from stakeholders has been fantastic. People are enthusiastic about football and know what they want. The issues to do with administration where they argue that trained administrators are needed and nomination fees should be fair. They argue that administration should be supported by the constitution and new blood coming in shouldn’t be about the money, but knowledge to develop the game. People want a board that is gender inclusive, with women feeling they should be included in the Zifa council,” said Rugara. “They (stakeholders) want to see junior development continue to produce talent and at the same time want development funds from Fifa to cascade to real beneficiaries. People want to see a good football product from the Premiership and strong national teams that are selected on merit.”  In his contribution, former referee Thomas Khumalo said: “We’re losing a lot of very capable, non-corrupt people because now it’s the money voted into office. If Zifa is to succeed, we need people of substance; people who will go with knowledge to uplift the football. There is a need to find people with relevant experience sitting on committees.  It’s shocking to see someone who has never refereed in their life being part of the referees’ committee. That’s where corruption starts. If committees are to be successful, then we should have qualified personnel.” Seasoned women’s football administrator Elizabeth Langa was concerned that funds meant for women’s football are being diverted. “Zifa doesn’t support women’s national teams as girls are not treated equally like their male counterparts. Funds from Fifa meant for women’s football don’t get to their intended destination. There are lots of training funds from Fifa but we’re missing out because of inept leadership. There must also be a quota system within the Zifa board, maybe that way women’s voices will be heard,” Langa said. Zifa Bulawayo Province board member Madza Takawira took a swipe at the electoral process saying: “The electoral process creates cartels. It should be independent because you can’t have an electoral process that reports to the same board that is seeking office.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-617473 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-42-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-42-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-42-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mkhululi Mthunzi, a former head of junior football in Bulawayo said: “Fifa development funds should get to clubs and those funds must be used to train coaches who will help develop youngsters and the game. There should also be compensation for clubs that produce
players because it takes about seven years to nurture talent, which is a long time. To make sure that we continue producing players, those clubs should not lose players for free and let there be a way of making PSL teams pay compensation.” Sports journalist Lovemore Dube said there is a need to tap into the experience of former players and administrators to improve the game. He challenged Zifa and the SRC to deal with constituencies that only pop-up during the association’s elections.  “We’ve got so many organisations that spring to life on election season and stay off for years. Beach soccer and five-a-side football are not heard about for four years and yet they add to the confusion we see. We wish to see the SRC ensuring that these (five-a-side and beach soccer) are structured from zones to provincial level, not for purposes of elections, but for competitions,” Dube said. Shadreck Kutsanzira said: “The so-called administrators we have are not trained and they are the source of our football problems. We’ve got a number of Fifa/Caf trained administrators and instructors, but we are failing to make use of them. The last administration course we had was in 2017 and as aspiring administrators, that’s a long time. We need more training programmes. We need people assuming office positions to be trained so that they are conversant with dictates of administration.” – @ZililoR
