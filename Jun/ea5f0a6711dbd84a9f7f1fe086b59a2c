BULAWAYO’S Makokoba re-development project is primed for a major boost as it will be showcased to potential global investors when the local authority participates at the World Urban Forum in Katowice, Poland this month. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615699" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-103.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-103.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-103-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The urban expo is set for 26-30 June. The Bulawayo City Council has already developed a strategic plan to reposition itself as a “smart city” destination by 2024 and the re-development of Makokoba fits well into this thrust. Smart cities modelling thrives on increased citizen engagement and use of digital technologies among others to make councils more resilient and better able to respond to development challenges. In 2015 the local authority, with Government approval, sought to redevelop the sprawling oldest suburb in the city that is expected to see more than 17 000 people benefiting from increased housing space. With funding challenges standing in the way for the urban regeneration project to take off, the Poland urban expo presents an opportunity for the city to market and attract investors for the project. “The City of Bulawayo’s participation at the World Urban Forum is of paramount importance as it would present an opportunity to showcase the investment opportunities available in the city in terms of housing development and source potential investors for the Makokoba re-development project,” council said in its latest monthly report. The expo will afford Bulawayo and other local authorities to meet and connect with prospective partners, learn about new developments within the human settlements sector and also engage to obtain new ideas and learn from best practices. According to the council’s report, in March, the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities wrote to council indicating that in the preparatory meetings for the expo it has settled for two themes — new cities and urban regeneration concept. <img class="wp-image-615700 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-104.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-104.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-104-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Melfort Smart City Under new cities, focus would be on Mt Hampden New City, Melfort Smart City and Victoria Falls and Hwange Special Economic Zone.  Urban regeneration will zero in on Makokoba, Sakubva (Mutare), Mbare (Harare-Mukuvisi Corridor) and Chinotimba suburb in Victoria Falls. The Government will be participating at the World Urban Forum and for maximum impact four urban local authorities — Harare, Bulawayo, Mutare and Victoria Falls have been invited to participate. These will put up a joint exhibition with the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities. “There are various concepts developed for each of these projects. Some need to dust up while others are polished. “However, these need to be properly packaged to meet the international standards of exhibition so that we are able to attract investment,” read part of the ministry’s letter. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615702" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-105.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-105.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-105-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA), which has vast experience in international exhibitions has been roped in to put a solid presentation. The World Urban Forum is the world’s premier conference on urban issues. It was established in 2001 by the United Nations to examine one of the most pressing issues facing the world today, rapid urbanisation and its impact on communities, cities, economies, climate change and policies. Some of the objectives include raising awareness of sustainable urbanisation among stakeholders and constituencies, including the general public, improve the collective knowledge of sustainable urban development through inclusive open debates, sharing of lessons learned and the exchange of best practices and good policies. BCC in 2019 opened up tenders for contractors to come on board with plans on how they could redevelop the area. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615705 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-106.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-106.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-106-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The suburb has over the past experienced constant sewer pipe bursts, which result in effluent flowing in front of homes, exposing residents to water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid. In other old suburbs such as Iminyela and Mabutweni, residents are still using communal toilets. Recently, council indicated that it was engaging potential investors to bankroll various projects under the “smart city” concept, which has been endorsed by the private sector and the Government. The private sector has also joined in, focusing on raising capital to fund projects. In a bid to drive the smart city momentum, DEAT Capital has said it would be hosting a one-day engagement at the end of June under the theme: “Innovative financing solutions in the cities and rural communities’ ecosystem post-Covid-19 pandemic” in Harare to explore strategies for implementing the new concept. — @nqobilebhebhe
