The Chronicle LONDON – English Premiership football champions Manchester City are expecting to field an opening offer from Chelsea for Raheem Sterling after Thomas Tuchel engaged the England international over how he’d fit in at Stamford Bridge. The forward heads a shortlist of the manager’s attacking targets and enters the final year of his contract with the English Premier League champions, who are grateful for his service and will not obstruct his desire for greater minutes and status elsewhere. <img class="wp-image-621943 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-59-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-59-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-59-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thomas Tuchel Pep Guardiola has repeatedly stated “I don’t like to keep players that are unhappy” and is open to allowing Sterling’s exit this summer, even to a rival, on condition that an acceptable bid in the region of £50m is tabled. Tuchel is desperate to add a decisive edge in the final third to cure Chelsea’s goalscoring issues. Sterling would offer the German a guaranteed threat – he has directly contributed a combined 165 goals in the division in 320 appearances for Liverpool and City – as well as tactical flexibility and experience. <img class="wp-image-605883 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pep Guardiola The 27-year-old believes he is in the decisive phase of his career and wants to make a significant contribution on and off the pitch. He has held respectful discussions with City in this regard and a decision on his future will revolve around the influence he will be able to have  especially in the big matches. – Sky Sports.
