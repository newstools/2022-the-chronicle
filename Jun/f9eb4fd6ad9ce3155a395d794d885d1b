We are moving around Matabeleland South covering all districts, leaving no one behind. “These are going to be pass-on projects among wards in all districts. The district which benefited first in Matabeleland South is Umzingwane District,” said Cde Moyo. The poultry project will be passed on amongst all the 19 wards in Umzingwane. Umzingwane received broiler chicks and broiler feed as part of the project. <img class="wp-image-618814 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-40-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-40-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-40-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Broiler feed While reiterating the ruling party’s agenda of not living anyone behind, the national executive youth league member said the project will today be heading to Bulilima District.
