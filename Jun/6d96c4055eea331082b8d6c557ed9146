MATABELELAND South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Abedinico Ncube has met security officials and Gwanda councillors to find ways of clamping down on crime that is on the rise in the province. The minister called for collective efforts from various stakeholders in addressing crime which he said is prevalent in the province. This follows an outcry from Gwanda residents over the increase in crime in their district.
Residents from the mining town continue to be terrorised by criminals who are mainly suspected to be illegal gold panners operating in the area. The suspects will be armed machetes, axes, and knives among other weapons. <img class="wp-image-482333 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/machetes1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/machetes1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/machetes1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A machete They are responsible for rape, murder, attempted murder, robbery, assault and theft cases being recorded in the town. Some of the offences are committed in broad daylight making it difficult for people, especially women and children to move around alone in secluded areas. The offences are mainly recorded in the high-density suburbs but they have also moved to low density suburbs. Minister Ncube met with law enforcement agents and Gwanda Municipality councillors on Monday to discuss ways to fight crime. In an interview, Minister Ncube said people no longer feel safe to move around the streets and it was high time police took action. He said while the problem was prevalent in the mining town, crime was a concern throughout the province. <img class="wp-image-560448 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Gwanda-Residents-Association-deputy-secretary-general-Wellington-Nare.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Gwanda-Residents-Association-deputy-secretary-general-Wellington-Nare.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Gwanda-Residents-Association-deputy-secretary-general-Wellington-Nare-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gwanda Residents Association president Mr Wellington Nare “The reason I called for the meeting is because people are suffering. Police have to scale up their efforts in fighting crime. They have to increase their presence in all areas during the day and even more at night. Police also have to be on the alert so that when reports are made, they can react swiftly. There is no area which is no longer a crime hotspot in Gwanda Town,” he said. “People are not safe even if they are in their homes with their doors locked. People are being attacked on a daily basis by culprits. People are being robbed in their homes, shops, along the way as they move around. Women and children are being raped and lives are being lost. Some of these culprits are seen moving around but they are not being apprehended.” <img class="wp-image-614493 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-49.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-49.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-49-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Knives He said the prevalence of crime was a sign that people had lost their morality and no longer respected the sanctity of life. Cde Ncube said greed was now causing people to reap where they did not sow. He said there is also need for the public to work with the police by forming neighbourhood watch committees and disclosing crucial information. “In as much as the law enforcement agents have a crucial role to play in fighting crime so do other stakeholders. Members of the public should co-operate with police by providing any relevant information and participating in various community policing initiatives. The challenge is that some people shield these culprits thereby obstructing the course of justice,” said Cde Ncube.  He urged councillors to ensure that there are neighbourhood watch committees in all areas. Gwanda Residents Association secretary-general Mr Wellington Nare said residents have a desire to see more action from police than excuses. He said while resources were a challenge, police have to find a way to effectively fight crime to ensure protection of the public. – @DubeMatutu
