The Chronicle Tendai Rupapa in Bulawayo THERE were wild celebrations in Bulawayo yesterday when hundreds of women including ladies of the night, teen mothers, widows, child-headed families, the elderly, people with disabilities and youths, received certificates and starter-packs after a training in detergent-making courtesy of First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa’s all-encompassing, multi-pronged empowerment drive that is leaving no one and no place behind.

I am happy because of this project aimed at economically empowering us. I joined others to learn how to make detergents despite my old age. Do you see my grey hair? What the First Lady, Amai Mnangagwa has done for me is unprecedented. My hair is greying now and since birth I have never seen this kind of love. I don’t know whether I should cry or lift her up. I can’t walk, but with what I have learnt I will have a sound sleep knowing I now have a project that will help me look after my grandchildren. I have learnt to make detergents including dishwashing liquid hence my plates will be clean always from today. This project is not for me alone but many others who have also benefitted. May God bless you mwanangu,” she said. The graduates, who walked with a spring in their step following the training programme, were given starter-packs by Dr Mnangagwa to immediately start making the detergents and train others in their communities. So happy were the women that they sang praises to the mother of the nation, wishing her a long life. The First Lady brought along officials from the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development and the Women’s Bank who gave the women knowledge on their functions, financial literacy and how to expand their projects. <img class="size-full wp-image-612360" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Auxillia Mnangagwa Addressing the gathering, the First Lady said she had visited Bulawayo to celebrate with the graduates and hammered on the need for women countrywide to work hard while fostering unity and love in communities. “I have come here to celebrate with those who have completed training in detergent making in Bulawayo Metropolitan Province. It is my wish that the significance of this training programme improves the livelihoods of the citizens of this province and the country at large. Ladies and gentlemen detergent manufacturing training has proven to be a crucial initiative by my office towards the attainment of Vision 2030  “My visits from previous provinces are across the country certified that this training has yielded positive results which are citizen-friendly. Ladies and gentlemen, we always say if you empower a woman you have empowered the whole nation and you are the women who have been empowered today. Therefore this project has benefited women in several ways that is reducing rural-urban migration, curtail dependency syndrome, promote income generation, create employment, improve the standard of living and enhance skills development, resulting in reduced early marriages.” The First Lady decried some cultural practices which disadvantaged girls in terms of access to education. “The struggle women face right from being a child is unimaginable. Little girls are denied education while their brothers don’t encounter such denial. The reason for this seems futile as families presume the role of women is in the kitchen and she should only take care of household work. Pane iyi tirikuti vabereki vedu kudhara vaiti havadzidzisi mwanasikana, mumwe uchava pfambi, mumwe uchashaiwa, hauna zvaunotibatsira pamusha and these are the names we were given as we grew up while shying away from sending us to school. So there are some among us who failed to proceed with their education because of these challenges,” she said to applause. <img class="size-full wp-image-617944" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Women’s-Bank.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Women’s-Bank.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Women’s-Bank-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Women Microfinance Bank The mother of the nation implored women to take advantage of the ministry and the Women’s Bank to ensure they succeed in their ventures. “They are saying if you come to us they will assist you even in the writing of proposals. All they want to see is you doing something that helps your family. Women are also capable of contributing to sustainable development and quality of life. So I encourage everyone here present to be at least a member of a community centre or club not only to enjoy the benefits of this graduation but also to disseminate knowledge and information about the lessons learnt to other women who belong to your socio-economic status for their economic upliftment. You should also to act as leaders of society to raise a voice against women violence, expectation in household as well as in the workplace. We want women with leadership qualities and entrepreneurial skills rather than being captivated in the kitchen. Let me conclude by saying as Zimbabwean women lets unite and work together for the betterment of our nation,” she said emphatically. Mrs Lydia Ndlovu danced and ululated for being accorded a chance to learn and be equipped with skills. <img class="size-full wp-image-617830" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/first-lady-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/first-lady-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/first-lady-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Part of the detergent making starter packs donated by Angel of Hope Foundation to the women to kickstart their project in Bulawayo yesterday “Were it not for the First Lady’s benevolence, would we have achieved this. She is God-sent and may the good Lord bless her for us,” she said. Miss Diana Bhebhe, who was left to take care of her siblings after the death of her parents was on cloud nine. “She is a mother for all of us. She remembers everyone including us her orphans. This training she has given us will certainly unlock bigger opportunities for us. We are going to become successful businesswomen because she has given us a stepping stone. One day we will invite her to come and see where this project would have taken us,” she said while wiping away tears of joy. Mrs Martha Maphosa, a single mother, punched the air with excitement and happiness. <img class="size-full wp-image-617827" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/first-lady-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/first-lady-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/first-lady-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some of the beneficiaries of Angel of Hope Foundation detergents making training programme celebrate after their training in Bulawayo yesterday “I am a single mother who raises her children alone and I thank the First Lady for the project that she has initiated for us.

We wish to thank you Mama for the good work that you do in this country and the fact that you are not selective. You have uplifted us as women,” she said. Mrs Maphosa said if it were others in higher offices, they would remain in their offices, but Amai Mnangagwa was different as she travels around the country to meet and help the people. <img class="size-full wp-image-594958" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Judith-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Judith-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Judith-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Judith Ncube Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube praised the First Lady for doing wonders in her area of jurisdiction and the country at large. “Today is a special day with a special purpose. We are starting something new. Something exciting that is the skills training programmes for women and youths which is being spearheaded by umama our First Lady umama uAuxillia Mnangagwa.
