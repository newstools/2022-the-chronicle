This track basically talks about love vibes. It generally seeks to spread some love with its hook which goes ‘give me your love, baby put it on me’. It’s a fusion of Afro-beat and Amapiano and people are going to hear a bit of Amapiano and Afro-beat. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615537 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Da-Kudu-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Da-Kudu-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Da-Kudu-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I can say it’s a great piece of work coming from a collaboration of great artists so I advise fans to brace themselves for a banger,” Da Kudu said. “The video was shot in Cowdray Park and Burnside.
