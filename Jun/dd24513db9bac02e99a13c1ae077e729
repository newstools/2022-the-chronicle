The Chronicle Genesis 2:24:
 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” THERE are letters that I used to write to my wife when we were still in courtship, 20 years ago and I read a few on my wedding anniversary on https://www.facebook.com/drprbsc/videos/1163384814170690. In one of them I was teaching her the power of sowing a seed for our marriage because all things in our blood which are generational will be waiting for one moment and that is the moment of marriage. Things that you were taking lightly, anger, lust or poverty begin to reinforce themselves in marriage. Most of these things lie low and when you get married they start to rise very vivaciously, that is why couples struggle with a lot of things  If you had loneliness, it becomes stronger when you are married and most couples can confirm that certain behaviours are beyond their control. Demons attack marriages in a strong way. When they give a fist against your marriage be sure it’s a strong one. That is why when an attack comes it can cause serious fights or divorce and there is a lot of witchcraft released by witches against marriages. When throwing missiles most witches will be attacking marriages. Murderers, adulterers and most bad behaviours were manufactured in the warehouse called marriage. That is why it is the devil’s favourite area to attack. Therefore, before you enter into a marriage; Seek knowledge about marriage and equip yourself through counselling. Sow a seed to be protected from all missiles attacking marriage. <img class="wp-image-613471 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/civil-marriagesqa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/civil-marriagesqa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/civil-marriagesqa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> marriage Pray, fast and read the Word. Maintain holiness in your relationship. The last thing is when you begin your marriage, let it be founded on tithing because the devourer (Malachi 3:10) does not just devour money but marriages as well. If you found your marriage on the Word of God your marriage will last but if you found it on a wrong thing you will continue to go for marriage counselling. God Bless…
