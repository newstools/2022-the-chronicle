GOVERNMENT has fulfilled its promise to the community of Ward 1 in Mangwe District as it has allocated $14 million towards repairing Fakanye Dam, which is a major source of water for the area. Major works include repairing the dam wall and construction of a spillway. The community sent a plea to Government during a visit by DDF permanent secretary, Mr Christopher Shumba late last year, appealing for assistance in repairing and desilting the dam which was damaged by rains. <img class="alignnone wp-image-618793 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-37-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-37-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-37-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Shumba visited the dam as part of his tour to assess infrastructure development projects in Matabeleland South province. He assured villagers that Government will treat rehabilitation and repair of the dam as a matter of urgency. Government came in at a time when villagers were mobilising resources to repair the dam wall but their funds were limited. Fakanye Dam is a major source of water for more than eight villages. The dam supplies the community with water for both domestic use and irrigation as they grow various vegetables in nutrition gardens. The dam is also a source of water for villagers’ livestock. <img class="wp-image-615718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock In an interview, DDF Matabeleland South provincial co-ordinator Mr Moment Malandu said repairing the dam would come first then desiltation would follow. He said the target was for all works to be completed by end of September in preparation for the rainy season. Major works started at the beginning of this month under the second phase of the 100 day cycle.  “Works to rehabilitate Fakanye Dam are underway. Government has so far allocated $14 million towards the project and we expect more funds as we progress. The works which are underway include verge clearing on the dam wall and excavations which are now at 45 percent. The outstanding works include construction of guide walls, dam wall patching, stone grouting and spillway construction,” he said. “Villagers are assisting with labour to carry out the works. We hope to have finished works to repair the dam by end of September in preparation for the rainy season.” <img class="wp-image-610447 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rainfall.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rainfall.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rainfall-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rain A villager, Ms Sinikiwe Dube said rehabilitation of the dam was a huge relief as it meant water challenges will be a thing of the past. She said she was present during the visit by DDF permanent secretary Mr Shumba and she was among villagers that had appealed for Government’s intervention. Ms Dube said she was pleased that Government had delivered on its promise. “It is a delight to see works of rehabilitating the dam taking shape. We were using the dam all along even if it was silted but it was damaged during the rains which made the situation even worse. We rely on the dam for domestic use and irrigation. It also provides water for our livestock. We tried in our own capacity to mobilise funds but the project is too big and there is a lot of work that needs to be done,” she said. “Government promised and we are glad that it has delivered on its promise to assist us with the project. This is a clear indication that we have a listening Government.” <img class="wp-image-618802 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-38-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-38-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-38-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Desilting Another villager, Mrs Nobukhosi Ngwenya said they will be able to revive small gardens now that their dam would be repaired. She said the dam was no longer holding much water because of the damaged wall. Ward 1 Councillor in Mangwe, Mr Bernard Tshuma said once the dam was rehabilitated it would support a number of livelihood projects for the villagers. He said it has been difficult for farmers to run various projects as the river is no longer holding much water. Mr Tshuma said villagers also needed assistance in desilting the dam so that it could return to its original storage capacity. “This dam plays a huge role in the community as eight villages rely on it. The dam dries up quickly because it’s heavily silted. We thank Government that there is now progress in rehabilitating the dam and we pray that soon it will be desilted. If this dam is restored to its original state it can sustain households and projects throughout the year,” he said. – @DubeMatutu
