Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi revealed this in the National Assembly on Wednesday during the Question-and-Answer session. The minister was responding to written question by Matabeleland South MDC-Alliance Proportional Representative Mrs Sipho Mokone. Mrs Mokone had asked how Government was dealing with the overcrowding at Gwanda Prison. Minister Ziyambi said Government was concerned with crowding in the country’s prisons and is taking necessary steps to address the problem.  “My ministry, as the parent ministry, is aware of the overcrowding in our prisons and the challenges that come with it, which include lack of adequate and appropriate space for detained mental patients, compromised ventilation, drug supplies and deployment of health personnel, failure to provide inmates with a balanced diet as per dietary scale, general shortage of inmates’ clothing and bedding for inmates, amongst others,” said Minister Ziyambi. He said the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services, together with the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works completed the first phase which involved a visit to the proposed farm site. <img class="wp-image-480406 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Zimbabwe-Prisons-and-Correctional-Services.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Zimbabwe-Prisons-and-Correctional-Services.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Zimbabwe-Prisons-and-Correctional-Services-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services “The second phase will be done in June whereby the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works will revisit the proposed farm site and come up with designs for the  proposed prison.” Minister Ziyambi said the funding required for the project will be determined by architectural drawings that will be completed at the end of the month. “We are therefore waiting for the drawings and recommendations which we expect to receive at the end of this month,” he said.
