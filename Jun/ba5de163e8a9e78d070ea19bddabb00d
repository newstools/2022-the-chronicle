Ten groups will take to the stage to battle for a spot at the national finals and these are Dzimbabwe, Ivhu Inhaka, Dzorirangoma, Dare Rimwe, Jeketera, Matande, Musa, Guhudza, Muturikwa and Muhuru. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) Masvingo provincial arts manager Helen Mudefi said rainmaking dances are topping the type of dances to be showcased on Saturday. <img class="wp-image-616042 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Arts Council of Zimbabwe “Most of the traditional dance groups this year will showcase rainmaking dances, mhande, matendera and majukwa. However, some are into bira and sadhiwesi dance. Maybe others will change during final registration to avoid competition and register other types of dances,” she said. Mudefi said preparations for the finale are at an advanced stage with groups hard at work ahead of the competition. “Preparations are almost done with adjudicators having been contracted. There’s one from Manicaland, another from Zaka and one from Mashava who are trained seasoned traditional dance experts,” she said.  The winner from Masvingo is set to join nine others from the country’s provinces where they will compete for the national spot. So far, Jerusalema/Mbende outfit, Goromonzi Arts ensemble and Dedza Chitandizo from Mashonaland East and Harare provinces respectively have secured slots at the national final. The groups both walked away US$2 500 richer with another US$2 500 up for grabs for winners in Masvingo. After the Masvingo competition, Gwanda will play host to the Matabeleland South finals at the Manz’amnyama Beerhall next week Saturday. Thereafter, Gweru and Bulawayo will host their finals at Zaire Cocktail Bar and Manor Hotel on July 2 and July 9 respectively. Victoria Falls is set to host the Matabeleland North finals at Chinotimba Beerhall on July 16 with Mashonaland Central set to close the provincial competitions on July 16. <img class="wp-image-616036 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Delta Beverages The date and venue for the national final are yet to be unveiled with organisers, Delta Beverages, saying they will do so during the course of the competition. — @mthabisi_mthire
