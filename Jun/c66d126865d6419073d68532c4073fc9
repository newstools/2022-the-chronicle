SPRINTER Ngoni Makusha ran a season’s best time of 10,29 seconds in the 100m semi-finals at the Africa Senior Championships in Mauritius yesterday, but it was not enough to send him to the finals of the event.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615793" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-121.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-121.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-121-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> His previous best time was 10,30 seconds. He had earlier run his heat in 10,31 seconds. Another hopeful in the 100m dash was Dickson Kamungeremu, but he clocked 10,48 seconds, which wasn’t enough to go beyond the heats. In the 400m heats, Simon Artwell finished in 47,27 seconds, which wasn’t good enough to progress. The continental meet will end on Sunday and is being contested by more than 600 athletes in track and field events.  Zimbabwe fielded athletes in the 100m, 200m, 400m, 100m hurdles and 4x100m relay. Makusha will now try his luck in the 200m, 400m and the 4x100m relay team together with Tapiwa Makarawu, Garren Muwishi and Dickson Kamungeremu. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615796" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-122.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-122.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-122-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The African Championships presents athletes with an opportunity to qualify for the World Athletics Championships scheduled for next month in the United States.
