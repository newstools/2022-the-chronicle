Council chief executive officer Mr Farayi Machaya said the local authority will prioritise ongoing projects to ensure that most projects are completed before embarking on new ones. This comes as the council received $9 million in March out of an allocated $416 million for 2022. “We have channelled most of our devolution fund towards rehabilitation of the health and education sectors where we are carrying out a number of projects. Most of the projects have been completed in the health sector but as of now we have  where we engaged a new contractor to complete the outstanding works. Most of the work has been completed and we are now installing the ceiling,” he said. Another project is the Langton Clinic which is also at an advanced stage of completion with ceiling and roofing being completed. “Council has also pegged Kotamayi Clinic in Ward 5.  And very soon construction will be in progress as we seek to improve health service delivery in the district,” said Mr Machaya. In the education sector, Zibagwe RDC has since completed the construction of a classroom block at Hunters Secondary School while mobilisation for material for the science block is in progress. <img class="wp-image-613407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Unicef “The school secured the bulk of the building material from Unicef under the Global Complimentary Funding Programme. As a council we are coming in to fund labour and outstanding material through devolution funds. A borehole has since been drilled in the school yard since water was a challenge and we are expecting the contractor to be on the ground anytime,” said Mr Machaya. At Bharamasvosve Primary School, another classroom block and a teachers’ house have been completed, same as the fencing of the school yard. <img class="wp-image-608809 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Borehole-drilling-rig.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Borehole-drilling-rig.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Borehole-drilling-rig-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Drilling of a borehole: Photo Credit: iStockphoto Council is now in the process of drilling a borehole at the school to ease water shortages for pupils and the community.
