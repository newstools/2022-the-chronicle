To keep the genre alive in the country, Ligwena Music recently released the Khambana EP which has tracks, Mulilo, Vho Masindi, Athina Mulalo and Ngomalungundu.  One of the band members, Christen Mirror said they are doing well as the support from locals is amazing. “Bolo House Music is a fast-growing genre in Beitbridge. To ensure that we appeal to the market, we’re continuously releasing music in the genre. Producing music in that genre has paid off as we’re now recognised as some of the pioneers of the genre locally,” said Christen Mirror. He said the album that was produced by Mark Geezo is laced with different messages. “The EP tackles the daily challenges that people face and relationships. It also seeks to showcase the TshiVenda rap game in the country,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire
