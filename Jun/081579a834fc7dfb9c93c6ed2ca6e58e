The projects include roads, dams, schools, health facilities and irrigation schemes. The construction of Lake Gwayi-Shangani is among the big national projects that Government is funding. The new company is therefore coming at the most opportune time when its machinery and equipment is needed for such big projects including the Government’s Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme (ERRP) that targets major roads rehabilitation in cities and towns. The reconstruction of roads is an economic enabler and a driver towards the attainment of the Government’s Vision of an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.
