GOVERNMENT has intensified strategies to improve the country’s education system with plans underway to establish specialised technical secondary schools countrywide next year. <img class="wp-image-614584 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 Various challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic exposed shortcomings in the country’s education system, including the need to be innovative and produce learners that can be useful to industry and help contribute towards the country’s development agenda. In light of this, Government is heavily investing in school infrastructure development, alternative learning facilities and teacher capacitation to ensure that no child is left behind. Initially there will be one specialised technical school in each province. Speaking at the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) conference here last week, Deputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Edgar Moyo said it is imperative for Government to create an enabling environment that guarantees equal access to education by all children. “As part of the development of the competence-based curriculum, we are looking at moving a gear up by establishing 10 technical schools which are going to be highly technical and well-equipped. “We want to move away from the generalised education system of learning to a more practical method characterised by hands-on training. There will be one school for each province for a start and these are going to be the nucleus and more will be added later,” said Deputy Minister Moyo.  The technical schools will have highly competent teachers to drive the technical aspect of education in practical subject learning areas so that schools produce people who can be useful to industry. Deputy Minister Moyo said work is underway to identify suitable schools in each province while new infrastructure will be constructed in future as the concept will be spread to many learning institutions. “The initial concept will be driven through existing infrastructure in our provinces but then the idea is to construct schools. We will be rolling this out next year and now we are identifying schools with appropriate infrastructure,” he said. <img class="wp-image-604144 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> VICE-President and Minister of Health and Child Care Retired General Dr Costantino Chiwenga Vice-President Dr Costantino Chiwenga who is also Health and Child Care Minister officially opened the conference. In a speech read on his behalf by his deputy Dr John Mangwiro, he said the Government recognises that education is key in the human capital development. He congratulated the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education for introducing a number of initiatives to make sure learning is not continuously disrupted and these include online learning, radio and TV lessons, self-study guides, non-formal education and compression of the syllabus The education sector was one of the worst affected by the pandemic which disrupted lessons while some learning institutions, mostly boarding schools at some point recorded high positive cases of Covid-19 cases. Government responded to the pandemic by introducing a raft of measures including lockdowns, in an effort to reduce the rate of transmission. <img class="wp-image-619489 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-19-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-19-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-19-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Development Strategy (NDS1) “This is the way to go if we are to ensure the continuity of learning for our children and as such efforts are being made to put in place relevant infrastructure in schools in order to accommodate every learner including those living with disabilities in line with National Development Strategy (NDS1). The conference which is being attended by close to 900 school heads, ends today under the theme: “Education through and beyond Covid-19.” Dr Chiwenga encouraged educators and learners to get vaccinated as the country moves towards achieving herd immunity. — @ncubeleon
