Creatives are out to save communities from the loud noise that emanates from loud music during festivities through the introduction of silent disco events. A silent disco or silent rave is an event where people dance to music listened to on wireless headphones. Rather than using a speaker system, music is broadcast via a radio transmitter with the signal being picked up by wireless headphone receivers worn by the participants.  Kudzayi Chibvongodze, founder of the Virtual Reality & Silent Disco Village is one of the slowly emerging technology enthusiasts who has embarked on a mission to virtualise parties through the silent disco. At these events, all participants will be wearing headphones with DJs playing music live as the headphones receive the signal via the radio waves. The music is only audible to those with headphones. This virtual partying is similar to the virtual tours and gaming that are slowly gaining popularity. This weekend, Chibvongodze and his team are hosting their third event at Matopos National Park with the crew partnering with popular DJ Ryan Synth. <img class="size-full wp-image-504762" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Matobo-National-Park-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Matobo-National-Park-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Matobo-National-Park-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matobo National Park Chibvongodze said the virtual party is just like any other normal event except that music will be coming out of headphones and not the usual speakers. “Everyone will be wearing headphones enjoying music, food, drinks, and most importantly nature. The DJ will be playing live and the headphones receive signals via the radio waves. Listeners get to choose which channel they want to listen to just by the click of the button on the headphone.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-533649 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/beer.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/beer.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/beer-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said this comes with noise reduction benefits in communities, especially in national parks. “The benefit of the radio waves is that it’s real-time, so you can broadcast to hundreds of silent disco headphones using your transmitter. The advent of this technology has enabled the reduction in noise pollution as individuals experience the sound via headsets,” said Chibvongodze.
