NEW Highlanders’ head coach Baltemar Brito’s romance with the club is less than a month old, but the Brazilian-born gaffer is already overwhelmed with the love he has received from the club and its supporters. <img class="wp-image-616351 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-189.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-189.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-189-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders FC Brito will be in charge of his first assignment in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against army side Black Rhinos at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday.

The country does not have facilities like other countries I have coached before, but despite the limitations, I found people that are very kind and welcoming,” said Brito. “The people are lovely.  The willingness from the board and players is more important than a good field to train on. From the first day we arrived, people from this great city of Bulawayo were full of love for us. We are loving being here a lot. In the streets people stop us to take selfies and we are honoured. We are loving the food and the people.” He said his main target during the two-week mid-season break had given him an opportunity to build the Highlanders identity. “If the players show the attitude they have displayed at training, I think we will be content with finishing the rest of the season with this squad. We need to watch the boys in game situations before we can think of getting other players. “During the break, we tried to build the identity of the team that the fans will go out to the stadium to watch and appreciate. We know the process is not a two-week process, but we are already in that process of bringing that identity. Our feeling is that we are on the right path. Also, some players that were injured have recovered. We have a clean bill of health for the next game.” <img class="wp-image-477117 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Highlanders-fans-at-Barbourfields-Stadium.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Highlanders-fans-at-Barbourfields-Stadium.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Highlanders-fans-at-Barbourfields-Stadium-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders fans at Barbourfields Stadium Brito called on fans to come in their numbers for Sunday’s tie. “I invite the fans to come in their numbers to watch the game. They are the 12th player and have a role to play in our mission to awaken the giant. The fans can expect a team that wants to play well; a team that is showing the hunger to win from the first minute. The fans will like the way the team will play and the personality that will be shown by the players,” Brito said.
