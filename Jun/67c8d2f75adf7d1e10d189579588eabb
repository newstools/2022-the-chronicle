BULAWAYO Chiefs and Western Rangers were the biggest winners in the third-round of the Southern Region Division One Women’s League played last weekend. Pumula South-based Rangers walloped Highlanders Royals 7-0, while Chiefs put nine past a hapless Street Set without reply. Five goals by Shylet Machonesa and one each by Tatenda Gambiza and Tendai Shava were enough to see the Godwin Moyo-coached Rangers whack Bosso.  Chiefs got their goals through Last Mlalazi (3), Patience Ndlovu (2), Lauryn Mupasi (1), Nomqhele Donga (1), Tatenda Mudiwa (1) and an own goal. Hat-trick heroine Last Mlalazi was unstoppable, as she scored her first goal of the afternoon followed by Patience Ndlovu, who scored two quick-fire goals in a space of five minutes. Amakhosikazi went to half-time holding a commanding lead and when action resumed in the second-half, the visitors seemed intent on fighting their way back into the match, but their efforts came to nought as Mlalazi added her second and Chiefs’ fifth in the 49th minute. The Evans Netha-coached side continued to dominate and added three more goals through Nomqhele Donga, Mlalazi and Tatenda Mudiwa. In other league matches, Entumbane Queens beat New Orleans 2-0, while Las Palmas and Lobengula Queens played to a goalless draw, as did Bulawayo Queens and Black Boots. ZRP Bulawayo put three past Ubuntu Queens to round off the weekend’s fixtures. On Saturday, the league enters the fourth-round of games with Chiefs away to Black Boots in Fairbridge, while Rangers are at home to Entumbane Queens at Emarolini Ground in Pumula South. New Orleans take on Bulawayo Queens at Matshayiskhova Primary School in New Luveve, with Lobengula City Queens at home against Highlanders Royals at New Lobengula Rugby Ground. ZRP Bulawayo host Las Palmas at Ross Camp, while Lee Mangena and his Street Set play host to Ubuntu Queens at Mambo Ground in Tshabalala. — @RealSimbaJemwa
