Mr Chikwekwe said the council has an obligation to provide quality service to residents who pay bills every month. “The residents who are the ratepayers should realise value for their money,” he said. Meanwhile, Gweru residents have applauded the signing of the performance based contracts saying they look forward to improved service delivery. Gweru Residents and Ratepayers Association (GRRA) executive director Mr Cornelius Selipiwe said performance based contracts will ensure all workers perform to expectations. “Council is able to appraise its workers at any given time guided by the contracts and this will push workers to do their best to meet set targets,” he said. Gweru Residents Forum director, Mr Charles Mazorodze concurred, adding that resources must be availed to enable directors to meet expectations. “This is a good move to improve service delivery and ensure that council retains only good performers,” he said. Mr Mazorodze said there is need to strike a balance between the introduction of performance based contracts and availing the necessary resources.
