FORMER Highlanders’ midfielder Winston Mhango is on the verge of joining Castle Lager Premier Soccer League side ZPC Kariba, Chronicle Sport can reveal. <img class="wp-image-593509 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Nqobizitha-Masuku.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Nqobizitha-Masuku.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Nqobizitha-Masuku-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nqobizitha Masuku Mhango arrived in the resort town on Monday and immediately trained with his potential paymasters the following morning. “I started training with the rest of ZPC Kariba players on Tuesday after I was called by the team’s head coach Rodwell Dhlakama and his assistant Darlington Dodo. I’m very much confident that I will soon sign a contract,” said Mhango yesterday. <img class="wp-image-606334 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rodwell-Dhlakama-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rodwell-Dhlakama-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rodwell-Dhlakama-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rodwell Dhlakama Mhango (33) previously played for Hwange and FC Platinum before joining Zambian side Kabwe Warriors after being lured by ex-FC Platinum coach Tenant Chilumba. After his stint in Zambia, he joined Bosso, but was released in March when the Bulawayo giants promoted Darlington Munkuli and Archford Faira from their developmental side Bosso 90. <img class="wp-image-575071 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Darlington-Dodo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Darlington-Dodo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Darlington-Dodo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Darlington Dodo Mhango seemed to be struggling with his game at Bosso and only made one league appearance before being let go. He had fallen down the pecking order, with on-fire Bosso vice-captain Nqobizitha Masuku and Adrian Silla forming a formidable central midfield partnership. Mhango is expected to play alongside other veterans Newman Sianchali and Brian Juru, among others, at ZPC Kariba. — @FungaiMuderere
