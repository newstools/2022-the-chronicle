ZIMBABWEAN tennis ace Tadiwa Eunice Mauchi says she is using the ongoing Cranrid International Tennis Federation (ITF) Under-18 South Central Circuit tournament as part of preparations for the Billie Cup to be held in Montenegro this month. Tanya Midzi, Tsitsi Mahere and Sasha Chimedza are also taking part in the Cranrid ITF Under-18 South Central Circuit that started at Bulawayo Country Club yesterday.

I have been out for months, so it’s good for me to get some matches. I played at the Billie Jean Cup last year and had some great matches. “Such tournaments show you where you are as a player. I have my goals, but I don’t want to put myself under pressure by talking of expectations before the tournament. I just want to play, win and improve my rankings,” said Mauchi. She is ranked 596th on the ITF juniors rankings. Mauchi progressed to the second-round of the ongoing tournament after beating Zahara Elzen 6-0, 6-1 in the first-round yesterday. Last week, Bulawayo hosted the South Central Zim Leg 1. <img class="wp-image-613542 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />   Sophia Fuller and Tadiwanashe Mauchi Although the local boys struggled in the singles, failing to go beyond the first round, Tanya Midzi had a good outing and battled to the final which she lost to South African Celina Joseph 6-3, 2-6, 3-6.
