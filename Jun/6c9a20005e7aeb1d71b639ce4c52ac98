The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter ARTS promoter Handsome “Handy” Sibanda has expressed his desire to combine two of the country’s up-and-coming talented vocalists Muntuza and Andrea The Vocalist for what he believes will be the “best collaboration of the year”. <img class="wp-image-606712 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Maphorisa Muntuza who hails from Zimnyama Village in Plumtree caught the attention of people, some from as far as South Africa through social media with his powerful voice and guitar-playing skills. This was through the track Nhliziyo Yami which he worked on alongside Sobancane. For Andrea The Vocalist, the story is the same as the musician from the resort city of Victoria Falls also captured people with his vocals on the song Uhambo that has since been remixed by South Africa’s Aubrey Qwana. DJ Maphorisa has also expressed interest in working with him. <img class="wp-image-617155 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Aubrey Qwana Ever since people discovered them, the artistes have been receiving tremendous support from different spheres as people want to ensure that their talents soar.
