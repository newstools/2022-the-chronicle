The Chronicle Bulawayo is again witnessing an upsurge in armed robberies especially in the western suburbs where the robbers are terrorising residents.  People now live in fear of these robbers who break into houses at night demanding money and other valuables.
What is worrying is that the robbers are attacking their victims and in some cases even killing them. Last week, Mr Langelihle Dube (53) from Lobengula West suburb, was killed by a machete-wielding gang at his house. What is comforting is that the police have since arrested eight of the 13 machete-wielding robbers that have been terrorising residents in different suburbs at night and recovered a lot of stolen property including cars. <img class="size-full wp-image-617127" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/police.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/police.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/police-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZRP Bulawayo spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube shows some of the recovered property, mostly television sets and the weapons used during robberies, at the central police station. Police also recovered weapons that include machetes, knobkerries, hacksaws, bolt cutters, golf clubs and knives. The arrests, police said, were as a result of information provided by members of the public. Some of the victims of the robberies who were called to the identification parade at Bulawayo Central Police Station said they were now living in fear after being terrorised by the robbers. They said the robbers were breaking into their houses at night and robbing them of property that include household furniture, cellphones and cash. In cases where the victims have cars, the robbers load the stolen property into the victims’ cars and later dump the cars. <img class="size-full wp-image-617139" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Bulawayo-Central-Police-Station.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Bulawayo-Central-Police-Station.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Bulawayo-Central-Police-Station-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Central Police Station Residents said they are having sleepless nights as a result of increased armed robberies hence the need for stepped up police patrols at night. The safest place for any family, we have said before, is their house which unfortunately is no longer the case in Bulawayo. What is disturbing is that the armed robbers have become so daring to the extent of breaking down doors in full glare of their victims. The victims have told of harrowing experiences at the hands of the robbers who have killed or injured some of their victims.
Many of the children who have been victims of the robberies have been left traumatised. Residents should therefore work closely with the police in order to rid their areas of these robbers. <img class="size-full wp-image-483066" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/machete-gangs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/machete-gangs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/machete-gangs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Machete The eight robbers that have been arrested are from Bulawayo which means they have been living in the communities they terrorise at night. We have said before that criminals live in communities and the onus is on the residents to smoke them out by reporting them to the police. Criminals should not be allowed free rein in our city hence the need for each and every citizens to assist in fighting crime. It is unfortunate that residents in Western suburbs are reluctant to participate in neighbourhood watch committees which have proved very effective in the low density suburbs. We want to call on residents to assist the police to patrol their respective areas especially at night.
