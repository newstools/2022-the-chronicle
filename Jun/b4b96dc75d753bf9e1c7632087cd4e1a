The tournament will be played according to the blackball rule. The referee’s decision will be final in all instances. No negotiations will be entertained except with the referee after which his decision is final,” said Zipa president Ephraim Choto. He said the draw will be done once and the king of the tables will meet either in the semis or in finals. “Once the draw has been made and play has started, players shall ensure that they are available. A player not present will be given three minutes after which the frame is awarded to the player available. After six minutes the full game is awarded to the player available if the player does not arrive on the table within six minutes from the start of the game,” said Choto.  He said under their dress code, shorts, gumboots or slippers are not allowed and any player that turns up wearing them will automatically lose the game.
