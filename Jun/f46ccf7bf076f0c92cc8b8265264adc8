HIGHLANDERS has been found guilty of missile throwing by their fans in their abandoned Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium on April 23 and were fined US$6 000. FC Platinum have been awarded three points for the match on a 3-0 score line. Highlanders tweeted the guilty verdict last night. <img class="wp-image-560031 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Peter-sa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Peter-sa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Peter-sa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Peter Muduhwa The game was abandoned after 84 minutes amid chaotic scenes resulting in police firing tear smoke into the stands. FC Platinum and Highlanders were deadlocked 1-1 when second assistant referee Albinos Zigwati signalled a penalty adjudging that Bosso central defender Peter Muduhwa had fouled FC Platinum substitute Walter Musona inside the box although TV replays showed that there was minimal contact outside the box. <img class="wp-image-602974 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-47-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-47-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-47-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandava Stadium Bosso players mobbed referee Kuzivamwari Jaravaza protesting the decision and the lengthy delay agitated their supporters who invaded the pitch before being cleared by the police. Just when it appeared as if the match would resume, police threw teargas into the terraces triggering mayhem as fans fled in all directions.  Players and officials were also affected by the tear smoke forcing the referee to abandon the game. The decision to award FC Platinum three points now places them joint second with Dynamos on the league table on 34 points, just one point behind leaders Chicken Inn. This has firmly thrust the Zvishavane side in the title race, as Chicken Inn and Dynamos have been inconsistent performers. Meanwhile, FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza and his forward Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya have scooped the May PSL accolades. <img class="wp-image-594973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders Mapeza is coach of the month, while Ngwenya is the player of the month. The defending champions, who did not have a good start in defending their title, are on a healthy recovery path. The Zvishavane side was unbeaten in the four league matches they played last month, dispatching troubled Caps United 3-0, Yadah (2-0), Triangle (4-0) and Cranborne Bullets (1-0). Mapeza initially received the stick from critics for releasing a number of senior players before the beginning of the season, but he seems to have finally struck the right chord with his young side. <img class="wp-image-526162 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  FC Platinum Ngwenya is one of the youngsters that have repaid the coach’s faith in young players and has been a revelation in the first-half of the campaign. He has scored seven goals this season and chipped in with a number of assists for the Zvishavane outfit and is one of the reasons they have rebounded into the title race. – @innocentskizoe
