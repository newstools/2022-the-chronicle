The sacrifices fathers make often go unnoticed and unappreciated.
Their value is sometimes not acknowledged.
Hence they have been called the world’s most unsung heroes.
They’re called dogs sometimes.  They have the immense responsibility of demonstrating the heart of God to their children, to leave behind a spiritual legacy.
A happy fatter is a happy family.
A happy family has a happy father. Happy Father’s Day to all fathers. – Obert Dube The African Poet
