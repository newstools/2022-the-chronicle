He said it has been in the works for the past three years. Sizalobuhle, the rapper said, is an honour to his late mother whom he loved dearly and misses. “Sizalobuhle is a double CD album with 18 tracks in total. Sizalobuhle, the title track of the album is a song dedicated to my mother uMaMnkandla who passed away. The whole album is dedicated to her,” said Msiz’kay, adding that the album’s track list will be released close to the date of the album release.  “We’re also still sorting out budgets and logistics regarding video shoots for the songs. We’re hoping to shoot videos for at least half of the songs on the album.” He said the launch will afford his fans a chance to meet him in person and also witness him performing live. The artiste thanked industry players who have been supporting him to make the album launch a success. “I’m glad that the event has attracted a number of people who’re willing to work with my brand, which is quite a great thing for us as local artistes,” said Msiz’kay. The event is promising to be exciting as the NGZ is a venue that the artiste has familiarised with as he, in December last year, successfully hosted the “I Love Msiz’kay Concert” there. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615319 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In the past three years, Msiz’kay has been on a meteoric rise as his songs have been becoming bangers. These include Ngisemathandweni, Ngawuzw’umoya Wam and iCherry Yam. – @mthabisi_mthire
