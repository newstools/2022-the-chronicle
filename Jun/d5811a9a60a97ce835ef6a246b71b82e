Nutty O who was the opening act, sent the packed auditorium into a delirium, dropping hit after hit from his debut album Mustard Seed. Indeed, Nutty O is poised for greater heights, not because of his musical prowess, but also because of his investment in the music business.  Firstly, his sound and musicality were on-point. Thanks to his investment in the group, now backed by the most-sought after Shabach The Band, comprising talented instrumentalists, Nutty O had the perfect sound. The live feel made his act all the more outstanding than the other two musicians on the night. Not only was the sound perfect, but also Nutty O’s set was complete with dancers whose presence made him the best act of the night. While Winky D cuts a lone figure on the stage and at times makes people sing along, Nutty O was flanked by talented dancers whose pulsating paces thrilled many. <img class="wp-image-587907 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/WINKY-D1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/WINKY-D1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/WINKY-D1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Winky D Born Carrington Chiadzwa, Nutty O could be the next big artiste out of Zimbabwe for as long as he remains level-headed. Put together by Gateway Stream, the show proved that Zimbabwean artistes can hold their own and this is the direction promoters should take.
