Never has the sermon of appreciating local content been more relevant than at the present moment where international acts have shown a level of disrespect. Obama also said the event will herald a new era in the dance sector. <img class="wp-image-614067 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Asante-Mo-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Asante-Mo-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Asante-Mo-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asante Mo “This Festival will be a first of many and will introduce more shows where we will be having inter-city and international festivals if all goes according to plan. There is a bigger picture beyond what will happen on Saturday. I therefore urge revellers to come in their numbers and experience history in the making, ” added Obama. – @eMKlass_49
