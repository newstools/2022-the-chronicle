The Chronicle German international defender Antonio Rudiger has joined Spanish and European champions Real Madrid from Chelsea, the two clubs confirmed yesterday. The 29-year-old centre-back, who was out of contract at Chelsea, has signed a four-year deal in the Spanish capital, Real announced. In a statement on their official website, Madrid said Rudiger would be unveiled at a press conference at the club’s training ground on June 20. <img class="size-full wp-image-614179" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Antonio-Rudiger.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Antonio-Rudiger.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Antonio-Rudiger-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Antonio Rudiger.

Rudiger, who started his professional career at VfB Stuttgart, spent two seasons at Roma before joining Chelsea in 2017 for a reported £29 million ($36.4m).  In his time at Stamford Bridge, Rudiger notably won the FA Cup in 2018 and the Europa League in 2019, although he didn’t play in the latter final. He then helped Thomas Tuchel’s side to win the Champions League last year. “We bid farewell to Antonio Rudiger as he departs Stamford Bridge with his Chelsea contract expiring, bringing to a close his five trophy-filled years with the club,” the London side said in a statement. <img class="size-full wp-image-605307" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thomas Tuchel Rudiger joins a Real side who are fresh from winning the Champions League by beating Liverpool 1-0 in last weekend’s final in Paris.
