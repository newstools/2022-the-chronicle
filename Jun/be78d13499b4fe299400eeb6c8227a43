THE Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Primary and Secondary Education chairperson, Cde Torerai Moyo says the Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (Zimsec) November examination fees are beyond the reach of ordinary Zimbabweans. The Gokwe-Chireya legislator said the recently announced fees structure for Grade Seven, Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are too high, as such his committee will this week summon the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Dr Evelyn Ndlovu, her permanent secretary Mrs Tumisang Thabela and Zimsec to appear before the committee to justify the fees. <img class="wp-image-613983 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimsec Early this month, the examination body said Grade Seven examinations fees will be US$30 for all the subjects, Ordinary Level fees were pegged at US$11 per subject for candidates in public, local authorities-run and  non-profit-making schools with the Government paying a subsidy of US$24 while those in private schools and colleges shall fork out US$24 per subject. Advanced Level candidates in public and local authority-run schools will pay US$22 per subject with the Government contributing US$26 in subsidy. Private schools and college candidates shall pay US$48 per subject. All payments, however, shall be in local currency at the prevailing interbank rate upon the opening window for examination fees payment on July 22. <img class="wp-image-575816 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Tumisang Thabela “This is a matter of urgency, a very important matter which must be given the urgency it deserves. “I personally feel the figures are too high and a majority of our people will never afford them which will result in our learners’ right to basic education being violated because they won’t be able to sit for these examinations. In my constituency, I have been inundated with calls from people asking me if it’s true that they will pay US$30 for Grade Seven examinations,” said the Member of Parliament. <img class="wp-image-617809 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/delegates-follow-President-address-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/delegates-follow-President-address-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/delegates-follow-President-address-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Cde Moyo heaped praise on President Mnangagwa after Zimbabwe’s first citizen announced in March that basic education in public schools will be free beginning next year which means even examination costs will be carried by the Government. “That was a huge statement by His Excellency. What that means is that our people with children in primary school will have disposable income now as they will not have school fees and  indeed examination fees worries unlike now, which is why I am firmly convinced that those fees must fall for the benefit of our people,” said the MP. In 2021, 325 573 candidates wrote their Grade Seven examinations, compared to 327 559 in 2020 while for Ordinary level 249 914 sat for  their exams with 264 099 having sat the previous year. There were 49 128 candidates who wrote their Advanced level exams, slightly less than the 50 287 figure the previous year.
