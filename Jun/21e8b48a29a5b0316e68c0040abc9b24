ZIFA says the decision by the Zifa Bulawayo Province council to fire chairman Francis Ntutha and board member John Mutero for alleged misappropriation of funds was unconstitutional. The two were booted out for alleged misappropriation of funds at the beginning of May after they failed to present financial statements at the annual general meeting. This was the second time Ntutha had been relieved of his duties after 2019 when he was accused of paying himself US$1 020 without authorisation from his board. <img class="alignnone wp-image-415165 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Zifa-house-680x380-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Zifa-house-680x380-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Zifa-house-680x380-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> However, the Zifa national executive committee ordered Bulawayo Province to reinstate Ntutha in 2020, saying the matter would be dealt with by way of summons. Zifa has again ordered that Ntutha be reinstated together with Mutero.  “We advise that the decision to recall the mentioned individuals from the executive committee of the province was done unconstitutionally. For the recalling of a member of an executive committee to be done, the issue should be clearly stated on the agenda of the congress meeting. “If the province intends to proceed with revocation, we advise that an EGM should be convened clearly stating the issue of recall and the basis of the recall to the members, especially those affected on its convocation sent to members inviting them to the meeting. As of now we advise that we are not accepting the decision or the resolution made as stated in your letter on the basis that it was done in contravention of the constitution,” reads the Zifa correspondence. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 cells Takawira Madza, who had been elevated to Bulawayo Province acting chairman, said findings by a finance committee appointed by Ntutha unearthed a number of irregularities in the province’s finances, including withdrawals without backing of payment vouchers. The finance committee chaired by Lloyd Munhanga also discovered that there were no records of income through EcoCash and in some cases there were double payments of salaries. The board had also backdated its allowances to 2018 and in some cases some workers were paid board allowances. Also critical was that there were payments highlighted Covid-19, but their destination could not be ascertained. Madza said at that time they had given Ntutha four months to engage auditors, but he did not do so. – @innocentskizoe
