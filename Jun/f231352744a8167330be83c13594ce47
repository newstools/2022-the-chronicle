POLICE in Matabeleland North have launched a manhunt for a domestic worker who allegedly fatally struck his employer with a log after he questioned him about a stray cow. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Glory Banda said police were keen to find Clayton Jengezi (37) who was employed as a herdsman by the now deceased Jealous Sibanda (71) at Riverbank Village, under Chief Deli in Nyamandlovu. No further details about Jengezi are known. He disappeared after allegedly killing Sibanda on Saturday and his whereabouts are not known.  Sibanda confirmed dead at Tsholotsho District Hospital where he had been rushed. “Police in Nyamandlovu are appealing for information which may lead to the arrest of Clayton Jengezi who is being sought for a murder case which occurred on the 4th day of June 2022 at Riverbank Village, Chief Deli, Nyamandlovu,” said Insp Banda. He said Jengezi allegedly struck Sibanda with a log once on the head after a misunderstanding. Sibanda had questioned him about a stray cow that he had penned together with his herd. In a fit of rage, Jengezi allegedly picked a log and struck his employer once and he fell down and lost consciousness. Sibanda was rushed to Tsholotsho District Hospital but died upon admission, Insp Banda said. He said in a separate incident, police in Tsholotsho arrested Francis Ndlovu (51) for attempted murder after he allegedly struck Meluleki Dube (32) with an axe once on the forehead and once on the left side of the head for refusing to share beer. <img class="alignnone wp-image-490379 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/axe-F.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/axe-F.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/axe-F-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It is alleged that on Saturday while at Tshitatshawa Bottle Store in Tsholotsho, Ndlovu axed Dube. Police said after attacking the victim, Ndlovu dragged him into a nearby toilet where he left him unconscious. One of the patrons who visited the toilet to relieve himself found Dube still unconscious and alerted others. Dube was rushed to Tsholotsho District Hospital where he is recovering while Ndlovu was arrested for attempted murder. He is expected to appear in court soon. Insp Banda urged members of the public to respect the value of life and solve their disputes amicably without resorting to violence. “We encourage citizens to value the sanctity of life by not taking revenge and shedding blood whenever they have some misunderstandings. Community leaders and clerics can assist rivals to come to terms through counselling and should that fail, the wheels of justice should be allowed to turn,” he said. — @ncubeleon
