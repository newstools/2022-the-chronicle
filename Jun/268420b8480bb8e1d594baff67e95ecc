FOUR senior managers at Sable Chemical Industries have been placed on paid leave pending investigations into a myriad of accusations levelled against them. These are human resources manager, Mr Zvishamiso Musvipa, finance manager Mr Victor Makoni, security officer Mr Gideon Govheya and health services officer Mr Aston Masamha.  They face various charges ranging from abuse of office, theft, insubordination, incompetence, sexual harassment of junior workers, among others. Reports indicate that Mr Makoni collapsed and died at his Newtown home on 13 June and was buried last Thursday at Kwekwe Central Cemetery. It is not clear whether his death is linked to the development at the company or not. A post-mortem, however, showed that Mr Makoni suffered a stroke. The company’s chief operations officer,  Mr Morgan Chinoda, confirmed the development. <img class="alignnone wp-image-618967 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I want to put the record straight that they were not suspended but they are on paid leave. That is all I can say for now,” said Mr Chinoda who could not be drawn to disclose more details on the charges. A letter signed by chief executive officer, Mr Bothwell Nyajeka, also seen by Chronicle Business also did not state the allegations levelled against the quartet. The letter dated April 28, 2022, placed the four on paid leave for one month before a further three weeks was added with effect from May 26, 2022. “Sable Chemical Industries Limited (the Company) has received concerning information and allegations warranting the immediate undertaking of a comprehensive audit to investigate the veracity of such information and allegations,” reads part of the letter. <img class="wp-image-618970 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-9-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-9-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-9-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Investigate “To facilitate the audit, the company is enjoined to place certain personnel, yourself included, on paid leave with immediate effect to allow sufficient time for the required audit. Such paid leave will be with full benefits and will not be deducted from your accrued leave days. <img class="wp-image-618973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Abuse of office “For the avoidance of doubt, this letter should not be construed to imply that the company is placing you on suspension or levying any charges against you as your placement on paid leave is merely to carry out the requisite checks on the aforementioned information and allegations.” Sources within the company, however, said the development emanated from complaints raised through the company’s suggestion box where some allegations were raised including theft and sexual harassment, among others. “We are afraid that if the infighting continues, it might derail the refurbishment project that is currently underway,” fumed one of the workers on condition of anonymity.
