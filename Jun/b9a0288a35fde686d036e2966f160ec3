The Chronicle It’s not time to sleep but to arise. Ephesians 5 vs 13 <img class="wp-image-570964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible . . . wake up sleeper, rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you. Ephesians 5:13 Rip the cover off those frauds and see how attractive they look in the light of Christ. (MSG) Arise and shine and forget your background. You might have committed adultery, fornication or you might have had jealousy and accepted the “water pot” culture and traditions. But Jesus is a merciful and graceful God, no matter what your gender is, God will forgive you as long as you kneel before him and ask for His forgiveness and repent. The Samaritan woman was known as a woman who had five husbands and who was living with another man (to whom she was not married), but Jesus blessed her, forgave her of all her sins and washed her iniquities. To prove that Jesus never held grudges or held her guilty nor condemned her, the very day she was converted, she became a power-packed evangelist. <img class="alignnone wp-image-616701 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-15-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-15-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-15-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She brought the whole village to Jesus Christ including men, women and children. If someone has an encounter with Jesus Christ, his or her life will never ever be the same again. Christ will transform your life. He will turn your past scars into future stars. It is very possible to turn your bitterness into “betterness.” Call the past the past! Pray and fast, seek counselling and tap into your calling. Women of GOD, let the light that is in you expel the darkness that is around you. In the Bible both men and women followed Christ. Women were not left behind. There are women of God spreading the gospel internationally like Juanita Bynum and the Joyce Meyers of our time. There is a verse in the Bible that states.  “The Lord gave the Word, and great was the mass of women organised for warfare that published it” Psalms 68:11. Preaching of the gospel is not for men only. In the kingdom of God there is neither female nor male. We are all one in Christ. Galatians 4 vs 28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. NIV
