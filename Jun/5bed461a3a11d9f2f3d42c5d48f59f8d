The Afcon-winning coach believes Caf and the five concerned countries can have their engagements postponed to a later date. While African World Cup representatives will be engaged in the qualifiers, other nations which will be in Qatar are expected to engage in friendlies.  “This would give the opportunity to the countries qualified (for the World Cup) to do their preparations,” the former PSG midfielder added. “I think we can find a solution to postpone the qualifiers scheduled for September.” <img class="wp-image-548545 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/CAF-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/CAF-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/CAF-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Caf In September, only Morocco have free time to engage in friendlies after Zimbabwe in Group K, whom they were scheduled to face, will not be in action as they are suspended by Fifa and Caf.
