More than 1 000 school heads from across the country are expected to attend the non-elective conference which is the first since the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. The outbreak of the pandemic forced Government to enforce lockdowns which banned public gtherings as part of measures to curb the spread of the virus. The pandenmic has claimed more than 5 500 lives in the country and more than 6 million globally. Gwanda High School headmaster Mr Arthur Maphosa is the Nash president, having taken over from Mr Johnson Madhuku, who is now a legislator.  Mr Maphosa said the conference provides school heads with an opportunity to interact and learn from each other. They will also interface with the Zimbabwe School Examination Council (Zimsec) on how best to run examinations and avoid leakages that haunt the exercise almost every year. In 2020 a senior manager at the examination board was suspended after a part-time employee Arnold Maimba leaked Ordinary Mathematics as well as English Paper One and Two. Another issue that will most likely come under interrogation is the issue of examination fees collections methods which schools have been complaining about saying they incur costs as some of them are charged as much as $200 000 in bank charges. This year’s conference runs under the theme; ‘Education through and beyond Covid-19’. Mr Maphosa said: “There are a lot of professional issues to be discussed for the benefit of our schools and the ministry at large. <img class="wp-image-613983 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimsec We will also engage with the Zimbabwe Examination Council (Zimsec) on how best to run our examinations and avoid any leakages that have haunted us in the past.” He said Vice President Chiwenga who is also the Minister of Health and Child Care will share with us schoolheads strategies to run schools in Covid-19 era.
