FARMERS in Matabeleland South Province have formed more than 150 field schools which have helped to equip them with practical skills to increase production. A farmer field school is a group-based learning process whereby farmers carry out experimental learning activities that help them understand the ecology of their farming practice. These activities involve simple experiments, regular field observations and group analysis. The knowledge gained from these activities enables participants to make their own locally specific decisions about farming management practices.  This approach represents a radical departure from earlier agricultural extension programmes, in which farmers were expected to adopt generalised recommendations that have been formulated by specialists from outside the community. Each farmer field school has between 10 to 30 members. Matabeleland South acting provincial agricultural rural development services director, Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu said farmer field schools have gained momentum in the province as farmers in all wards have adopted them. “Farming is a practice and the purpose of farmer field schools is to ensure that farmers have a practical platform where they can learn, experiment, identify problems and come up with solutions in order to maximise production. The field or work station of the farmer becomes the school. The concept has grown as we have more than 150 farmer field schools in the province, some at ward level and others at village level,” he said. <img class="wp-image-620839 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock Farmers with a similar enterprise such as livestock pen fattening or tomato production come together and form a group with about 10 to 30 members. They will be sharing their knowledge, experience and skills in that particular enterprise which can help them maximise production. “The farmers have one station which will be their learning point and then they go on to implement solutions in their respective stations. For example, farmers can have a common kraal as their work station and then they go on to implement the strategies they would have come up with at their individual kraals,” said Mr Ndlovu. He said the concept is a good way of motivating farmers to learn from their counterparts. –@DubeMatutu
