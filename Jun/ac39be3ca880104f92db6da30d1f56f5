Government assisted 560 000 learners through the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM), and reiterates its standing policy that no learner should be turned away for non-payment of school fees,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. She said the Government also continues to support the vulnerable through provision of food aid and food subsidies while also providing others with cash transfers as well as medical treatment orders. Minister Mutsvangwa said the removal of restrictions on food importation on products such as maize and wheat, cooking oil, among other basic commodities, is part of Government efforts to cushion citizens from drought. “Under social protection, 61 percent of rural households received some form of support, with Government accounting for 67 percent of the support rendered,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.  She said the report also noted that there has been an improvement in household food security situation, improved dietary following various measures employed by Government. “The proportion of households in the acceptable category also increased from 29 percent in 2021 to 35 percent in 2022. Government has instituted programmes to address the country’s dietary situation, notably the Agriculture and Food Systems Strategy, which has, as one of its components, the establishment of a village and agribusiness hub garden,” she said. Minister Mutsvangwa said the Government is also rehabilitating several irrigation schemes across the country to improve national food security. A total of 394 irrigation schemes have been established in the various districts with 51 percent of them fully functional, 28 percent partly operational and 21 percent yet to operate. “These include the National Accelerated Rehabilitation and Development Programme targeting the rehabilitation and development of at least 200 hectares in every district annually over a ten-year period,” she said. “To date, 216 000 hectares including plantations are under irrigation of which 116 000 hectares are for cropping. The Government intends to increase the hectarage for cropping from 116 000 hectares to 350 000 hectares,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.
