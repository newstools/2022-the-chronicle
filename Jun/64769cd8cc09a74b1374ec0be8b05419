The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter AFRICAN countries, Zimbabwe included, should free themselves from colonial bondage of former colonial masters’ languages and embrace indigenous languages that promote national identity. Speaking at the National Languages Indaba in Victoria Falls, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga said the country, Africa and the rest of the colonised world downplayed their own indigenous languages preferring foreign ones that were imposed as a way to entrenching colonialism. VP Chiwenga said, as proud Zimbabweans, people should enjoy the use of their indigenous languages and express ourselves indigenously. <img class="size-full wp-image-604144" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vice President Costantino Chiwenga “I am sure you will agree with me that our country, continental Africa and the rest of the then colonised world had now downplayed our own indigenous languages in preference of western languages. “The oppressors sought to trivialise our identity, unity, and cohesion as a way to entrench colonialism hence the continued fantasising and use of English and other of the colonial past in most of our communication at the expense of our indigenous languages needs to be reviewed,” said VP Chiwenga. He said Zimbabwe was making great strides towards recognising local languages as a medium for asserting and preserving cultural values. The country identified 16 official languages which are enshrined in the constitution while efforts are being made to identify those that were left out. Government has also set up the National Languages Institute housed at Midlands State University where national documents are translated into indigenous languages as a way of promoting use of local languages in national development. The languages indaba which started on Monday, seeks to create a platform towards drafting of a national languages policy and for dialogue among various stakeholders to appreciate the role of indigenous languages as a key ingredient for sustainable development of our country. <img class="size-full wp-image-421359" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/MSU.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/MSU.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/MSU-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Midlands State University VP Chiwenga said the Zimbabwe had made great strides in correcting the wrongs made by white supremacists with regard to use of foreign language and among the remedies is ensuring indigenous languages are taught in school. He said former colonisers “imposed their languages on Africa and robbed us of the right to use our own mother languages as they sought to entrench colonialism.” “Yes, as a nation we continue to use English in most of our business communication. This trend continues elsewhere in Africa and beyond. It is important to note that this National Languages Conference is indeed a timely reminder that we need to change that status quo,” said VP Chiwenga. He challenged Africans to take pride in their mother tongues and sing from the heart and soul using the persevering indigenous languages.  He praised President Mnangagwa for being an icon of promoting people’s rights including their legitimate right to use their indigenous languages. “Indigenous languages are key in promoting and preserving our pristine and enduring cultural values. They provide us with the necessary national identity that binds us in our diversity and bring about economic development by ensuring that communication is in our indigenous languages,” added VP Chiwenga. In a speech read on his behalf by his Deputy Raymore Machingura, Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira said as the country implements strategies towards attaining Vision 2030, efforts should be focused on how national languages should be used effectively alongside dominant languages in achieving techno scientific development. <img class="size-full wp-image-617920" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/QWE.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/QWE.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/QWE-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Deputy Raymore Machingura “We thank you Your Excellency through the Second Republic for transforming our education through Education 5.0 with a heritage bias. The confidence of a people is seen in how they can technologically and industrially advance based on knowledge coming from their own language,” he said. — @ncubeleon
