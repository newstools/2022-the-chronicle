IN a bizarre incident, a 21-year-old Zhombe man allegedly raped a mentally challenged 70-year-old granny before killing her. Midlands Provincial Police spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said he was yet to get the report. But Zhombe Chief Ndabezinhle Weight Gwesela confirmed the incident saying it happened on June 15. <img class="size-full wp-image-546236" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Emmanuel-Mahoko.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Emmanuel-Mahoko.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Emmanuel-Mahoko-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko “It is true the incident happened in my area. King Hlatswayo (the accused) is from headman Mabhani. The woman is said to have been coming from the shops when he pounced on her,” said Chief Gwesela. It is however, not yet clear what exactly transpired but it is alleged that Hlatshwayo strangled the woman during the rape ordeal. Chief Gwesela said the culprit has since been arrested.  “He was picked up by police and is in custody as we speak,” he said. He said the grizzly incident was a taboo in his community and he was considering banishing Hlatshwayo. “He is an animal who should not be kept among people. He has become a danger to society. We will sit down and see how best we can handle the situation,” he said.
