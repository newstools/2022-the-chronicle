THE return of the high-profile international Econet Victoria Falls Marathon after a two-year break has been sweetened with the addition of what is promising to be a memorable pre-marathon musical show pitting Ammara Brown, Winky D and Jah Prayzah. <img class="wp-image-600180 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-50.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-50.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-50-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jah Prayzah After being affected by the Covid-19 induced lockdowns, the scenic marathon was held as a virtual event last year after Covid-19 restrictions were eased. This year, the long-distance foot race returns to the resort city on July 3, exactly a fortnight from today. To add to the fun, organisers have invited the three artistes for a show they have dubbed the “Big 3 music show” that will take place on July 1. Entry to the music show will be free for registered marathon runners. Jah Prayzah and Winky D are fresh from a very successful show in Harare this past weekend with their addition to the marathon exciting many. While Jah Prayzah played in Victoria Falls this year at the Mapopoma Festival, Ammara was last in the resort city before the global pandemic. <img class="wp-image-442589 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-5-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-5-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-5-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ammara Brown Organisers expect about 2 000 music lovers for the music show. Meanwhile, registration for the marathon that attracts runners from over 20 countries is still underway with organisers, Wild Frontiers, offering 160 free slots for athletes based in Bulawayo and Matabeleland North provinces.
