TRAVELLING to Hwange National Park has been made easy after local airline, Kuva Air launched maiden scheduled flights connecting the country’s major tourist resorts. The Embraer EMB 120 landed at the Hwange National Park Airport last Wednesday to mark the start of scheduled flights linking the country’s biggest game park to Victoria Falls, Kariba and Harare. The more than 14 000 square kilometre Hwange National Park is home to the “Big Five” and hundreds of other mammal and bird species but has not been easily accessible because of lack of air travel. <img class="wp-image-614740 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kuva Air Clients used road transport from Victoria Falls or Bulawayo while some used private airlines directly into the park where private conservancies operate aerodromes.
Kuva Air will fly three times per week. Kuva airline spokesperson, Mr Darryl Dzapasi, said their goal was to increase access into tourism resorts, adding that the route will be permanent. “We want people to have a way to reach Hwange as we give them exposure at affordable rates. Today was a first visit and we are going to bring travellers regularly and promise to do our best and keep our route,” said Mr Dzapasi. He said Kuva Air was working with various stakeholders and tourism operators around Hwange for partnerships and thanked the Airports Company of Zimbabwe, the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe and Government for creating aviation space for new airlines. Hwange National Park Airport is located close to African Sun’s 100-room lodge with several lodges on the edge and inside the game park. <img class="size-medium wp-image-612507" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Executive-Air-marketing-executive-Darrly-Dzapasi-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Executive-Air-marketing-executive-Darrly-Dzapasi-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Executive-Air-marketing-executive-Darrly-Dzapasi.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />  Darryl Dzapasi Hwange Safari Lodge general manager, Mr James Kuwanda, said the new route will increase arrivals. “This is an exciting development for hotels around this area and will improve arrivals to the destination,” he said.  “We will work together to promote this destination and attract more tourists,” said Mr Kuwanda. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority regional manager for Matabeleland, Ms Tsikadzashe Mberi, said there was vast untapped potential in Hwange, which can be harnessed by airlines and other operators. “We want to thank Kuva Air for choosing this route. They are flying here because they have seen value in this destination,” she said. “I’m sure we are going to work together with the new airline and hope they are going to enter into partnerships with operators.” <img class="wp-image-614742 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Tsikadzashe Mberi ACZ marketing manager, Ms Sarudzai Muza, said Kuva Air was a game changer in terms of promoting domestic airports in the country. “Recently they launched the Kariba route and are giving the first scheduled flights linking major resorts. We are so excited about this and encourage Kuva Air to also fly into Masvingo and Buffalo Range to promote domestic tourism and the ZimBho campaign,” said Ms Muza. She said this will promote trade and tourism by linking the country’s towns and resorts. The development comes as Government is on a drive to upgrade aerodromes and small airports that have not been fully utilised over the years and improve connectivity in the country. <img class="wp-image-614748 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange National Park Airport Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona recently visited Hwange National Park Airport and said plans were underway to upgrade the runway and terminal so as to attract more airlines. — @ncubeleon
