We have five DCCs in Bulawayo and today I met two of them and tomorrow (today), I will convene another meeting with two others,” he said. “I wanted to hear their challenges and how we can chip in as national leadership so that we build our party. I also wanted to do fire-fighting because once you have internal party processes such as primaries you are bound to have infighting and hatred. We are one people who belong to one party, Zanu-PF.” <img class="size-full wp-image-622561" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/jabulani-sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/jabulani-sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/jabulani-sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Jabulani Sibanda Cde Mohadi said as the party leadership, their task is to give direction and advice in the event of disagreements. “We need to build the party in Bulawayo and as Vice-President I don’t have the answers, but all I was doing was to just listen and give them the necessary advice,” he said.
