Put in to bat after Afghanistan won the toss, Zimbabwe were all out for 228 with Innocent Kaia (63) and Ryan Burl (51) contributing half centuries.  Making only his second ODI appearance, Kaia hit six fours and one six off 74 balls before being caught by wicketkeeper Rahmanullah Gurbaz off the bowling of Fareed Ahmad, whose 3-56 were the best Afghan figures. Burl was unbeaten after facing 61 deliveries and his total included two fours and one six in the Zimbabwean capital.  <img class="alignnone wp-image-615126 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-36.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-36.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-36-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> After opener Gurbaz was out having scored only four runs, Zadran and Shah took control while Zimbabwe used eight bowlers.

The two victories in Zimbabwe have lifted them to 90 points, five less than second-placed England, who have played four more matches.
