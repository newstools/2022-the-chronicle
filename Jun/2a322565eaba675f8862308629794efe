The Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was set up to ensure the full participation of African peoples in the economic development and integration of the continent. It is intended as a platform for people from all African states to be involved in discussions and decision-making on the problems and challenges facing the continent. Rather than being elected directly by the people, PAP members are designated by the legislatures of their Member States and members of their domestic legislatures. The ultimate aim is for the Parliament to be an institution with full legislative powers, whose members are elected by universal suffrage.  Until such time, the PAP has consultative, advisory and budgetary oversight powers within the African Union. Ahead of the election, Chief Charumbira said once in office, he would adopt a five-point plan namely; to strengthen the institutional capacity of PAP as a support body of the African Union ensuring accountability, transparency and prudent use of finances and resources, ensure that PAP has adequate financial resources with an enhanced funding architecture in order to meet all budget programme for all committees and plenary sessions to conduct business fully according to the set strategic and action plans, among others. <img class="size-full wp-image-622588" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Charumbira.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Charumbira.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Charumbira-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Fortune Charumbira Chief Charumbira also promised to initiate robust Parliament programmes and policies on youth empowerment, gender equality and inclusivity in order to also enhance poverty eradication in line with AU Agenda 2063 and sustainable development goals.
