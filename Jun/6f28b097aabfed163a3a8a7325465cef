THE cold spell being experienced in most parts of the country will persist until Saturday while light rains are also expected tomorrow, the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has said. It attributed this to a weather phenomenon known as ‘Cut-Off Low’, which has induced some rainfall in most parts of the country. From Sunday, Bulawayo and other parts of the country have been experiencing some light rains, which were coupled with low temperatures.  In a statement yesterday, the MSD said over the duration of the cold spell, maximum temperatures will not exceed 19 degrees Celsius up to Saturday. “A low-pressure system in the rain inducing levels of the atmosphere mereologically referred to as a Cut-Off Low is developing over Zimbabwe. “It is expected to draw in and circulate moisture within its proximity. This should be coupled with relatively cold south-easterly winds from the south-east cost of Southern Africa,” reads the statement. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-621826" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Generally light rain is expected across the country from Wednesday evening 29 June 2022. It should be cold, windy and cloudy till Saturday 2 July 2022 with most maximum daytime in the teens.” The Met Department also warned of the possibility of frozen rain in some parts of the country but said this should not be mistaken for snow. It said temperatures should become warmer starting on Sunday. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-621829" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-45-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-45-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-45-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The weather forecaster urged farmers to harvest part of their crops that need to be harvested so that it is not affected by the light showers. The cold spell could cause respiratory illnesses and minors and the elderly are the most vulnerable, said the agency. Members of public are urged to wear warm clothing during the cold weather event and to desist from starting open fires. — @nqotshili
