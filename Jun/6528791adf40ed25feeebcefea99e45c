At the moment he is training three youths. He gets some of his interns from vocational training centres in Matabeleland South province while others approach him  directly. His love for dressmaking has led him to continue sewing even at his age when his peers can hardly thread a machine because of poor eyesight. Mr Moyo who has 36 years experience as a tailor said he gained his skills through watching other tailors. Later on in his career, he realised that he had to impart his knowledge to youngsters so that they could have a source of livelihood. He started off with one hand-sewing machine. Mr Moyo now has eight industrial sewing machines which he uses to run his business and train his students. He said charges his interns a minimal fee for his services. Mr Moyo trains his students for a period of three to six months. During their training, students take their own orders and prepare garments for clients, which helps them to get income. “I started working as a tailor in 1986 after I realised that I could realise good income from it. I learnt how to sew by observing others do it. I started off in Bulawayo and I later moved to Gwanda in 2009. I have never been employed. There is no clothing item that I can’t sew. I’m able to master a design and pattern by just simply looking at it and from there I can replicate it and produce the exact item,” he said. “I later realised that I had to share this knowledge that I have acquired. I trained my first student in 2012 who was a neighbour’s daughter. I started off on a low note training students here and there. I was later approached by vocational training centres to assist in training their students. I train students from Guyu Vocational Training Centre, Pangani Vocational Training Centre and Young Africa. <img class="wp-image-616495 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> from Guyu Vocational Training Centre From 2018 I have trained more than 20 students.” Mr Moyo said some students he has trained have gone on to start their own businesses in different towns or in their rural areas. He said to him training youths is empowering them to start their own lives. Mr Moyo said the country is rich with talented and skilled people who could impart their knowledge to youths so that they can have a source of livelihood. He said it was unfortunate that youths in rural areas were flocking to neighbouring countries to obtain skills when they could get that locally. Mr Moyo said for new students he starts with the basics which include familiarisation with a sewing machine. He said he always prioritises the safety of his students. “If you are a tailor, a good one for that matter, a day can’t pass by without you getting clients. Even if people buy their clothes online or from boutiques and shops, some will seek the services of a tailor to have their clothes altered. Some clients prefer tailor-made clothes. These days people like wearing African attires and that is a business opportunity for tailors,” said Mr Moyo. He said he was able to pay fees for his five children using money from his tailoring business. <img class="wp-image-605607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> money Mr Moyo said he always advises his students to make use of potential business opportunities in their areas. He said those who have taken heed of his advice are now sewing school uniforms and selling them in their communities. Mr Moyo said dedication to his work has helped him to attract customers. “I sew every garment like it were my own. I don’t rush and neither am I slow. I work at a pace that allows me to deliver on time and to bring out a good product. I always try to deliver on time so that I don’t inconvenience my clients. At my age most people will be struggling with their eyesight, mine isn’t perfect as well but I can still work. I am now wearing spectacles due to old age,” he said. Ms Florence Maphosa (21) who just completed her six months training with Mr Moyo said she is now able to sew tracksuits, uniforms and different attires. She is now temporarily operating from Mr Moyo’s shop. Ms Maphosa said she recently got an order to sew 10 tracksuits from a local college, which she delivered last week. “Training with Mr Moyo has helped me a lot. I have gained a lot of knowledge. I can now make various clothing items. I delivered 10 tracksuits to a local college last week. I was able to do most of the work alone. Mr Moyo gets a certain percentage of the money I realise since I’m using his resources but I’m glad that I’m now making money and I’m getting orders,” she said.  Ms Perseverance Sitoboli (21) has been training with Mr Moyo for the past five months. She said she has learnt a lot through working with him. Ms Sitoboli said it was her desire to get her own sewing machines and start her own business. She said Mr Moyo was a good trainer as he was patient with his students but also firm. — @DubeMatutu
