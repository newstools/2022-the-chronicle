The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter THE richness of talent that is furnished by creatives from Zimbabwe, particularly the Matabeleland region is something one cannot argue about. From musicians, actors, fine artists, guitarists, vocalists, drummists, and poets to models, the flair says it all. Their knack is not only embraced in Zimbabwe but across the African continent and the world at large. Examples of such artistes are musician, photographer and filmmaker Nkosiphile Sibanda aka Nkosi Nda and fashion designer, filmmaker and model Annie Gonyora-Sibanda aka Annie G. <img class="size-full wp-image-614485" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Nkosi-Nda-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Nkosi-Nda-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Nkosi-Nda-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nkosi Nda and Annie G The two lovebirds who are parents of three daughters made their names in the country in the past years and now, they are doing their level best to raise the Zimbabwean flag on a regional scale. The duo, who are a Bulawayo pride, are co-partners of the production company, NAS Pixels Creative Agency which is a partnership with Smilo Yane, a Swazi filmmaker. Their story to greatness in the film sector has seen them working on their debut film project named Detrimental State, a crime drama that features the crème de la crème film, among them actor Sifiso Simamane who is affectionately known for his role as Captain Mthimkhulu on South Africa’s SABC 1 thrilling soapie, Uzalo. Saturday Leisure recently caught up with the couple who went down memory lane on their journey to stardom. They also shared their plans for the future. Nkosi Nda said his journey has evolved from being a guitarist with a powerful voice as he has ventured deep into other arts disciplines. <img class="size-full wp-image-614491" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Sifiso-Simamane.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Sifiso-Simamane.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Sifiso-Simamane-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sifiso Simamane “Captain Mthimkhulu” “I’m a Bulawayo-born now Swazi-based creative who prides himself as a musician, photographer, and filmmaker. I was previously part of the Bulawayo Afro-soul band, Harmonic Rhythms which graced a lot of stages and platforms in Bulawayo and Johannesburg. “Now, I’m a solo artiste specialising in Afro-folk/Afro-soul. In my solo walk, I have played on a couple of stages in Joburg and Eswatini where I’ve shared stages with acts like The Soil, Bholoja and Velemseni, just to mention a few. “On my music side, I’m working on a couple of collaborative works with some Swazi artistes and I’m excited about them,” said Nkosi Nda. Annie said her journey in the arts started at a tender age. <img class="size-full wp-image-614497" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/The-Soil.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/The-Soil.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/The-Soil-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Soil “I first showcased as a model at the age of 15 at Miss Rural Zimbabwe. Since then, I’ve taken part in many pageants and events including Miss Earth, Miss Zimbabwe Environment, Miss Africa Zimbabwe and Eswatini Fashion Week. “As a designer, I’ve dressed a lot of notable names in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Eswatini. These include Mbo Mahocs, Gilmore Tee, Harmonic Rhythms, Lungile Ndlovu, Welshman, Mdura, Khole, Mandisa, King Terry, Makho Ndlovu, and Outfit Band. I continue to grow my brand as I’m working on some exciting projects,” she said. When she is not working on designs, Annie said she “will be actively involved in community projects, workshops and outreaches to aid vulnerable children and help upskill women in the community.” Turning to their stint as film industry players, the duo said they are working on their first project which they hope will infiltrate the regional industry because of its creativity.  “The film (Detrimental State) is a crime drama. It’s a story about two siblings who were born in a crime family that is based in Lesotho. They relocate to Eswatini to start a new life, but trouble follows them. “The thrill starts as they are caught in a crossfire in which the younger sibling dies. This is a story of love, revenge and new beginnings,” said Nkosi Nda. He said the star-studded cast includes himself, Annie G, Simamane, Yane, Uzuri Sibanda, Sihle Mpumalanga Zwane, Mayibongwe Mphikeli Mamba, and Msizi Hlophe. <img class="size-full wp-image-614499" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Nda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Nda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Nda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nkosi Nda “The movie will première in Eswatini in July although we are still to confirm the final dates. We want to spread this launch across the Southern African region as our goal is to promote the production, not only here in Eswatini, but in Zimbabwe, South Africa and many more countries. “The film was shot in Eswatini and also in Lesotho and all this was done under volatile conditions as the project was non-commissioned and had to be funded by the three partners,” said Nkosi Nda. He said they are also planning on working on many different projects in the future where they would like to work with different production companies and talent across Eswatini, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho and Botswana. “Some conversations have already started with talents in the mentioned countries. The future is exciting,” he said, adding that as an agency, they also focus on brand management, music, fashion, and content creation. – @mthabisi_mthire
