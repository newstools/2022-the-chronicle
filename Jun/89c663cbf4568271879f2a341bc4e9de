The Chronicle TIGER Woods said yesterday he has decided to withdraw from next week’s US Open outside Boston, citing a need for more time to get his body ready for major championship golf but still plans to play the Open Championship at St. Andrews in July. Woods returned to competition at the Masters in April, 14 months after nearly losing his right leg in a car crash, then played in last month’s PGA Championship where he withdrew in pain after posting a nine-over-par 79 in the third round. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615379 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Despite opting to sit out the US Open, an event he has won three times, Woods said he still plans to play in the JP McManus Pro-Am, a two-day event in Ireland, before hopefully competing in the July 14-17 Open the following week. “I previously informed the USGA that I will not be competing in the @usopengolf as my body needs more time to get stronger for major championship golf,” Woods, 46, wrote on Twitter.  “I do hope and plan to be ready to play in Ireland at @JPProAm and at @TheOpen next month. I’m excited to get back out there soon!” — SuperSport
