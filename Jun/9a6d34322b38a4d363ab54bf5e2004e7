The Chronicle FIFA is expected to confirm next week that it is on track to introduce “robot linesmen” at the 2022 World Cup. <img class="alignnone wp-image-546759 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> World Cup chiefs are keen to introduce the “semi-automated offside” system for their global showpiece which starts in November. Trials of the system took place in the Club World Cup won by Chelsea and the Arab Cup held in four of Doha’s eight World Cup stadia. The system uses 10 cameras to track 29 body points of each player. And with all the signs that the technology does work, bringing far quicker offside calls than under the current VAR line-led system, world chiefs are due to give a positive update at Monday’s delayed annual general meeting of the Law-making International FA Board.  The meeting is being held in Qatar, after the initial March date in Zurich was postponed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fifa is understood to be ready to state there are no impediments to the full introduction of the technology, which means that England’s opener against Iran on November 21 will be only the second game in which the technology is deployed. The opening match of the tournament, the first to use the technology, will see Senegal take on the Netherlands at Al Thumama Stadium. <img class="wp-image-615480 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-42-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-42-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-42-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Al Thumama Stadium England are then in action against Iran, before hosts Qatar kick off their campaign by taking on Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium. The Three Lions’ World Cup preparations were dealt a blow on Saturday as Gareth Southgate’s side fell 1-0 to Hungary. — The Sun
