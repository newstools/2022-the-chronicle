THE National Association of Secondary Heads (Nash) is ready to resume all sporting activities after managing to get more than 70 percent of learners vaccinated against Covid-19. In an interview from Victoria Falls ahead of Nash’s national congress set for next week, Nash president Arthur Maphosa applauded schools for heeding Government’s call to vaccinate their learners, adding that adhering to Covid-19 protocols has seen operations moving smoothly, which he believes will be an advantage to their call for full sport resumption. <img class="wp-image-617040 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vaccinated Last month Government lifted the temporary ban on schools’ sporting activities following a two-year absence as part of preventive measures to contain Covid-19.

Now we’re not talking about contact or non-contact sport, but we’re talking about resumption of all sporting activities. We are now ready for the resumption of all sports in general. We’re far above the 70 percent vaccination requirement and we’re waiting for the final signal to get games rolling,” said Maphosa. While Nash is yet to resume sporting activities, ball games are underway at primary schools with Matabeleland South province set to play host to the Naph national ball games finals at the end of next month. —  @ZililoR
