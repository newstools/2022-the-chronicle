A GWANDA family has lost a second family member after an axe wielding assailant invaded their home around midnight and killed a 68-year-old woman. The late, Emilia Ncube and her late maternal grandson Aron Zulu were in March attacked by an axe wielding man at their home in Spitzkop North Suburb. Zulu (21), who was struck four times with the axe, survived the incident but died on Tuesday evening while admitted to Gwanda Provincial Hospital. Ever since he was attacked, Zulu had been in and out of hospital. <img class="wp-image-614127 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gwanda Provincial Hospital. Ms Samukeliso Ncube who was also in the house managed to escape. The suspect appeared in court and was remanded at Gwanda Prison. On the fateful day, Zulu and his aunt Ms Ncube rushed into the house while being pursued by the suspect following a misunderstanding.  They locked the door but their assailant destroyed it using an axe to gain entry. He struck the old woman once on the head with an axe and also struck Zulu four times on the head. Ms Samukeliso Ncube who survived the attack said the death of her nephew had pained the family. “We were still trying to come to terms with the death of my mother and now we have lost my nephew. Ever since he was attacked, he hasn’t been well and his condition kept deteriorating. When he was discharged from hospital after the attack, we thought his life was out of danger but he was constantly in pain. As a family we appeal to anyone who can assist with contributions towards the funeral to send any amount to 0776 344 818,” she said. <img class="wp-image-614131 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Discharged from the hospital “We suspect that Aron died from the injuries he sustained but we are awaiting a post-mortem report to ascertain that.” Ward 5 Councillor, Gilbert Dube said it is always concerning when a life of a community member is lost because of crime. Clr Dube said cases of violence that are being recorded in his area are alarming and people no longer feel safe. He said some culprits were taking advantage of the absence of electricity in the area to prey on residents. Clr Dube said most cases were being perpetrated by machete wielding gangs believed to be illegal gold panners operating in the area. <img class="wp-image-614128 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> illegal gold panners “Just when the community was still coming to terms with the death of the old woman a young life has been lost because of crime. There is a high occurrence of crime in our area and it’s really alarming. Illegal gold panners that operate close by come to drink at business centres in the area from there, they terrorise members of the public,” he said. “Some of these illegal gold panners put up in incomplete houses within the ward which puts people at risk. We really need the presence of police so that this problem can be dealt with”–@DubeMatutu
