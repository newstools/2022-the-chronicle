GOVERNMENT has established five drug rehabilitation centres in different parts of the country while 600 drug abusers have been rehabilitated countrywide as Zimbabwe moves to address substance abuse among youths.  President Mnangagwa in February launched the National Anti-Drug and Substance Abuse campaign as the country seeks to come up with lasting solutions to drug abuse, which is on the increase. This has seen the Government setting up an inter-ministerial committee on substance abuse chaired by the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-437054" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/drugs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/drugs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/drugs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Following the establishment of the inter-ministerial committee, experts have expressed concerns over the use of non-conventional drugs by those taking drugs.
