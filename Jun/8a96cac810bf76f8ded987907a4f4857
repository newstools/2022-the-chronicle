BASKETBALL action returns to Khanyisile Sports Centre in Bulawayo on Saturday for the Southern Region Basketball League (SRBL). The SRBL is an off-season tournament, which will feature 10 teams from Matabeleland North, Midlands, Bulawayo and Masvingo. Brighton Musaidzi, the marketing and publicity officer for the competition, said the SRBL used to run a few years ago and this weekend’s event will mark its revival.  “We have revived the idea of improving basketball in the southern region of the country to catch up with the rest of the country. So far we have City Royals, Highlanders, Lakers, Mavericks, Legends, Unicorns, Falcons, Victoria falls Panthers Warriors and Masvingo Panthers. The Ladies’ teams are City Royals, Lakers and Highlanders,” said Musaidzi. Veteran basketball administrators Walter Mabhena and Sinda Mono will lead the revival of the league, which will be played at the end of every month. From Bulawayo, the competition will be held in Gweru, Masvingo and Victoria Falls.
