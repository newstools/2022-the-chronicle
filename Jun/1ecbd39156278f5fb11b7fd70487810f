The band’s spokesperson Abundance Mutori said Mokoomba is scheduled to travel to Europe next week for a tour that will end in August. He said the group that was formed in the old suburb of Chinotimba in Victoria Falls in 2008 has decided to bid farewell to its home folks and families in style with a live show tonight. The band was also set to perform at the National Languages Conference at Elephant Hills last night. “We’re staging a farewell concert at the River Brewery in Victoria Falls on Friday. Thereafter, the band will go on tour until mid-August, performing at many festivals and music venues, promoting the new music that will be on the band’s upcoming album,” said Mutori. <img class="wp-image-618352 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> River Brewery in Victoria Falls He said it was good to be performing in Victoria Falls for the public as they last staged a public show there before the outbreak of Covid-19. They played at Three Monkeys Restaurant and the River Brewery. During the successive lockdowns, the band has been performing consistently at corporate and private functions in Victoria Falls, including an international innovative concert that was held at the Lookout Café. Mutori said Mokoomba’s six band members; Mathias Muzaza who is the lead singer, Mutori (bass player), Trustworth Samende (lead guitarist), Phathisani Moyo (keyboard player), Ndaba Coster Moyo (drummer) and percussionist Miti Mugande, represent Victoria Falls’ “rainbow nationness”. He said their music is unique as the members hail from different ethnic groups such as Lubale, Nyanja, Tonga and Ndebele. As such, they sing in Lubale, Nyanja, Tonga, Ndebele, Shona and English and fuse traditional beats with funk, reggae, rock, and Afro-beat. They have released three albums to date: Kweseka (2009), Rising Tide (2012) and Luyando in 2017. Well-travelled Mokoomba’s road to success started with winning the Music Crossroads Inter-Regional Festival Competition in Malawi in 2008. <img class="wp-image-618355 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-58-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-58-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-58-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Denmark’s Roskilde Festival After releasing the Rising Tide, the band toured over 40 countries worldwide as the world fell for the captivating beat and an unstoppable enthusiasm on display from the group. They have performed at Denmark’s Roskilde Festival, the UK’s WOMAD festival, Belgium’s Couleur Cafe´ Festival, Sziget Festival in Hungary and Morocco’s Gnawa Festival to name a few. The band has shared the stage with music icons such as Hugh Masekela. – @ncubeleon
