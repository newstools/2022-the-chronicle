The visuals were shot by AlMit Media in Mutorashanga, Bushman Rock, Avondale, and Helensvale while the song was co-produced by Joshua Mtima and Spirit Fingers. The versatile group’s spokesperson, Ashley Mapfumo, said: “The song was inspired by the recent events in the Covid-19 era where people lost their loved ones, jobs and even marriages. “It’s also inspired by Proverbs 3: 5 and 6 which encourages us to always put our trust and hope in God. So even outside of Covid-19, there’re a lot of things that can make us want to give up so we are just there to say #HoldOn.” – @mthabisi_mthire
