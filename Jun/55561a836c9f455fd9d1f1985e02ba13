Dr Esat said due to his loyal service to the city, not only in business circles, but his involvement in community development, it was not a surprise that he and his family venture has been honoured. “It was about time that we get an award as we have been in business for over a century. “My father started the business in 1914 as a vendor pushing a cart and was later joined by my brothers. “He (my father) came to Zimbabwe in 1914 and in 1974 I was roped into the business as sort of an apprentice. “We have served the Bulawayo community for a long time and I’m glad that the chamber recognised our services and gave us this award.” Esat clothing mainly deals in school wear, kitchenware, linen, ladies’ hair and luggage. Dr Esat said customers stood with the family business during hyper-inflation era when certain products were not available. <img class="alignnone wp-image-621271 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-28-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-28-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-28-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “To all our customers, we are thankful for the resounding support they have given us over the years. “In good and bad times, they have supported us. We went through a phase where certain commodities were not available but they stood with us. To that end, the family empire has become a household brand and has employed hundreds of people throughout its existence. “I am glad that Esats store has become a household name in the city and country. We once had 10 branches in the city but we now have two. This is due to economic pressures as it became difficult to run chain stores,” said the businessman. Over the years, the businessman has donated to several charity organisations and has assisted the needy with food and other provisions.  During his long tenure as Bulawayo Councillor, Dr Esat was vocal on the implementation of the Lake Gwayi-Shangani project which is part of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project (NMZWP). This big dam is expected to provide a permanent solution to Bulawayo and Matabeleland region water challenges.
