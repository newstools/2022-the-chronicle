The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent Former Kwekwe Mayor, Angeline Kasipo has apologised for claiming that Kwekwe City Council officials had misused US$1 million set aside for the purchase of plant and equipment when she was still in office. Clr Kasipo was recalled last year but found her way back into the chambers when she reclaimed her Ward 10 seat during a March 26 by-election. <img class="alignnone wp-image-535249 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Angeline-Kasipo-Kwekwe-mayor.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Angeline-Kasipo-Kwekwe-mayor.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Angeline-Kasipo-Kwekwe-mayor-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Upon her return, Clr Kasipo accused Kwekwe City Council management of having “stolen” the said money that was meant for the purchase of a plant and equipment for the council. Clr Kasipo pointed a finger at Town Clerk Dr Lucia Mnkandla and Finance Director Mrs Rejoice Dandira, accusing them of having taken advantage of her recall to misuse the funds and called for accountability of the funds. Clr Kasipo even promised to bring evidence to council in the next meeting to the effect that there was US$1 million set aside for that purpose which had disappeared. <img class="wp-image-583172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> US dollar But asked to produce the evidence by fellow councilors during a recent full council meeting, Cllr Kasipo backtracked and quickly apologised. “I want to apologise for those claims because I didn’t gather my facts correctly. In fact, it was US$237 000 not US$1 million as earlier claimed. I want to sincerely apologise for the distortion which I found out after having gone through my minutes,” she said.  Clr Kasipo however, said she wanted to know how the money was used. “I however, demand answers as to what happened to the money since by the time left, we had already paid for the equipment. But up to today, we don’t have the equipment with us. What happened to the money?” she demanded. In response, Mrs Dandira produced bank and financial statements to the chamber showing that the transaction with Croco Motors was reversed but another deal was in the  pipeline. <img class="wp-image-617995 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-58-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-58-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-58-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Croco Motors “The money is still in our coffers after the deal between us and Croco Motors did not sail through. But let me hasten to say that we are in the process of securing another supplier and we have since added an ambulance to the equipment we are supposed to be purchasing,” said Mrs Dandira. Dr Mnkandla urged councillors to desist from making claims without evidence as it might affect the way other people operate. “We are different in the ways we react to issues. I urge us all to verify facts before we make claims. For example, the matter had already been covered by the media that we misused US$1 million. I am however, grateful to Clr Kasipo for the apology and we hope to continue working together for the better of our city,” said Dr Mnkandla.
