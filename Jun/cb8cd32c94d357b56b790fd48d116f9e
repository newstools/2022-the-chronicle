We are targeting young people in the arts sector, community development and business sectors between the ages of 15-35 years old. “The event is meant to promote entrepreneurship and legalisation of youth businesses, youth organisations and youths in the arts sector,” said Mpofu. <img class="wp-image-616578 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-218.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-218.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-218-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Youth Council He said at the expo, attendees will be offered services to register their organisations with the Zimbabwe Youth Council, National Arts Council of Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe Music Rights Association. “As Home Of Arts Entertainment, we’re inviting all young people around Bulawayo to take part in this expo.
