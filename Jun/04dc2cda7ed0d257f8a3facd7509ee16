THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) has up to tomorrow to lodge an appeal against the decision by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to nullify its January election that retained Joe Mujuru as president.  The SRC last month nullified the election results citing gross electoral irregularities in the process. In response, Buz through its lawyers Sengweni Legal Practice gave the SRC a seven-day ultimatum to settle the issue out of court. However, the seven working days have since lapsed and the SRC has not responded to the ultimatum meaning the matter will now be resolved in court. <img class="wp-image-610101 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-49-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-49-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-49-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Charmaine Chamboko Buz president Mujuru said: “We have not received any communication from SRC and our initial letter is clear on the stance that we will be taking if anything changes, we will advise.” In nullifying the election, the SRC stated that the Buz constitution does not provide for the National Association of Primary Heads (Naph) and National Association of Secondary Heads (Nash) voting rights, which automatically voids the two organisations’ vote. Buz, however, disputes the SRC’s decision. <img class="wp-image-617626 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-61-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Taurai Chitsinde The elections in dispute were held at Mtshabezi High School in Matabeleland South on January 29.
