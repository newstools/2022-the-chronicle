POPULAR comedian Ankela Zex Mdawini has again been the centre of attention after cracking a joke which suggested that he is a child molester. Social media is never a safe space and Ankela Zex found out the hard way last week when tweeps bayed for his blood because of a “pedophilic joke” he made at the Clive Chigubhu show. During his performance, Zex mentioned interaction with his neighbour’s daughter who sought help with her Biology homework. In helping “Samantha”, Mdawini said he then unzipped his trousers, pulled out his “manhood” and did some Biology practicals on the young girl, an insinuation of sexual intercourse with a minor. This joke did not sit down well with people on social media who were baying for his blood. The comedian from Pumula refuted the allegations and said, “I’m not a child molester. The Samantha in the joke is an imaginary and fictitious character that I made up. I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I don’t blame those who are fueling the smear campaign against my name. <img class="wp-image-445450 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/THE-National-Arts-Merit-Awards-Nama-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/THE-National-Arts-Merit-Awards-Nama-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/THE-National-Arts-Merit-Awards-Nama--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) “We love different things and against such a background, I want to inform my critics that I’ll not apologise for entertaining my type of followers. That joke was never explicit and vulgar, rather, it sounded so after my critics rephrased it,” said the reigning National Arts Merit Awards best comedian. The 53-year-old also opened a can of worms, suggesting that when it emerged that he was beaten early on in the year, all that was a prank. “A lot of people take me for a simpleton and they are yet to discover my type of comedy and pranks. I classify them as tragicomedy. “I was never beaten, but I actually swelled up my lips to look the part. I have an allergy and my lips swell when I eat a certain type of food which I haven’t identified yet, so I created that story to show my creativity,” said Ankela Zex. To Ankela Zex, comedians should be given carte blanche to say whatever they deem funny as the “main purpose of comedy is amusement, nothing else.” The self-proclaimed “controversial comedian” said he will not stop entertaining his fans because of “uncalled-for criticism.” “There is more from where that came from and I must reiterate, I’m not a pedophile. “That was a made-up joke meant for lovers of comedy. I’ll continue giving my fans what they deserve and that’s pure comedy.”  — @eMKlass_49
