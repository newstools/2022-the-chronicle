THERE is an urgent need to triple tourism growth from the current 4,5 percent of gross domestic product contribution to reach the target of a US$5 billion tourism economy by 2025, Cabinet has said. Following the Tourism Accounting Findings and Policy Implications report presented to Cabinet on Tuesday, it was resolved that Government agencies involved in the collection of tourism statistics would be strengthened by utilisation of digital platforms and collaboration. In line with the National Development Strategy, (NDS 1 2021-2025), the Government undertook to develop the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) in order to improve the accounting of the performance of the tourism sector. <img class="wp-image-613945 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money A technical working group led by the Zimbabwe National Statistical Agency (Zimstat) produced the TSA, an internationally adopted statistical tool for the measurement of tourism’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), trade and employment in an economy. Furthermore, the tool is expected to aid policy-makers in formulating evidence-based policies for a sustainable and resilient tourism industry post-Covid-19 to benefit players, Government and communities. In a post-Cabinet briefing on Tuesday, Information Communication Technology, Postal and Communication Services Minister, Jenfan Muswere said: “The nation is informed that the major findings of TSA are: that currently, tourism is contributing US$ 1 964 592 880 (4,5 percent) to GDP. <img class="alignnone wp-image-463056 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/National-Statistics-Agency-ZimStat.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/National-Statistics-Agency-ZimStat.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/National-Statistics-Agency-ZimStat-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “There is need to triple growth in the sector to reach the target of a US$5 billion tourism economy by 2025.”
Minister Muswere said the findings further revealed that the tourism sector directly employed 99 141 people in 2018, domestic tourism contributed US$765  724 073 compared to US$1 198 868 807 inbound tourism expenditure and should be supported. The sector has embarked on an aggressive domestic tourism marketing drive following the launch of the ZimBho campaign in 2020, which has helped improve domestic travel. The recovery is being enhanced by improved accessibility of tourism products and destination route connectivity in terms of domestic and international transportation.  To stimulate quick recovery, the Government has also come up with incentives such as the waiver of Value Added Tax on domestic tourism and duty exemption facility. These are meant to help improve access to tourism products and services by the domestic market through extended price reductions. Cabinet said collaboration among Government agencies involved in the collection of tourism statistics will be strengthened by utilisation of digital platforms and collaboration will be enhanced among the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, the Department of Immigration and other state actors. On the country’s participation at the Dubai Expo, Minister Muswere said the overall objectives were met through the main exhibition and complementary events. <img class="wp-image-613950 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-44-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dubai Expo “Feedback indicates that the overall objectives were met through the main exhibition and complementary events. However, key stakeholders are undertaking an appraisal of the country’s participation at the Expo. “Regarding the Invest, Trade and Visit Zimbabwe drive, a lot of inquiries were received during the period. “A number of Joint Venture Agreements were signed during the Expo.” Zimbabwe was one of the 192 countries that participated at Expo 2020 Dubai, where it showcased its unique opportunities in trade and investment, its distinct cultural heritage, socio-economic activities such as mining, tourism, agriculture, health, education, arts and culture among others.
