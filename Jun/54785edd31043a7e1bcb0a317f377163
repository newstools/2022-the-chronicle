Judgement Yard produced a number of mixtapes which also helped catapult them to stardom. DJ Fydale said he was excited to be hosting the ZiFM Stereo presenter. “We’ll have an afternoon gig in Gweru on the same day before we come to Mbizo 4 at The Club. It’ll be a reggae overdose for Midlands since we’ll be playing in two cities. We’re looking forward to the shows,” said Fydale.
