The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter BULAWAYO wholesalers and major supermarkets have been accused of diverting basic goods to the informal sector to mop up foreign currency leaving shelves of most supermarkets empty.  This, according to the consumer watchdog — the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) gives an impression that basic goods are in short supply. He said brands of big manufacturers are more easily found in the informal market than in supermarkets. Recently, the city has witnessed the sprouting of partitioned shops in several buildings stocked virtually with all basic commodities which are sold in foreign currency. This leaves consumers without access to foreign currency stranded. <img class="size-full wp-image-467744" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Mr-Comfort-Muchekeza.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Mr-Comfort-Muchekeza.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Mr-Comfort-Muchekeza-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Comfort Muchekeza Speaking to Business Chronicle yesterday, CCZ Matabeleland regional manager, Mr Comfort Muchekeza said they have noted the trend of informal markets stocked with basic goods but not available at major supermarkets.
