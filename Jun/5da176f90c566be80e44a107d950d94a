“Umahlekisa Roast shows are not meant to shame or embarrass artistes, but to promote their brands and help them to be confident about themselves by assisting them to own their own stories.” <img class="wp-image-520897 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Kudakwashe-Takundwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Kudakwashe-Takundwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Kudakwashe-Takundwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kudakwashe “Kuda” Takundwa This was said by Umahlekisa Comedy Club director Ntando Van Moyo in an interview ahead of a show dubbed “Roast of Novuyo Seagirl” scheduled for June 24 at the Hope Centre in Bulawayo.

Novuyo was next in line but the event was postponed following lockdown regulations in November last year. Now that the regulations have been relaxed, the show is set to resume. Commenting on the upcoming event, Ntando said the show, which only the brave can take up, is meant to boost artistes’ confidence and help them control their own narratives in an environment filled with rumour mongers. “We host these kind of events because we realised that there’s a need for artistes to stand up, celebrate and own their stories. <img class="wp-image-614793 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late rapper Cal Vin These shows are a way of celebrating, not just artistes, but personalities such as public figures as it helps them clear the air on any controversial issues or rumours that could be associated with them. It also gives them the opportunity to own their brands,” Ntando said. “It boosts dignity and confidence because, after the roast, no one should have anything to ask.” The comedian said there are a few changes to the show from the one that was meant to take place last year. <img class="wp-image-613249 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stewie Le Savage “For this one, we’ve changed the roast panel and added a few media personalities. We’ve also added a few of her ex-lovers to be part of the panel just to make it exciting. “We’ll also have up-and-coming comedians who’ll be curtain raisers for the main roast,” Ntando said. Media personalities who have been added are B-Metro’s Langalakhe Mabhena and NewsDay’s Sindiso Dube.
