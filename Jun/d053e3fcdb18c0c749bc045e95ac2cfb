The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter France-based Zimbabwean hip-hop artiste DenimWoods (born Abraham Lupwishi) is ready to conquer Africa and rub shoulders with some of the greatest the continent has to offer. The Zambia-born but Zimbabwe-bred rapper believes his latest song, “All I got” shows a statement of his intent and is “exciting”. <img class="wp-image-618880 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Denim-woods-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Denim-woods-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Denim-woods-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DenimWoods “I’m excited about this release because it’s been a minute since my last release. The goal is to conquer the African continent and be regarded as one of the best the hip-hop scene has ever seen. “Second best is not good enough so I need to keep on working hard and improving my craft to reach my dream,” he said. His new love song was released a fortnight ago on digital stores and is about his past “situationships”. “This song is all about my past situationships or relationships jumbled into one super ex. It was not just about one person, but rather, moments that correlate,” he said. <img class="wp-image-618877 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Denim-woods-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Denim-woods-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Denim-woods-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DenimWoods DenimWoods has been known for his verbal dexterity, well-thought-out lyrics, energetic performances, and charismatic persona.
