Silobela’s Chief Malisa told the visiting Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution Larry Mavima during a tour of the local authority’s projects recently that council was not consulting them in matters to do with development in the area. Chief Malisa said the RDC did not realise the contribution which chiefs could make in matters of development in their areas. “Council does not invite us to attend meetings that have to do with development which would benefit our communities. They work in isolation as if we do not exist. The local authority has not been consulting traditional leaders on matters of development in their areas of jurisdiction. “This exclusion by the council has been going on for a very long time and nothing has been done to change it. I was only invited to a certain project that is set to start in April after I complained that the council was sidelining us,” said the chief. Chief Malisa said management had also not explained to the traditional leaders how the devolution funds were being used in the district. “We do not know how the concept of devolution works and we are not even aware of how the funds from devolution are being used,” he said. Chief Ndabazinhle Gwasela said it is surprising that he was not consulted on the construction and even naming of Bhalimasvesve Primary School in his jurisdiction. <img class="wp-image-620002 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-56-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-56-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-56-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Ndabazinhle Gwasela He said the local authority must work with traditional leaders to help in the development of communities. “Most of these councillors do not attend ward assembly meetings, a platform which we can use to engage with them,” he said. Minister Mavima in response urged the local authority to work hand-in-hand with traditional leaders so that there is consensus in devolution programmes. “Economic development of the community needs a consented effort from the local community represented by its leaders such as chiefs. That way programmes that benefit the communities are identified and that brings transparency to the whole programme,” he said. Minister Mavima urged local authorities to utilise devolution funds to improve infrastructure and other service delivery initiatives in their districts. The minister toured the three local authorities in Kwekwe District which are Kwekwe, Redcliff and Zibagwe Rural District Council. “The devolution funds are not meant to be invested in the bank, rather they should be used to develop infrastructure and other service delivery initiatives. The funds should be used to initiate projects that would help create employment in the district as this would stimulate economic growth.  “Develop your infrastructure either using the intergovernmental funds or your own resources. That way you will be able to attract investors,” he said. Minister Mavima said the funds received by the rural local authorities were a reflection of the commitment by the Government to see the success of devolution.
