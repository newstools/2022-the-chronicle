VENDORS at Mtapa Fresh Produce Market in Gweru have turned Mtapa Cemetery into a toilet following failure by the local authority to construct ablution facilities. The market was established in March 2020 following a Cabinet directive to decongest vending places in line with Covid-19 regulations relocated the vendors from Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus and Kombayi Fresh Produce Market to a place opposite Mtapa Police Station. <img class="wp-image-614985 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-6-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-6-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-6-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mtapa Police Station Government directed local authorities to take advantage of the Covid-19 lockdown to restore order in cities, a development that resulted in new plans for Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus, Kombayi Fresh Produce Market as well as Ivene Market. There are more than 2 000 vendors dealing in fresh produce, clothes and hardware at the new market. Following Kudzanayi bus terminus renovations, less than 600 vendors were allocated vending stalls with the remainder finding a home at Mtapa Market. Vending stalls at Kombayi Market are still under construction forcing vendors to crowd Mtapa Market. Council is still to construct ablution facilities or supply running water. The market has no running water, no ablution facilities, no vending stalls or bays and the vendors leave their wares in the open, praying that no thieves steal. The vendors are now relieving themselves at Mtapa Cemetery . Vendors say the area has become a health disaster as the fresh produce traders from Gokwe and as far as Chipinge sleep at the market. Mrs Maria Sibanda, a vendor, said the market has become a health time bomb and urged the council to speed up upgrading of the market. “We are facing serious challenges at this market because of the unavailability of ablution facilities. We have over 2 000 vendors and we have no other alternative than to cross the road into Mtapa Cemetery,” she said. Gweru United Progressive Residents and Ratepayers Association Director Pastor David Chikore confirmed that vendors are resorting to open defecation.  “The truth of the matter is that Mtapa Cemetery has been turned into an open-air toilet by vendors. “The chaos that currently exists at the Mtapa Market is the legacy of outright greed by the space baron opportunists and an inept council that rolled over and allowed political interests to take over a council asset,” he said. Pastor Chikore said council is failing to construct ablution facilities, provide running water, and proper vending bays. He said space barons in March last year allocated bays to people without council’s approval leading to lawlessness and disorder at the market. “The same space barons made a killing by collecting cash ($1/day) from vendors at the market illegally. Council also contributed to the chaos by not being transparent in the registration process of vendors,” said Pastor Chikore. Zimbabwe Chamber for Small-to-Medium Enterprises Gweru chapter chairperson Mr Tafadzwa Mazorodze called on council to quickly provide water and construct ablution facilities for the vendors. “Working at Mtapa Market is actually a health hazard because there are no toilets and running water. Vendors bring their own water and have been hiring movable toilets. At one time they were parting with $180 per week to use the toilet. There are thousands of residents visiting the market and therefore the need for it to be user friendly,” he said. Mr Mazorodze said they wanted the council to regularise operations at the market for effective service delivery. Gweru City Council public relations and communications officer Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee said vendors have been allowed to use the ablution facilities at the Mtapa administration offices. <img class="wp-image-614994 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-8-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gweru City Council “While plans are underway for the construction of ablution facilities at Mtapa Market, council allowed them to use ablution facilities at our Mtapa administration offices. We don’t approve of open defaecation in bushes around the market or at Mtapa Cemetery,” she said. Ms Chingwaramusee said the construction of the ablution facilities is now 90 percent complete. “In the 2022 budget, $7,5 million was allocated towards the construction of Mtapa Market,” she said.
