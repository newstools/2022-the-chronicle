TOP United Nations Award-winning soldier Major Winnet Zharare is a classic example of the impact Zimbabweans have around the world, President Mnangagwa has said.  Major Zharare (39), was last week honoured by the United Nations with a UN Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award for her outstanding efforts to integrate gender perspectives into peacekeeping activities. She had been on a 17-month United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan which ended in April this year. She received her award at the United Nations headquarters in New York, United States last week, in the process becoming the first Zimbabwean to receive such recognition. <img class="size-full wp-image-613551" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/United-Nations-headquarters-in-New-York.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/United-Nations-headquarters-in-New-York.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/United-Nations-headquarters-in-New-York-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> United Nations headquarters in New York “A true Zimbabwean inspiration.

She worked as a Protocol Officer from 2015 to 2019, after which she was nominated for deployment in UNMISS as a Military Observer in Bentiu, South Sudan, fulfilling roles including Chief Information Officer, Training Officer, and Gender Focal Point. Her tour of duty ended in April 2022.
