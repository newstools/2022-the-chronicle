A total of 103 athletes have secured free slots availed by organisers of the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon for long distance runners based in Bulawayo and Matabeleland North. Organisers of the marathon, Wild Frontiers, are offering 160 free slots for athletes based in the two provinces. The deadline for registration is June 19. To secure a free slot, athletes have to be Econet subscribers and must register through the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab). <img class="alignnone wp-image-613317 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ECONET.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ECONET.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ECONET-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The athletes will, however, have to organise their own transport and accommodation in Victoria Falls. Bab chairperson Watson Madanyika said: “We are calling for more athletes to come and register for free before June 19. In the event that we get to the 160 mark before deadline day we will close the registration. We are happy with the response we have received from athletes in the two provinces as we registered the 103 athletes in seven days.”  The marathon is returning to the premier resort city after a two-year absence caused by Covid-19. It was held as a virtual marathon last year after Covid-19 restrictions were eased. Registration fees for Zimbabwean athletes is US$5 for the 7,5km Lion route, US$10 for the 21km Leopard route and US$15 for the 42km Elephant route. Athletes from the Sadc bloc will pay US$5 for the Lion route, US$30 for the Leopard route and US$40 for the Elephant route, while those from outside the Sadc region will pay US$10, US$50 and US$60 respectively for the three routes respectively. <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 Meanwhile, Wild Frontiers called on all athletes and staff at the event to adhere to Covid-19 protocols as set out by the Government during the time of the event.
