THERE is need to prioritise the rehabilitation of roads leading to irrigation schemes in Matabeleland South province as Government moves to industrialise rural areas. Some irrigation schemes such as Sebasa in Gwanda South are in remote areas where roads and bridges are badly damaged, making it difficult for farmers to move produce and access other services. <img class="alignnone wp-image-614118 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Irrigation schemes are business units expected  to attract further investment from the private sector and other relevant stakeholders. Speaking during a briefing at Sebasa Irrigation Scheme in Gwanda District on Wednesday, Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said accessibility is a key driver to the success of irrigation schemes. “While it is important to ensure that our irrigation schemes are well-equipped, we also need to make sure that they’re accessible. The roads leading to this irrigation scheme are very bad and need attention. Think of a situation where a truckload of produce needs to be transported to the market; these roads present a challenge,” said Deputy Minister Haritatos. <img class="wp-image-612009 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> irrigation schemes He said the rehabilitation of Sebasa Irrigation Scheme is expected to uplift the livelihoods of farmers in the area. “As such, they will be part of an empowered upper middle-income society. However, this can only be achieved by focusing on improved production, productivity and farming as a business. This will in turn enhance income, increase opportunities for value addition and the development of agribusiness value chains,” said Deputy Minister Haritatos. Meanwhile, various critical roads in Matabeleland South province have been rehabilitated under the extended Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme Phase 2 (ERRP2). Government launched the ERRP 2 programme to rehabilitate roads that had been damaged by rains in the past season. <img class="wp-image-507456 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Mr-Moment-Malandu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Mr-Moment-Malandu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Mr-Moment-Malandu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DDF Matabeleland South provincial coordinator Mr Moment Malandu The programme has rescued most local authorities as they had been failing to rehabilitate roads. The reconstruction of roads is an economic enabler and a driver towards the attainment of the Government’s vision to achieve an upper middle-income economy by 2030. The Mbembeswana-Marinoha Road in Matobo District was rehabilitated through the District Development Fund (DDF), building on the momentum which started last year to upgrade key infrastructure. DDF Matabeleland South provincial co-ordinator Mr Moment Malandu said the target of rehabilitating 62 kilometres of the road which was set last year was completed. “We graded 32 kilometres and gravelled 30 kilometres of the road. We’re now working on rehabilitating the remaining 10 kilometres of the road. We’re also working on several other road projects in Matabeleland South province with some of them already completed,” said Mr Malandu.  He said DDF graders are currently in Insiza District working on various roads. “We’ve graded the Montrose-Phaphama-Virginia 51-kilometre stretch in Insiza District. We have also done the Ekusileni nine-kilometre stretch, Mahole six-kilometre stretch and 30 kilometres of the Phambuka-Gwatemba Road,” said Mr Malandu. “In Bulilima District, work has been done to rehabilitate 37 kilometres of Bhilingoma Road and we’re now doing the Moza-Ntoli-Phakama Road. We also completed the Moza-Tokwana Road which is 11 kilometres. In Mangwe, we have completed the rehabilitation of the Sanzukwe-Majongwana Road which is eight kilometres.” He said various roads in Umzingwane and Gwanda districts have also been rehabilitated under ERRP 2. “Irisvale Road in Umzingwane District which is 32 kilometres was also rehabilitated. All these roads are under the ERRP 2 programme initiated by the Government,” said Mr Malandu. – @Yolisswa
