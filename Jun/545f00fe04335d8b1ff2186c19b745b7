In an interview with Saturday Leisure, the Ngeke Bengimele singer said recording a song for Bosso felt right adding that the track was dedicated to certain personnel within the club. “I’m passionate about celebrating anything local and this one is a dedication to all Bosso fans. Highlanders FC has given our young soccer stars a home and my young brother Muziwakhe Dlamini is part of the midfield third in the team. “I was also inspired by the appointment of a young CEO and other young people,” said Awa. “That is something worth celebrating and I think as young people, we should continue supporting the team in any way we can. That’s how we’ll grow.”  She added: “I also love how the team has given people a sense of belonging and the unity phrase ‘iTeam yezwe lonke’. According to Awa, fellow artiste, Elvis Sibbs from Khox Entertainment suggested that she records the song in 2020. “He paired me up with DJ Jabs and I fell in love with the instrumental he had made. I wrote the song in less than 30 minutes. <img class="size-full wp-image-593129" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/musi99.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/musi99.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/musi99-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Music – image taken from Shutterstock My creative juices were flowing that day and since I’m a Bosso fan, I had many reasons to celebrate the team.” The rapper said she also felt compelled to release music to appease her fans who have complained about her seasonal release of new content. “I haven’t been releasing music and many people have been complaining about it. Sometimes, it’s the perfectionist in me or the procrastination curse, but I’ve finally decided to release songs I recorded and kept in the studio because music is meant to be enjoyed,” she said. Later on this year, Awa who has been featured in quite a number of local songs including Msiz’kay’s Ngawuzw’umoya wami as well as Leo_Magozz, Bling 4 and Brian Jeck’s Fire Emoji remix will be releasing an EP called Queen Energy.
