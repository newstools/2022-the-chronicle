THE Zifa Restructuring Committee will hold its Bulawayo stakeholder consultative forum at Milton Junior School on Tuesday next week. The meeting will start at 2pm and members of the public are urged to attend and make inputs that will lead to the publication of a strategic report outlining a forward-looking plan for developing football in Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-616440 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-205.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-205.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-205-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zifa The committee has already held consultations with the Zifa secretariat, Premier Soccer League, Zimbabwe Soccer Coaches Association (Zisca), Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (Fuz), Zimbabwe Women’s Soccer League and the Mighty Warriors’ technical team, among others. The restructuring committee is hard at work trying to reform Zimbabwe’s troubled football landscape, as it continues to engage the public through hearings on different platforms as part of a wider consultative process. With just under a year to complete its mission of crafting a blueprint widely expected to chart a new refreshing chapter for local football, the committee believes it will need the input of all well-meaning Zimbabweans in its audacious bid.  The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) set up the committee in December with a view to tackle matters of a strategic nature, as outlined in the terms of reference in line with the provisions of Section 21, 19(b), and 20 (c) of the SRC Act. <img class="wp-image-616444 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-207.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-207.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-207-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) Harare lawyer Blessing Rugara leads the nine-member committee that includes former Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) chief executive officer and International Federation World Rowing development manager Anna Mguni, international sports expert Tommy Sithole, banker Desmund Ali, lawyer Rudo Mugandani and Doves Holdings general manager marketing Joel Gombera, former Caps United administrator Joyce Kapota, Caps United legend and former defender Charles “Raw Meat” Sibanda are also part of the committee, whose operations are being funded by the SRC. – @innocentskizoe
