HWANGE Colliery Company will on Monday commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kamandama Mine disaster which claimed 427 miners following an underground methane gas explosion in 1972 amid calls by chiefs in the district for Government to declare the day a national day of mourning. The disaster is the 9th worst mine disaster in the world with the 1942 Benxihu Colliery mine disaster in China which claimed 1 549 lives topping the unfortunate list. The Kamandama mine disaster commemorations return after two years as the country battled the effects of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic which saw the Government enforcing a national lockdown including banning public gatherings in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus. <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 “We will be holding the commemoration on the 6th of June 2022,” said HCC spokesperson Beauty Mutombe. In separate interviews, Chief Shana, Chief Nekatambe and Chief Nelukoba all said June 6 deserves to be a national day of mourning. Chief Nekatambe said if it wasn’t possible to make it national, then at least it can be localised in Hwange district. “That was a huge disaster that occurred in Hwange, 427 lives lost in a single disaster is just too many. The disaster cut across a number of countries as people of different nationalities perished that day. It will really be a noble and respectful move by Government if this day is remembered nationally,” said Chief Shana.  Chief Nekatambe said the request for the day to be declared a national holiday was made long back and people were still hopeful that it will be acceded to. “A total of 427 miners perished in this disaster and these people were contributing to the country’s economic growth hence the need to recognise this unfortunate incident. The day should be nationally remembered and it will be excellent if Government heeds the people’s call,” said Chief Nekatambe. Speaking on the same issue, Chief Nelukoba said declaring June 6 as a national day of mourning would also bring closure to the surviving families. <img class="wp-image-614263 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-78.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-78.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-78-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clouds of poisonous gas “We really need to remember those people not just by gathering at the site for a few hours but it must be a national holiday,” said Chief Nelukoba. Hwange Colliery Company has religiously remembered the day every year and has been taking care of the 72 surviving widows. It is only during the past two years that stakeholders could not gather at the mine to observe the day due to the Covid-19 induced lockdowns prohibiting public gatherings. <img class="wp-image-610438 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-104.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-104.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-104-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mine- Image taken from Shutterstock At exactly 10.25am on the day of the commemorations, a minute of silence is observed in memory of the miners. It is the time that the first explosion occurred. Further explosions on June 7 poured clouds of poisonous gas into the 4,8km tunnel, making further rescue attempts impossible. On June 9, the then general manager of Wankie Colliery, Gordon Livingstone-Blevins decided to leave the 427 bodies underground. The disaster led to a turnaround shift on mine safety measures not only for Hwange Colliery Company but the whole mining sector.
