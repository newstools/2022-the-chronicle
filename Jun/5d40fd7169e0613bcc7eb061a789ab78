Miss Member Vushe (28) of Vugwi Village under Chief Mazvihwa’s area in Zvishavane, Midlands Province, is no longer going to give birth at home risking her life and that of her baby as a new maternity waiting shelter has been constructed at Vugwi Clinic. <img class="wp-image-615199 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-33-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-33-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-33-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chitumba Pic-Zanu PF’s Women’s League national political commissar, Cde Maybe Mbowa (with spectacles) gets to feel one of the beds at Vugwi clinic She has given birth twice at her homestead, risking her life and those of her children. Ms Vushe is one of the many expecting women who will benefit from the US$15 000 new maternity waiting shelter at Vugwi Clinic funded by former Zvishavane-Runde MP Fred Moyo (Zanu-PF). The shelter was officially opened at the weekend. “This waiting shelter will be a place of hope, opportunity, and the dawn of an optimistic future. It’s not about a gleaming waiting room, with air conditioning, mounted televisions, beautiful furniture, and or custom-made beds. But it’s more about a basic space with a simple bed, clean environment and a welcoming atmosphere for pregnant and expecting mothers,” she said. Ms Vushe said the 12-bed maternity waiting shelter is a great investment for the villagers. Maternity waiting shelters where expectant women can stay during their last six weeks of pregnancy, have become critical in saving lives in rural Zimbabwe. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615016 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Delivering from home has numerous risks which can lead to death. “I am very happy with this shelter for pregnant women,” said Ms Vushe. Like most rural women, Ms Vushe has been facing numerous challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare services. She said during the rain season when the roads are impassable, there are no ambulance services at all and women have to walk long distances to seek help at clinics. An elated Chief Mazvihwa said the provision of maternity waiting shelter will help in reducing maternal and perinatal mortality. He said there will be improved access to skilled birth attendance and emergency specialised care, particularly for women in his area. “Shelters help rural women to get ante-natal check-ups, newborn care and identifying problems during labour. Maternity shelters are designed to prevent haemorrhage, which health experts say is the major contributor of deaths for women during delivery,” said Chief Mazvihwa. “We are extremely happy for expecting mothers. Gone are the days of traversing mountainous Mazvihwa terrain to reach a facility with obstetric services, the delay can be significant. If a woman experiences a complication with rapid onset, even a delay of several hours can be fatal. Such emergencies cannot be easily predicted.” Cde Moyo said the idea to have the maternity waiting shelter was to prevent mortality incidence for both mother and baby resulting from the mother presenting herself for delivery late.  “The delay is caused by unavailability of accommodation for expecting mothers at the clinics like here at Vugwi. Clinics only have delivery rooms. The situation is further complicated by the fact that these mothers have to walk long distances of up to 7-10km coupled with cases of sudden labour pains especially for young first time mothers,” he said. Cde Moyo said he felt the need to construct mothers’ waiting area at the clinics. “This is the first shelter and more are coming. The shelters would be open space structures capable of accommodating up to 12 mothers at any time. The shelter would be supported by a cooking area, toilets and a bathing cubicle,” he said. Cde Moyo said the shelter in question was the first chosen on the basis of its wide catchment  that involves five wards namely Indaba, Mhototi, Mutambi, Sabi and Rupemba. He said there were also some people coming from adjacent wards in Mberengwa and Chivi. “The facility is in Indaba Ward (Vugwi area) under the jurisdiction of Chief Mazvihwa. Vugwi Clinic is electrified and has consistent potable water and is serviced by a good road network. The structure cost US$15 000 to build and equip. Part of the cost includes bricks moulded by the community plus labour provided by community builders,” said Cde Moyo. “It is my belief that similar units must be built in every ward such that no woman walks beyond their ward to go and deliver when time comes. Clinics that support the shelters are already well manned by qualified nurses who provide both pre- and post-maternity services. No one should die in the process of giving birth itself a service to the nation,” he said. Maternal mortality ratio – deaths associated with pregnancy or childbirth per 100 000 live births – has proven to be one of the most intractable indicators in the developing world. Zanu-PF’s Women’s League national political commissar, Cde Maybe Mbowa who was the guest of honour commended Cde Moyo for coming up with the shelter for the good of the community. She said the positive development resonates well with the Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo mantra pushed by President Mnangagwa. <img class="wp-image-605100 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa “This is a beautiful investment for the pregnant women, for the community and country at large. We should all make it a point that we contribute to national development, starting from where we stay like what Cde Moyo and this community are doing. This is a welcome development,” said Cde Mbowa. Midlands State University (MSU) deputy director of health services Dr Wilson Mpariwa said it is important that women continue to use health centres for the safety of both the mother and baby. “Women are encouraged to continue utilising the services of waiting homes as these were meant to ensure that in their vulnerable state, they were close to health practitioners and could be easily monitored,” he said. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) 2019 report, Zimbabwe recorded a decline in maternal mortality rate from 614 to 462 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies since 2014. The significant drop is in part attributed to pregnancy waiting shelters.
