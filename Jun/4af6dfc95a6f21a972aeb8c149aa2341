The top five from this heat progressed to the semi-finals and Smith’s time was the leading time in all five heats. Sixteen swimmers from the five heats advanced to the semi-finals that was scheduled for late yesterday. Katai’s entry time was 1 minute 02,73 seconds, a personal best she set during the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games last year. However, she could not replicate the same performance yesterday. Her next event is the 50m backstroke tomorrow. Other members of Team Zimbabwe are Nomvula Mjimba, Denilson Cyprianos and Liam Davis. Mjimba joined the team at the weekend and is competing in the 100m and 50m freestyle. She is up for competition on Wednesday when she contests the 100m freestyle and will wrap up her events in the 50m freestyle on Friday. <img class="wp-image-617950 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nomvula Mjimba Katai, Mjimba and Cyprianos are all beneficiaries of the IOC Olympic Solidarity Paris 2024 Scholarships. Through the support of the IOC, the Olympic Solidarity Scholarship funding offers assistance to National Olympic Committees (NOCs) for direct athlete support towards preparation and qualification for the Olympic Games. And the trio are among the athletes Zimbabwe is hoping will attain qualifying standards for the 2024 Olympic Games.  Davis, who is based in Edinburgh, Scotland, is expected to compete in the men’s 200m breaststroke and his event is scheduled for Wednesday. Coach Masi Takaedza, who is in charge of the team at the competition, said they are hoping to see the swimmers improving their times and Fina points for future selection purposes. “To improve their PBs (personal best) and rankings, it also gives them an opportunity to improve their Fina points for future selections,” said Takaedza.
