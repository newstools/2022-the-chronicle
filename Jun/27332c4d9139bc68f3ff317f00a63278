A 65-YEAR-OLD pensioner from Tshabalala suburb in Bulawayo is appealing for help to take care of four-year-old triplets, born to his daughter who is a single mother. The two girls and a boy were brought to Mr Salila Sibanda and his wife last month as their daughter who is job seeking in South Africa failed to fend for them.  The triplets were born in the neighbouring country and their father, a Nigerian, disappeared. Next year the trio should start ECD A and Mr Sibanda said he had no means to take them even to the cheapest school in the area or buy uniforms. The mother of the triplets, aged 30 has two older children, one who is also under the care of her parents. Her fifth child is living with his paternal grandparents in the rural areas. Narrating his ordeal to Chronicle yesterday, Mr Sibanda said the triplets were dropped off by their mother three weeks ago who said she was no longer capable of fending for them. The pensioner said he is sometimes forced to babysit the children as the family cannot afford a helper. “I find it inappropriate to be bathing my two granddaughters and when I am all alone I just wash their faces and wait for their grandmother. If I had means I would seek help elsewhere so that they are well taken care of. My heart bleeds because we sometimes fail to buy soap and baby food which they need like other babies,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-613969" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/triplet-grandchildren.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/triplet-grandchildren.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/triplet-grandchildren-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The triplets grandchildren “My measly pension can only buy us mealie-meal, sugar and a few grocery items. We are renting this house and life has become unbearable, I don’t even know what to do as I have reached my retirement age.” He said the mother of the triplets is still trying to find her feet in South Africa. “As much as I wish she had been more responsible, there is no way she was going to cope with three children without support from the father. These triplets bring the total of her children to five and we cannot bank on her promises as previously she has left us to fend for her other children all by ourselves,” said Mr Sibanda. He said the children have no birth certificates or any document to use when seeking enrolment places at school. “These triplets are turning four this October meaning that next year they should start ECD A. Already we are struggling with our oldest grandson who is in Grade Four and we couldn’t qualify for the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM).” Mr Sibanda said the family had tried to apply for BEAM but the school did not respond. “Over the past years, my daughter has failed to even send us food or at least money to buy clothes or uniforms for her eldest son that we are taking care of. Now that we have three more of her children we know that she will not even do anything hence our appeal for help,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-612360" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa “We know there may be well-wishers out there who may chip in and help us since we are struggling. We also appeal to the Mother of the Nation Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa to consider helping these children to at least go to school and have decent meals like others.” The family needs clothes, school fees, food and uniforms for the children. “Those willing to help may contact us on +263777161075 and we will appreciate any kind of help to alleviate our dire situation,” added Mr Sibanda.–@thamamoe
