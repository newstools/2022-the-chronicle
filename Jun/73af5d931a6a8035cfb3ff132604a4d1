ZIMBABWE has been moved from a low risk to a moderate Covid-19 risk travel destination and health officials have urged citizens to strictly adhere to preventive measures saying complacency can be disastrous. Destinations carrying the Level 2 Covid-19 Moderate designation reported 50 to 100 Covid-19 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All along the Zimbabwe had been on Level 1 but a surge in cases over the past week resulted in the CDC moving Zimbabwe to level 2. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 cells As of Monday, Zimbabwe had 254 268 confirmed cases, including 246 719 recoveries and 5 523 deaths. To date, a total of 6 252 511 people have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccines, 4 585 843 their second while 841 330 have received their third dose. A total of 5 5 13 new Covid-19 cases have been recorded in Zimbabwe during the past 28 days. “Just two countries were moved to Level Two and these are Guatemala and Zimbabwe. Home to beautiful Lake Atitlán and Mayan ruins, Guatemala was at Level 3 last week. The move was bad news for safari destination Zimbabwe in southern Africa as it had been at Level 1,” said CDC in a report. Contacted for comment, Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Dr John Mangwiro said people should never forget how the virus operates as witnessed during the past waves when people relaxed only to wake up to a rise in cases and deaths. <img class="wp-image-618445 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-67-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-67-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-67-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vaccinated He said the CDC placement is a reminder of how things can go out of control if members of the public become complacent. “We continue to encourage residents to get vaccinated as we have enough doses for everyone. We have learnt in the past that the situation can dramatically change from low cases to a crisis. Being moved from level 1 to 2 shows that we are still at risk and therefore we cannot afford to be complacent.” said Dr Mangwiro. – @thamamoe.
