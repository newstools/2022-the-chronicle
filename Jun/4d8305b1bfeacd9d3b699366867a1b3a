PENSIONERS in Gwanda are buoyant over the establishment of a goat rearing outgrower project in Matshetsheni to cushion their livelihoods. The project, which is meant to generate income to supplement pension pay-outs, was set up through the National Social Security Authority (Nssa). Pensioners have also benefited from a fully equipped mobile clinic and other non-monetary benefits such as grocery allowances, discounted grocery schemes with SPAR and the OK group of stores, a waiver of bank charges for Nssa pensioners who bank with NBS and POSB as well as a revolving fund with POSB and NBS where pensioners can get loans at subsidised rates for income-generating projects. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-612136" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/NSSA-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/NSSA-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/NSSA-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This month, pensioners are expected to receive a once-off grocery allowance of $10 000 and a cushioning allowance equivalent to one month’s pension. Some of the beneficiaries of the goat rearing outgrower project said despite having retired from formal employment, they still had the capacity to work with their hands. “The fact that I’m a pensioner doesn’t mean I can no longer work for my family. Some of us in our early 60s are still active and can work. With such farming projects, you know that on a rainy day, you can sell a goat and use the money to meet some of your needs,” said Mr Regis Mare, one of the pensioners. He said for pensioners who are advanced in age, projects such as this one were useful as they are not labour intensive. “One continues to make money as long as the goats continue to multiply. You eventually get to a point where you can hire someone to take care of the goats for you and enjoy the benefits while relaxing,” said Mr Mare. <img class="size-full wp-image-618190" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mr-Regis-Mare.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mr-Regis-Mare.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mr-Regis-Mare-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Regis Nare Another pensioner, Ms Beauty Ndlovu said when her husband died in the early 2000s, he left young children who were still in primary school. “The pension was never enough and during that time, we didn’t have such projects to supplement pay-outs so it was a struggle. It was difficult to get by but with this goat project, I can now rest. Although my children are now grown, we still have to eat and pay bills so income generated from goat farming will surely go a long way,” said Mrs Ndlovu. Nssa general manager Mr Arthur Manase said empowerment projects such as goat farming outgrower schemes are meant to enable generation of extra income. “Conscious of the fact that social security pay-outs can never be sufficient anywhere in the world, Nssa went a step further by coming up with various non-monetary benefits in collaboration with its partners,” said Mr Manase. <img class="size-full wp-image-618193" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Ms-Beauty-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Ms-Beauty-Ndlovu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Ms-Beauty-Ndlovu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Beauty Ndlovu “As Nssa, we’re determined to enrich the lives of our pensioners. We’ve committed to periodic pension reviews. We know that pensions will never be adequate so we’re continuing with our struggle to ensure that pensioners have other income-generating activities to embark on to make sure that they improve their livelihoods. “We’re continuing with our revolving loans so that pensioners can start income-generating projects. We’re continuing with our goat rearing projects which will create additional revenue streams for pensioners. We’re also engaging in economic activities which will also afford pensioners added revenue. We have a mobile clinic where pensioners can receive quality medical care. Some projects will be announced soon where pensioners can be our partners and that way, we enhance their livelihoods.” — @Yolisswa
