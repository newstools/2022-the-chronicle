THE Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) is expected to develop irrigation equipment infrastructure as part of its new thrust while playing an active role in ensuring the country achieves rural industrialisation. The water parastatal has rebranded its services and has introduced a new logo and a new payoff line “For Communities: For Development” from its past one which was “Water is Life, Every Drop Counts.” Zinwa is now expected to provide water to all the country’s 35 000 villages to enhance food security in line with President Mnangagwa’s rural industrialisation programme. <img class="wp-image-605100 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Responding to questions from Chronicle, Zinwa corporate communications and marketing manager Mrs Marjorie Munyonga said the parastatal has assumed a new identity to reflect the transformation and evolution it has gone through since its formation 22 years ago. “The rebranding is in tandem with Zinwa’s new strategic thrust and direction and the new and prominent role the authority is now expected to play in the realisation of a water secure, climate-proof and drought-proof nation. This new strategic direction means Zinwa is expected to play a more pronounced role in the transformation of livelihoods and the socio-economic development of communities across Zimbabwe; hence its new payoff line; For Communities: For Development,” said Mrs Munyonga.  She said under the new thrust, Zinwa should show the centrality of water as a critical enabler of socio-economic development and the improvement of people’s standards of living. Mrs Munyonga said under the new mandate, no community should lack access to water. “Zinwa has also been tasked with spearheading the Presidential Rural Development Programme where it is expected to drill and equip 35 000 boreholes in the country’s 35 000 villages in a development that will help unlock opportunities and improve access to water for rural communities. The boreholes will provide water for communal drinking needs, for the establishment of nutrition gardens, fishery projects, orchards and water for dip tanks,” said Mrs Munyonga. <img class="wp-image-615696 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zinwa corporate communications and marketing manager Mrs Marjorie Munyonga She said at its formation Zinwa was expected to provide raw water to irrigating farmers up to the field edge but now it is expected to provide necessary infrastructure for communities to access water. Mrs Munyonga said in line with the Government’s devolution thrust, Zinwa has opened offices in Gwanda, Bindura and Chinhoyi. In the past, Zinwa has administrative offices in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo and Mutare. “However, beginning in 2019, Government reviewed the mandate of Zinwa to include the development of irrigation infrastructure inclusive of infield works. To help improve service delivery, Zinwa further decentralised its operations from the catchment system to the service centre system in which it now runs, in addition to the seven catchment offices, 20 service centres across Zimbabwe. This has since improved Zinwa’s responsiveness to issues affecting clients and also increased clients’ access to Zinwa services,” Mrs Munyonga. She said Zinwa’s rebranding is in sync with the President Mnangagwa’s Vision 2030 of an upper middle-income economy. <img class="alignnone wp-image-615694 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-51-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-51-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-51-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The rebranding prepares Zinwa to occupy its rightful place in the attainment of this vision as it transforms into a customer focused organisation capable of ensuring a water secure nation; which in itself is a precondition for the realisation of Vision 2030,” she said.
