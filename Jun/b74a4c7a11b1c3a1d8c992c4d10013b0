UK-based gospel artiste Pastor Matildah Tekeshe has released three singles from her forthcoming album Seasons which features sensations Sebastian Magacha and Mellisa “Mai Advisor” Makwasha. The album was produced by the talented Macdonald “MacDee” Chidavaenzi. The pastor, who has already released other songs such as Makagadzirira Here?, Munopindura Minamato and Mutsvene from the album said she is putting final touches to the album which will be her fifth. <img class="wp-image-622678 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sebastian Magacha Her debut album Kugona KwaMwari was recorded in 2002 followed by Mukana Uripo in 2015, The Kingdom of God in 2018 with her fourth Jehovah Yahweh, being released in 2020. With the forthcoming album, she is hoping to get the much-needed mileage given the poor marketing that saw her previous works receiving little rotation on local airwaves. “Marketing has been a major setback in my music career. Some projects, especially my first two projects, were not marketed well, and it’s been a struggle to be heard, but doors are slowly opening now and I give glory to God,” she said. <img class="wp-image-622705 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obert Mazivisa The songs she has released thus far are a mixed bag and will certainly appeal to a wider audience. Makagadzirira Here? is a laid-back worship song that calls on the Lord to help his people in prayer through the Holy Spirit. This slow number will definitely be a hit with worship song lovers as it is deep and pulls at heart strings. On a Jit tip, Tauya Baba is poised to light-up weddings, due to its catchy and fast-paced beat. Other songs that gospel lovers should look out for from the album are Masuwo featuring Magacha, Mbiri Nerumbidzo, Munopindura Minamato, Mutsvene Ndinewe which features Obert Mazivisa and You are Holy. Like all her previous works, her latest production was recorded in Zimbabwe, with the artiste saying it was difficult to get fellow artistes in the UK to commit to the recording due to work commitments. Seasons was recorded at Eternity Production, engineered and produced by the celebrated producer, Macdee.  “We have a number of talented musicians abroad, but time and availability is always a struggle which is quite challenging when you want to do a project. I always find it easier to do my productions back home,” Tekeshe said. Makwasha from the acclaimed choral group ZimPraise is on lead vocals, together with Patience Masiyambiri Mandizha. <img class="wp-image-622684 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Patience Masiyambiri Wellington Mutepaire and Tinashe Mutemererwa are on lead and bass guitars respectively
Tekeshe’s talent was discovered at age 13 when she gave her life to Christ and started singing at the school assembly, Scripture Union, and her church’s praise and worship team. She has been active on the UK music scene, with a successful concert in Bedford UK in 2017 being one of the highlights of her career. She ministers at a number of church conferences too. “My desire is that this gospel through music will be heard worldwide,” she said. The artiste is married and has three daughters whom she says support her music career. “I do take time off music to be with the family and when I’m doing music tours, concerts, and projects – my husband, children, and family are always there to support me,” said Tekeshe.
