The Chronicle Master KG continues to win. Last year, when their song Jerusalema reached 200 million views, they thought things could not get better. But two years after it was released, the song continues to soar. Kgaogelo “Master KG” Moagi has announced that his single, Jerusalema with Nomcebo Zikode has hit the record-breaking 500 million mark views on YouTube, making it one of the most-watched music videos to be released in South Africa. “I honestly didn’t expect my song to be this big,” he tells Drum. The catchy song travelled around the world at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic as a soothing balm to a world that was in lockdown. Several versions and interpretations of Jerusalema were released and shared on social media. “This song is God-given, it keeps doing the unexpected.”  When making music, Master KG says he tries to not compare his songs with Jerusalema, but it becomes difficult as he also wishes for other songs to reach high standards. “I try as much as I can to not compare or compete. When I drop a song, I don’t anticipate that anything will do better than Jerusalema. I just make sure that it’s produced and mixed well. Anything else, we’ll see after.” Since then, Master KG has released more chart-topping hits, most recently Sofa Silahlane by Wanitwa Mos, Master KG; Lowsheen featuring Nkosazana Daughter; and Dali Nguwe by Wanitwa Mos and Master KG featuring Nkosazana Daughter, Basetsana and Obeey Amor. However, the milestone is bitter-sweet for Master KG, as there is still an ongoing dispute regarding the ownership of the song. Last year, Nomcebo said she had “not been paid a cent by the label for Jerusalema despite the song’s global success”. “I have been ridiculed, with efforts to marginalise my contribution,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-617890 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-46-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-46-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-46-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Master KG does not want to focus on the negative and says the matter is between the record label and Nomcebo. “There is no drama with me and Nomcebo, just a misunderstanding here and there. The issues are with her and Open Mic, not me. We don’t have an issue, well, from my side. She said she was not paid. At the end of the day, the masters are owned by Open Mic, both her and I are just performing artistes, and they need to resolve the issue with splits and stuff.” Master KG says they haven’t spoken in a while but like each other’s posts on social media. “We haven’t spoken in a long time, I see her posts and I like them. I also understand that she is busy, and we are always touring. Maybe soon, when the matter is resolved we will get together and celebrate the success of the song.” <img class="wp-image-617896 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-49-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-49-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-49-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nkosazana Daughter However, Master KG says he would love to get back in the studio with Nomcebo. “I would definitely like to make more music with Nomcebo in the future. She has her own unique style and her own way of making things happen. I believe the success of the song was not from one side. It was me  and her getting together and making it happen.” <img class="wp-image-617893 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obeey Amor. Generally, Master KG has a lot to celebrate this year as he is also nominated for a South African Music Award (Sama), after being snubbed last year and going on social media to vent. “I would love to get Record of the Year, but I don’t think too much about awards. People tend to think I have an issue with the Samas, I just don’t understand how they are run and how they make their selections. If I had an issue, I was going to say they must not nominate me at all,” he says. With celebration and success comes criticism. Just a few weeks ago Master KG and singer Makhadzi were reported to have broken up. But the Dali Nguwe producer says that could not be far from the truth. “We have not broken up. We are still dating,” he says. “There are too many rumours out there. We have just been working hard. “She is going to be featured on my upcoming album and I feature in hers. We have a good working relationship and a healthy personal relationship too and maybe when the time is right, we might also discuss marriage, who knows.” — Drum
