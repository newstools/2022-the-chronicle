The Chronicle Leading short-term insurance firm Moovah has urged motorists to sign up for its comprehensive car insurance policy to protect themselves against loss emanating from unforeseen circumstances. Most vehicle owners in Zimbabwe take up third party insurance, which is compulsory and covers liability for injuries or property damage caused on others, up to a specific limit. However, third party insurance does not cover one’s own vehicle, in the case of an accident or damage from natural disasters. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-463932" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/EcoCash.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/EcoCash.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/EcoCash-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gilbert Tsongorera, the commercial director for EcoCash Holdings Zimbabwe Limited, Moovah’s parent company, said while third party insurance is often the cheaper option, comprehensive insurance covers motorists for a far wider range of risks. “Third party insurance covers you for damage to other people’s vehicles, should you become involved in an accident and are deemed at fault. Comprehensive insurance not only covers you for the damage to other people’s vehicles — but it also covers your own vehicle as well. “If your vehicle is stolen or damaged in an accident, even if it’s the driver’s fault, comprehensive cover has your back,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614230" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/moover.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/moover.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/moover-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “It’s a good idea to think about how you’d fare if you suddenly found yourself without a car. Would you be able to get to work without it? Would you be able to afford to buy a new car straight away? If either answer is no, our comprehensive cover is the best fit for you.” Moovah’s comprehensive vehicle insurance covers the car up to the insured or market value. “It also covers your car if it is damaged from an accident, by hail, storms, falling trees or other acts of nature. If your car is caught in severe weather, you won’t have to stress about it. <img class="size-full wp-image-614224" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/54.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/54.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/54-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Damaged vehicles.

Mr Tsongorera noted that the damaged vehicle will be towed to the nearest garage or safe place. “If you bought a brand new car within the past couple of years, Moovah can offer you a new-for-old replacement if your car is a total writeoff. This makes comprehensive cover a smart option as our customers can be back on the road with a new car in no time,” he said.  In addition to comprehensive and third-party insurance cover, Moovah also offers full third party Fire and Theft cover. Full third party fire and theft insurance covers damage or loss caused by fire or theft or attempted theft to the insured vehicle or its accessories over and above the third party liabilities, should the owner be at fault.
