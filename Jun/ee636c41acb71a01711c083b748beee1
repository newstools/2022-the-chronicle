The late South African reggae legend Lucky Dube’s song Together As One last two verses: “The cats and the dogs have forgiven each other, what is wrong with us? <img class="wp-image-621145 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-18-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-18-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-18-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lucky Dube All those years fighting each other but no solution,” could have been directed at the challenges brought about by the apartheid in South Africa, but the same message fits “warring” former Ndolwane Super Sounds vocalists Charles “Mdolomba KaZwane” Ndebele and Martin “The Big Boss” Sibanda. It is now 11 years since the two split and despite pleas from fans for them to come together, even if it is to record just a single or an album, those pleas have not warmed their hearts. Many are still trying to find out what unpardonable sin each committed to the other to break the childhood brotherhood. The original Ndolwane had 14 albums and the duo worked together and churned out hit after hit from the first album, Africa until the split in 2011. It is undeniable that the death of one of the group founders, rhythmist Abson “Bhule” Ndebele was the beginning of the fall of the group as he seemed to have been a good bridge between the two. But 11 years later, they are miles apart. Even a mini-show they put on when they joined each other on stage on a few occasions has not helped. Two weeks ago, Ndebele had a show at Hilbrow Theatre in South Africa which Sibanda attended and when the former learnt that his former “partner” was in the house, he invited him on stage and they reunited for some songs. <img class="alignnone wp-image-621148 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-20-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-20-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-20-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Soon after that, fans on social media began calling for the two to come together. They felt that despite their fights, the two artistes’ voices were meant for each other as when they back each other vocally, they bring their best game. Sibanda accepted the offer to collaborate for an album although putting money upfront, but Ndebele sang a different tune when reached for comment. The Amangwe Production leader vowed never to do an album with his former partner, not even for any amount. In what revealed how far apart the two are, Ndebele told this reporter that he will never do any song with The Big Boss accusing his camp of “insulting and undermining me a lot”. “I’m not in a position to do that (the album). These people have, many times, made a fool out of my name and have never apologised. All of a sudden because they’re at a dead-end, they now see it fit to do something with me. Why today? Recently, they used Obert Vundla (former Ndolwane Super Sounds bassist) to say bad things about me and when fans came baying for his blood, he said sorry, but there’s no sorry after death. “Prior to this, Sibanda told people that he’ll never do an album with me and those who want to listen to our voices can listen to the many songs that we recorded long back. So why today? Because they know I’m busy working on my album, they’re coming up with something that’ll disturb my album. I’m not interested! “I’ll never ever do any song with Martin as long as I live. Only if they come out openly and apologise for soiling my name,” he said. Ndebele went on and accused Sibanda’s camp of sending people to insult him on social media and making up negative stories about him. The Azibuye Emasisweni composer said in an orchestrated move, he was even blocked from using his Facebook account after being wrongly reported that he uses vulgar as a way of muzzling him from responding to their insults. “If I was important, why did they send people to insult me? They have made me appear stupid and someone who is incapable of doing anything. They want to use me to uplift another man’s name because they think I’m stupid. That will never happen, engachitheka achithekile. I’m not in a state to do this and no matter how much money is put in, I’ll never do it. My pride comes first. I’m a man and my pride has to be respected. I’ll never do it,” reiterated Ndebele. Fans dreaming of the two together should probably just accept the fact that the days of a united Ndolwane Super Sounds died 11 years ago. Responding to the fans’ pressure for the two to record an album together, The Big Boss, however, seemed to have warmed up to the idea if posts on his Facebook page are anything to go by. <img class="alignnone wp-image-621154 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Even his latest album Uzovuma has a track dedicated to Abson where his memories for the unifier are evident. “It is in your power to make the album possible. I have 50 000 followers on Facebook and if each contributes R50, it will cover all the expenses and make the album a success. It is also an opportune time for sponsors and businessmen to come forward and use Ndolwane Super Sounds as your brand ambassadors, you can finalise that with my management. “There are those who are questioning why I am demanding money upfront, music is business and there is no business that does not need money. I have accepted your challenge (to work on an album with Ndebele) you can do the rest,” wrote Sibanda. His manager Lucky Moyo later confirmed that he was indeed trying to reach Ndebele’s camp and was waiting for a response on their position. The split has also divided followers creating a rivalry that is openly displayed on social media as debates can be heated when their names are discussed.  The cats and dogs have forgiven each other, what is wrong with Martin and Charles Ndebele? All those years fighting each other, but no solution? The two could as well be perfect guests for a Forgive and Forget TV series. Maybe then, they will work together. – @themkhust
