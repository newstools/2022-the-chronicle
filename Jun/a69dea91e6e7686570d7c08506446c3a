PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday sounded the death knell on armed robbers and ritual murderers, calling on law enforcement agents to decisively deal with the violent criminals. Speaking at the burial of the late National Hero, Major-General Godfrey Chanakira, who led a life of honesty, hard-work and discipline, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabweans should take a leaf from such exemplary leaders. <img class="size-full wp-image-613417" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/gwer.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/gwer.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/gwer-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Retired Major General Godfrey Chanakira Maj-Gen Chanakira, whose Chimurenga nom de guerre was Cde Garikayi Musavengana, died on May 26 at West End Hospital in Harare from a heart ailment. “I am, however, concerned about the rising cases of armed robberies and ritual murders occurring in our country. I, thus, exhort stakeholders in the criminal justice system to speedily deal with these emerging negative trends. Equally worrisome are road traffic accidents on our major highways. I call upon drivers to always exercise extreme caution,” said President Mnangagwa.  The country has of late experienced violent crimes where innocent lives have been lost in ritual murders that often target women and children. Armed robberies are also on the rise, with suspects using guns and other weapons to seize huge amounts of cash from businesses and individuals. Outlining the elaborate life of Maj-Gen Chanakira from his early age, political life, his service in the army and as a civil servant, up until his demise, President Mnangagwa described the national hero as a loyal and honest person. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614308" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/sdfgdg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/sdfgdg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/sdfgdg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The late national hero Major-General Chanakira will be fondly remembered for his humility, discipline, hard-honest work and commitment to duty. These cardinal virtues must be emulated by both those in the Public Service and our country’s security establishments,” said President Mnangagwa. “As we lay to rest the late national hero, Major-General Godfrey Chanakira, at this sacred shrine, let us re-commit ourselves as a nation to the defence and preservation of our revolution, independence, freedom and democracy. The flames of unity, peace, non-violence, love and respect must continue to be at the centre of our interactions at every level and across communities.” He implored Zimbabweans to continue focusing on achieving national objectives aimed at improving the country’s economic prospects. “Fellow mourners, comrades and friends; let us continue to shoulder the responsibility to develop, modernise and industrialise our country. The development philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’ is instructive and must embolden us never to tire in building our roads, dams, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure as well as in producing what we eat and manufacturing our own clothes and what we use,” said President Mnangagwa. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614307" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/rttg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/rttg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/rttg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He noted that during the course of the week, the country also lost four distinguished comrades namely, Cde Francis Komboni Gondo, Cde Charles Savanhu, Cde Christopher Kuruneri and Cde Leonard Chikomba. “These comrades have been granted provincial hero status. In addition, we have also lost Chief Denis Ndlovu Nhlamba of Gwanda who passed on at the United Bulawayo Hospitals on May 28 2022. Earlier, we had lost Chief Vusumuzi Khumalo Mabhikwa of Lupane, on May 23 2022. May the souls of these departed comrades rest in peace,” said President Mnangagwa. He said the nation acknowledges the supreme sacrifices of liberation fighters and the Second Republic will continue looking after the welfare of the veterans of the liberation struggle. President Mnangagwa described the passing on of Maj-Gen Chanakira as sudden, adding that the country was still to come to terms with the fact that he was no longer there. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614311" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/funeral.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/funeral.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/funeral-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “On behalf of the revolutionary party, Zanu-PF, the Government and indeed on my own behalf, I express my sincere condolences to the Chanakira family, to his wife and children, for the loss of a beloved husband and father. May you draw comfort from the knowledge that the whole nation shares and endures in the sad loss and grief for the late national hero, Major-General Chanakira, who was no longer yours alone, but ours together,” he said. Maj-Gen Chanakira was born on May 24 1957.
