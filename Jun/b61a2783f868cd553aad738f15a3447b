However, the last quarter of the year was affected by the shortages of glass bottles for ciders resulting in product shortages, especially the Hunters brand. The wine category was adversely affected by limited trading in the on-premise consumption channel during hard lockdowns. The group hoped the business would benefit from the expansion of sales channels and the local production of some of its key product lines. “To address market supply-demand, the group said a new packaging plant is scheduled for installation in early 2023.
