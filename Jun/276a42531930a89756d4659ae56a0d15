ZIMBABWE recorded a 47,9 percent decrease in malaria cases in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, as the country gears up to meet Global Malaria Strategy 2030 targets which include eliminating the killer disease in high burden countries. The cases dropped from 28 941 to 19 496. The Ministry of Health and Child Care says even malaria deaths decreased during the period.  Manicaland province led with 5 891, Mashonaland Central 5824, Mashonaland East 3941, Masvingo 2323 and Mashonaland West 734. Matabeleland North 369, Matabeleland South 203, Midlands 138, Harare 57 and Bulawayo 16. Part of 2030 targets are to reduce malaria case incidence by at least 90 percent, reduce malaria mortality rate by at least 90 percent and to prevent a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free. The Ministry’s Malaria Department, Social Behavior Change Communications Officer, Mrs Fortunate Manjoro urged the public to be aware of the signs and symptoms so that they can seek treatment. <img class="wp-image-613723 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-25.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-25.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-25-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Headache “A reduction of 47,9 percent of malaria cases was noted in the first week of 2022 second quarter as compared to the same period in 2021 with malaria deaths over the same period going down from 48 the previous year to 26 in 2022. “The Ministry is conducting house spraying in all the 10 provinces of Zimbabwe as well as providing protective bed nets to places with outbreaks as a way to curb malaria and meet the Global Malaria Strategy 2030, said Mrs Manjoro. She said malaria signs and symptoms include fever, headache, general body pains, hot and cold spells, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. “Anyone experiencing these signs and symptoms should go for testing for malaria. Delays in seeking treatment for malaria leads to severe disease which may lead to death,” said Mrs Manjoro. <img class="alignnone wp-image-613720 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-28-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-28-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-28-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pregnant women in high to moderate malaria transmission areas, she said, were urged to book early and receive tablets to prevent malaria monthly, until they deliver. Although malaria cases are on the decrease, the Ministry noted that Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East and Manicaland provinces are recording the highest cases accounting for 77 percent of the total (3 066) cases recorded so far in April 2022.
