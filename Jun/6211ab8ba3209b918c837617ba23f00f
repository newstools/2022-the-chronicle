THERE is a bus in Bulawayo that has taken the city by storm. This is not your ordinary bus as it is one specifically for those who want to have a good time. Unlike conventional buses that have specific routes, this one takes you wherever you want to go, no matter the time. “Whatever your mission is, we make it possible!” is the motto of this 15-seater Black Ball Party Bus. <img class="wp-image-621073 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-10-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inside the Party Bus Music and flashing lights greet passengers as they board the bus. Instantly, one feels like taking out their smartphone to take videos and pictures of the rare experience. Behind this concept are two brothers from Pumula Old, Thembani and Sipho Ngwenya who have a penchant for creative DIY. The two are founders of a company called Black Ball Supplies that has been providing entertainment accessories like pool tables and sound systems. It has now upped its game by entering the entertainment industry as a service provider. After 10 years of trying to turn an idea into a reality, they have finally gotten off the ground and launched two party buses in their hometown Bulawayo. The party bus is being branded as a mobile entertainment lounge, a place to experience good music, a drink or two, and even braai, all the while socialising with friends. <img class="wp-image-621091 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-12-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-12-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-12-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> music “We came up with this concept after realising that people generally like to drive around, drink and party. The Black Box Party Bus is available for group rentals or private parties providing an immersive party bus experience where clients can enjoy themselves as they ride around Bulawayo or anywhere else in the country,” said Thembani Ngwenya, chief operations officer for Black Box Supplies. The creators of the Black Box Party Bus claim the bus helps solve two problems: people’s insatiable appetite for galivanting and the not having to drive under the influence. “We’ve driven kombis before. People drink and consume alcohol in kombis so we decided, why not provide a similar, but a safer experience for them.” He said the bus goes to all parts of Zimbabwe. “We go all over Zimbabwe, but obviously, it also depends on the quality of roads. We, however, have no limits in Zimbabwe and we’re also willing to go across the border, we don’t mind,” he added. “Those who board the bus, Ngwenya said will truly enjoy an excellent night or day out cruising as they have adapted their vehicle into a high-class party bus “that will become truly synonymous with fun and the best time. “The sound in the buses is out of this world and we made sure that the seats are as comfortable as possible. Our floors are stiffened and soft. Even when you are shoeless, you are comfortable. Our windows are tinted for privacy. There’s a braai stand and fridge on board. We make sure that we treat our clients like VIPs so we do all the labour like braaing and stuff. And this is what makes us very special,” Ngwenya said. To ensure that they are visible, they recently branded their buses. “We love being seen across Bulawayo, where our branded buses will be visible by thousands of people throughout the region and beyond.” Ngwenya and his brother, Sipho realised that customers have many choices and their company wants to ensure quality customer service. “Ultimate satisfaction must be the first and only priority and that’s why we’re working on customising the second member of our fleet. And as our business grows, we hope to partner with concert venues and events to provide transportation for artistes and their entourages.” He said he envisions expanding the concept to other cities as time progresses and funding improves. A lifetime of innovation, designs and creations between the brothers has now seen them go into the party bus business together. And it’s been 10 years of dreaming and trying and dreaming some more! As kids, the former kombi drivers loved to work with their hands. They made wire cars and used to steal bulbs at home just to add headlights to their wire cars. <img class="wp-image-621079 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-11-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-11-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-11-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Christmas lights Christmas lights were also game for these two “MacGyvers” — as they were used to make tail lights! And, to boot, the two miscreants of their day even went as far as booby-trapping their front gate — to stop criminals from entering their yard! “We’ve always been trying to modify things. This is a part of who we are. We’ve booby-trapped our gate to trap thieves. We grew up with this sort of innovation,” laughs Thembani. “It took us 10 years to plan and get this business off the ground. We tried to get people with buses to work with us, but they failed to see our vision. I even tried when I worked in South Africa when I started Thembani Transfer Travel, but I didn’t have proper documentation so I lost everything and had to go back to square one,” Ngwenya revealed. “My brother and I returned to Zimbabwe and it was back to driving kombis where again, we tried to get people to work with us, but unfortunately, many didn’t understand the concept and it was hard to convince them. In the end, all I did was customise my employer’s kombi which enabled me to get more customers. My brother left the country and this is how we managed to raise the needed funds to begin bringing our dream to life. “We started this project in 2018 after Sipho bought two buses and we began working on customising them ourselves. I worked with my two sons, Wesley and Romeo and their cousin Fanaza and the four of us made it into what it is today. “So, it’s been a long journey for two boys from Pumula Old, Emadonkini who’re about to service the whole country.”  Key to the success of the business is their insistence on hiring an experienced and sober driver with more than 10 years of driving experience for the bus that boasts a TV set, some serious sound, a braai stand, and a mini-fridge. “Our drivers are not allowed to drink which is why we closed off and separated the drivers from the partiers. It’s our responsibility to keep our clients safe and we don’t want people to party and fall on the drivers. We just left a small window for communication,” Ngwenya said. – @RealSimbaJemwa
