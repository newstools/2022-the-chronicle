He was an epitome of wisdom within the family. He spent most of his life serving the country,” said Col Nyathi. He also described the late Maj Gen (Rtd) Nyathi as a fountain of wisdom. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617031" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/burial-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/burial-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/burial-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Col Nyathi commended President Mnangagwa and the entire Zanu-PF leadership for conferring him with national hero status. His teacher at Manama Mission, Cde Obert Matshalaga, said Maj-Gen (Rtd) Nyathi was an intelligent student. “He was the best brains then. To be recognised during the Rhodesian era showed that he was a genius. “I was his teacher at Manama High School. He was a very intelligent boy and from there one could tell that he was destined for greater heights. He was a fighter, an unwavering cadre of the liberation struggle,” said Cde Matshalaga. One of his close friends, Col Temizulu Ncube, said the late national hero was a dedicated cadre who served his country diligently. “I met the late national hero at school in Gwanda South. We were very close growing up. He was from a big family and we are in a way related. He did well for the family and the country as a whole. We left the country to join the liberation struggle and we met after Independence. He remained a soft spoken individual,” said Col Ncube. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617034" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/burial-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/burial-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/burial-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said the late veteran of the liberation struggle was a survivor of Freedom Camp bombing by the racist Ian Smith government. “He was a survivor. He also served in a number of units in the Zimbabwe National Army. His death has left the country poorer. He was very humble and unassuming,” said Col Ncube. Another contemporary of his, Brigadier General Mpulaeng Siziba, said although they were at different schools, it was clear the late Maj Gen (Rtd) was an intelligent person. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617049" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Sikhulile-Simpson-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Sikhulile-Simpson-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Sikhulile-Simpson-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We grew up in the same area, though we went to different schools. As we interacted you could tell that he was an intelligent person. We later met at military training. He was my senior but he was a humble man whose intelligence was unmatched,” said Brig Gen Siziba. Zanu-PF Matabeleland South provincial chairman Cde Mangaliso Ndlovu said youths should learn from the good works of the late national hero. “We are really happy as a province with the status accorded to the late national hero. He put our province on the map. We are celebrating a life lived by a cadre. A life lived by a true hero. As children of Matabeleland South, we will continue to follow his footsteps. We will continue to encourage young people to remain patriotic. They should put their country first regardless of what is happening. This is our country, our only country,” said Cde Ndlovu. <img class="size-full wp-image-596960" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mangaliso-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mangaliso-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mangaliso-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF Matabeleland South provincial chairman Cde Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu An executive member of Young Women for ED, Ms Apphia Musavengana, said youths should always put their country first in w “This is a very sad moment for us, to lose our history tellers.
