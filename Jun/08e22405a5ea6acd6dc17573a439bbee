I haven’t been able to celebrate its success with fans so I’m looking forward to the event as this has been long overdue. “Actually, the title track’s declaration won’t be fully complete without giving it this respect. <img class="wp-image-620566 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-383.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-383.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-383-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> God Almighty The Wavuma Experience is not only a concert but a time to give glory back to God Almighty,” said Pastor Barak.
