He said he knew him from the days of the liberation struggle. “We worked together; we were together even at the Assembly Point in Gwayi for demobilisation. But operationally, we did not get deployed together. He was very courageous and always devoted to his duties even during the war of liberation. We were integrated differently to the ZNA as he moved to Infantry while I was diverted to Engineering. But as we rose through the ranks our paths crossed again as we worked together at Army Headquarters,” he said.

He said they were part of a group of students who skipped the country to join the liberation struggle with the likes of the late national hero and former Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Dr Sibusiso Moyo. “We were together at Manama High School and we crossed together and we also trained together but thereafter we got separated. We then met after independence as he joined the military and I joined the President’s Department. He was my friend and I treated him like a brother. We would communicate frequently,” said Cde Nguluvhe. “He was very intelligent and he proved himself a lot in the ZNA. He is one of first crop to be promoted to senior ranks together with the likes of the late SB Moyo, Lieutenant-General (Rtd) Engelbert Rugeje among others. He was an integral person in the ZNA. He was even an instructor at the Zimbabwe Defence College. His loss is not just to his family but to the nation because he made a lot of contributions to the liberation of this country.” Mourners are gathered at Number 6, 21st Avenue, Mabelreign in Harare. Burial arrangements will be announced in due course. – @nqotshili
