POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested a 50-year-old man from Sizinda who was found in possession of copper cables whose value is yet to be established. Lungani Mpofu ran out of luck when his neighbours tipped off police that his twin cab vehicle with a South African registration number was full of stolen copper cables. Detectives acted on the information and laid an ambush for Mpofu. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube confirmed the incident saying Mpofu is set to appear in court soon.
He said police recovered six big and 19 small bundles of copper wire from Mpofu. <img class="size-full wp-image-610744" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Inspectors-Abednico-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Inspectors-Abednico-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Inspectors-Abednico-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube “We have arrested Lungani Mpofu 50 who was spotted in Sizinda driving a Twin Cab GP full of copper cables which he indicated should be disposed of out of Zimbabwe. Some of his neighbours got wind of that information and notified police,” said Insp Ncube. “A team of detectives proceeded to Sizinda township and led an ambush along a bushy area near his home. After a few minutes he appeared driving the same motor vehicle which he stopped outside his gate. Some of the detectives approached him and when he became suspicious, Mpofu tried to reverse quickly but was eventually blocked and arrested.” Insp Ncube said detectives also recovered some copper cables inside Mpofu’s bedroom. He commended members of the public for partnering with police to curb crime. “We acknowledge the efforts by residents and it will go a long way in improving our economy as we know that copper cable theft is affecting us in a great way. We also encourage them to stop stealing these cables as effects will eventually cripple the economy. <img class="size-full wp-image-609523" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/COPPER.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/COPPER.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/COPPER-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Copper cables This comes at a time when the Cabinet has just approved the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2022. The Bill introduces stiffer penalties for the abstraction or diversion of electricity, or the use of such electricity knowing that it was illegally abstracted or diverted. It will also remove the option of a fine where one is convicted of the crime. Furthermore, the Bill introduces stiffer penalties for the transportation of material used in connection with the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity without the option of a fine.  Zesa is suffering huge losses due to theft and vandalism of the national electricity infrastructure. In 2021, Zesa recorded 1 237 cases of theft and vandalism, resulting in huge losses of revenue, which could have been used for development. The Amendment Bill will deter would-be offenders through stiffer and mandatory sentences. — @thamamoe
