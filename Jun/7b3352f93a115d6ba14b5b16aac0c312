WARRIORS and Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba has pledged to build a new classroom block at his former school, Dinde Primary School in Hwange, during a visit yesterday. The work will be done through the Marvelous Nakamba Foundation (MNF), and will also include upping the number of scholarship beneficiaries he pays for. He is currently paying fees for 1 000 learners countrywide. Two hundred learners will be provided with a full uniform set and school shoes. The foundation also promised to renovate teachers’ cottages at the school where he did his Grade Two to Grade Four before moving to Bulawayo. <img class="wp-image-606490 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-88.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-88.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-88-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> From Dinde Primary, Nakamba visited Sir Humphrey Gibbs Primary School where he did Grade One and pledged fees and uniforms to disadvantaged learners.

One of the biggest thrusts of the foundation is to give back to the community by the founder and benefactor and true to that, the foundation is living its dream. We will continue to affect our communities positively,” said Moyo. Dinde Primary headmistress Sithabile Viki said: “It’s good news to hear that our classrooms are going to be fixed, while the new block will be of huge benefit for us. Most learners here come barefooted so with this help we will receive from the foundation, learning is going to be comfortable for our learners.”  Formed in 2019, the foundation has also started work towards building a multi-discipline sports complex in Mahatshula suburb in Bulawayo. The complex is set to house sporting facilities for tennis, basketball, volleyball, swimming and football. – @innocentskizoe.
