The Chronicle She has a lot to be grateful for. Last week alone, she received 16 plaques for her music which reached gold and platinum status. Her biggest win was her album African Queen which went gold and her record label, Open Mic Productions hosted a massive celebration at Orthodox Lounge in Johannesburg, to congratulate her on the wins. She is also beaming with joy to have made it to the list of nominees for the South African Music Awards (Samas). Last year, she felt side-lined by the Samas when she was not nominated. Singer and songwriter Makhadzi, real name Ndivhudzannyi Ralivhona (25), expressed her frustration on social media about how gutted she was after having worked hard on her album Kokovha and her hard work not being recognised. <img class="wp-image-617410 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-35-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-35-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-35-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> South African Music Awards “So sad for not being recognised after what Matorokisi did for Africa last year. To all my fans, I submitted everything. Your love and support matter. I will keep working hard until the day they recognise me.” <img class="wp-image-617413 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-36-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-36-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-36-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prince Benza This year, she is smiling from ear to ear as she is nominated three times for Best Collaboration for the song Zwivhuya featuring Joe Delinger, Music video of the Year for Ghanama featuring Prince Benza, and Artist of The Year category. “I am so excited to be nominated. I know my supporters will vote for me,” she told Drum. “I have my eye on the Artist of the Year category, but you never know because it all depends on the votes, and I am up against great artistes who have also worked hard.” The good news could not have come at a better time for the singer as she had been lying low after a traumatic robbery that took place at Ga-Rankuwa Shisanyama in Tshwane. A gun was pointed at her head before her performance, while she was at the venue’s parking lot.  Makhadzi’s management has since beefed up her security and she is now focusing on her music and crossing fingers she will walk away with at least one award. “The nominations have cheered me up from the incident. It hasn’t been easy, but I am doing much better.” — Drum
