BULAWAYO’S Mpopoma High School is appealing to well-wishers for help to buy furniture for learners and teachers following a donation by former pupils called the Titanians. Founded in 1959, the school has an enrolment of 2 292 pupils, but most of its property is old and damaged.
Speaking during the donation of 40 chairs and desks yesterday by the former pupils, the school head Mr Christopher Dube said they are in need of chairs, desks, laboratory stools, additional toilets and furniture for the staff room.
He said the school continues to groom future professionals in the country but due to the high enrolment they need help. <img class="wp-image-614244 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-74.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-74.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-74-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> chairs “We are proud of how far we have come as a school and we currently have 2 292 learners hence the need for furniture since ours is old and has been damaged. We endeavour to continue producing focused and hard-working individuals from our school who will become leaders in all facets,” he said. The leader of the Titanians, Mrs Mildred Ngwenya said the group was formed after a number of former learners realised they could give back to the school that nurtured them. “We remember during the old days how we would enjoy learning in this school with access to everything, but enrolment was not as high. We then decided to form a group which currently has 25 members and we are here to give back,” said Mrs Ngwenya. “This is a humble beginning; it reflects the love we have for our school and we hope that it will motivate other former learners to contribute to the development of this precious school. We managed to buy 40 chairs and 40 desks so that at least a few of the learners can have access to proper furniture.” Mrs Ngwenya urged other well-wishers to join the group and donate the needed materials so that the school is able to provide quality education to its learners. <img class="wp-image-614245 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-75.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-75.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-75-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Laboratory stools One of the members is Mr Joe Kahwema who owns a local hotel. He encouraged learners to continue raising the Mpopoma High flag. “Our wish is to see more learners from this school succeed and become influential professionals and businessmen in this country. We encourage pupils to take their studies seriously and not be deterred by any factor because we too passed through these challenges, but managed to soar high and become successful. “No challenge can come in the way of their success as long as they work hard and we know they have so many opportunities in this country despite everything that we are going through,” said Mr Kawema. <img class="wp-image-614253 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-77.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-77.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-77-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mpopoma High The School Development Committee chairperson Alderman Phineas Ndlovu said although parents were cooperative in paying school fees, inflation made it difficult for the school to buy furniture. “We are grateful to supportive parents who have not disappointed in terms of paying fees and supporting every development at this school. Our major enemy is inflation because the resources we had only enabled us to buy 25 chairs. This is only a drop in the ocean considering the needs of this school,” he said. “This school was built for fewer pupils long back but now that we have so many learners, we need additional toilets which can be used by staff members. Our teachers also need furniture as what they are using now strips them of the dignity they deserve.” – @thamamoe
