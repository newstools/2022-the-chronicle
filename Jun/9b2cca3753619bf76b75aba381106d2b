Chief Shana who represents Hwange in the Chief’s Council said the whole district was shocked by the accident which came hardly two weeks after the death of Chief Mabhikwa of Lupane who died in a car accident along the same road – Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway. “We are worried because we were still mourning Chief Mabhikwa who died in a car accident last week and now we have our colleague in critical condition. He has been transferred to Mater Dei in Bulawayo and we are waiting for update. All we can do is pray he heals faster,” said Chief Shana. Chief Nekatambe’s neighbour Chief Dingane-Nelukoba said the community was concerned about the chief’s condition. Police confirmed the accident which occurred at around 5pm near the Vehicle Inspection Department Hwange depot. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Glory Banda said the chief fractured his right thigh and upper right arm, and also complained of chest pains after the accident. <img class="wp-image-615195 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-31-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-31-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-31-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Glory Banda He said the accident occurred when the driver of a tipper truck Mr Donald Tembo (35) failed to stop at a stop sign at the junction of Independence Road and Bulawayo-Hwange Highway resulting in the collision with Chief Nekatambe who was driving towards Hwange town. “The first party (Mr Tembo) was driving a tipper truck and intending to turn right but failed to give way resulting in a collision with the second party (Chief Nekatambe) who was driving an Isuzu double cab,” said Insp Banda. He said the chief lost control of the vehicle which veered of the road and landed in a ditch. He sustained a deep cut on the head, a fracture on the upper arm, and also on the right thigh. Witnesses reportedly struggled to pull Chief Nekatambe from the vehicle where he was trapped until the fire brigade arrived and used cutting torches to rip open the vehicle and pull him out. He was rushed to Hwange Colliery Hospital before being transferred to Bulawayo.  Insp Banda urged motorists to observe extreme caution. “We want to advise the motoring public to exercise extreme caution when driving along the country’s roads for safety. Motorists should also abide by road rules to prevent carnage. Those carrying heavy loads should also check if their loads are secure before travelling so as to avoid endangering other road users,” said Insp Banda. – @ncubeleon
