WHILE many people wince at the thought of doing laundry, a chore considered to be cumbersome, two enterprising women from Bulawayo’s affluent Malindela suburb have monetised the task to make ends meet. Miss Gugulethu Banda and her business partner Miss Pamela Ndebele, who were weary of the hustle and bustle of being employed decided to start their own company, Fresh and Clean. After researching and trying to find possible business ventures, the two ladies decided on laundry, a job they knew many people barely have time for and is also a task that many would rather not tackle. The laundromat Fresh and Clean was established in 2020, when the pair only had as little as five clients. However, according to Miss Banda, their fortunes turned around after they began extensively marketing their company on various social media platforms. “We had grown tired of working for other people. The thought of enriching somebody else at my expense was just energy consuming and I said enough is enough,” said Miss Banda. She said despite her thoughts she was still employed elsewhere but the idea of starting her own company was fast-tracked by the Covid-19-induced lockdown. <img class="wp-image-596024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 “It was during the Covid-19 lockdown that many people lost their jobs while some had to work from home. For some of us who worked for indigenous companies, we had to make ends meet as most places shut down. This was when we decided to implement our plans to run our own company,” said Miss Banda. She said when they started, the laundry was done manually as they had no washing machine. “The loads at the beginning were not as much so it was manageable. It was when our client base grew that we realised that we had great potential and at the same time could lose our clients. “During the early days we could get up to about two or three bags. Once we met our target after three months, we bought our first washing machine and dryer,” said Miss Banda. <img class="wp-image-616756 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> washing machine She said they later bought more washing machines in response to the growing business. Miss Banda said they operate every day of the week. “We operate every day of the week and as such we don’t have off days. We still want to grow and become a reputable laundry service just like Matebele Steam Laundry,” said Miss Banda. She said at the moment they do not do pick-ups or deliveries but plans were underway to buy a vehicle to provide such services. Miss Banda said they were improving the services each passing day as they addressed shortcomings. She said during their early days they had a challenge of mixing up people’s clothes. “I now mark the loads with the clients’ names. It was in the early stages that I got peoples’ clothes mixed up but it wasn’t much of a big deal. When it did happen, I had to review garment by garment, size by size, to figure out what belonged to each client. I contacted the people that had picked up their clothes on the day. I let both clients know so that they were aware of the inconvenience. At the end we were able to solve it and we delivered everything in order,” said Miss Banda. She said they charge loads differently and according to what is being washed. “We charge $6 for washing and folding, $10 wash and iron (per basket).  We wash anything from blankets, carpets, sneakers, blazers, curtains, linen and of course clothes. Normally it is just Pamela and I, but we get assistance from our good friend Petty Madonko,” said Miss Banda. She said for those interested in doing a business of such a nature, they had to possess good business ethics and qualities. “You have to know the nature of the business, have a proper attitude, know how to manage people and always know that you have to satisfy clients,” said Miss Banda. — @peterkmatika
