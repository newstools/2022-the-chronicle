THE on-going civil works to modernise the Beitbridge Border Post will enhance critical skills transfer for at least 1 600 Zimbabweans in addition to upgrading the physical infrastructure, an official has said. The Government in conjunction with the Zimborders Consortium is carrying out the border transformation works at a cost of US$300 million. This is being done under a 17 and half-year concession between the two parties. In an interview the consortium’s general manager, Mr Nqobile Ncube, said they have employed more than 1 600 Zimbabweans to work on the project. He said the Beitbridge community will also benefit from the key infrastructure including a fire station, a sewer oxidation dam and improvement of water supply infrastructure that falls under the out-of-port works. <img class="alignnone wp-image-617259 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/bbridge-fire-station.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/bbridge-fire-station.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/bbridge-fire-station-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “There is an aspect of community beneficiation to this project as we have created 1 600 jobs,” said Mr Ncube. He said the engagement of locals does not only bring remuneration to the employees but also skills transfers. Mr Ncube said by the time the project is completed, a number of locals would have been empowered through skills transfer. He said more locals will be engaged permanently at the three border terminals, with 62 already having been hired to manage the bus terminal. <img class="wp-image-617335 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-23-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A sewer oxidation dam The project is being rolled out in three phases and Phase One was the construction of freight terminal, installation of ICT facilities and construction of roads while phase Two was the construction of the buses and light vehicles terminal as well as the offsite works including the upgrading of water and sanitation facilities in the border town.
