CHICKEN Inn’s prodigal striker Clive Augusto has started training with his new teammates and coach Joey Antipas is pleased to have the bustling forward back in the fold. <img class="wp-image-601939 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chicken-Inn-coach-Joey-Antipas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chicken-Inn-coach-Joey-Antipas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chicken-Inn-coach-Joey-Antipas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas Augusto rejoined the Gamecocks on a free transfer after being unceremoniously released by Caps United along with five teammates for allegedly leading a player mutiny which almost caused the postponement of their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against Cranborne Bullets. The 27-year-old striker was fired together with Devon Chafa, Denis Dauda, Simbarashe Chinani, Rodwell Chinyengetere and Ronald Chitiyo. <img class="wp-image-615370 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-22-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ronald Chitiyo However, the trio of Chitiyo, Chinyengetere and Chafa were pardoned by the Caps United leadership. Chitiyo, however, left the Green Machine and joined Northern Region Division One side Simba Bhora. Augusto reportedly penned a two-year contract with the Gamecocks. “It is good to have Clive back. His arrival is a major boost to the team. He has to concentrate and stay focused.  He showed some brilliant touches, but he needs to up his fitness levels,” said Antipas. Initial reports had suggested that Augusto was set to cross the divide to Dynamos, but Chicken Inn were more appealing to the 2019 Premier Soccer League Soccer Star finalist and Golden Boot Award winner. — @FungaiMuderere
