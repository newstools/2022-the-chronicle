MATABELELAND South Province is set to benefit from a US$13,8 million project which seeks to create resilience within communities through food and nutrition security and improved access to water and sanitation services. Government working in partnership with the European Union has rolled out the Enhanced Resilience for Vulnerable Households in Zimbabwe (ERVHIZ) programme in six districts in Matabeleland South Province. The programme seeks to enhance nutrition, enhance early warning systems and ensure health through provision of clean water, sanitation and hygiene. ERVHIZ is funded by EU through Unicef and FAO which are the implementing partners. <img class="size-full wp-image-613407" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Unicef The project has three components namely Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), agriculture and food and nutrition security. It will ensure that communities have improved access to clean water, ablution facilities, better knowledge on how to improve their yields and improved access to information on weather forecast among other issues. The programme which will run for three years started in January with the agriculture component now being implemented. Speaking during a Provincial Water and Sanitation Committee meeting in Gwanda recently DDF Matabeleland South provincial coordinator, Mr Moment Malandu, said the WASH component of the project was yet to commence. He said the target was to ensure that 117 250 families have improved assess to WASH services. “ERVHIZ is an integrated project which seeks to create resilience in individuals and communities. The programme which is funded by EU through Unicef and FAO seeks to support Government efforts of creating resilience within communities. The progarmme is being implemented in Bulilima, Beitbridge, Gwanda, Insiza, Mangwe and Matobo Districts. Although the agriculture component has commenced, the WASH and nutrition components are yet to be implemented as we are at planning stage,” he said.  “The project seeks to contribute to the well being of households in vulnerable situations in the face of economic and climate induced shocks and stresses. Communities will have improved access to WASH services, they will be protected against severe food insecurity and farmers will record improved production.” He said nine piped water schemes will be installed under the project, 33 new boreholes will be drilled and 337 rehabilitated.
Mr Malandu said 900 water points will be tested for quality and different structures under WASH from village level to district level will received training. Also speaking during the meeting Matabeleland South acting provincial agricultural director rural development services Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu said the project seeks to promote good agricultural practices that will promote resilience among communities. He said it seeks to equip farmers with crop harvesting techniques, improved animal husbandry skills, pasture management skills and promote establishment of nutrition gardens. <img class="size-full wp-image-614280" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/utatoirs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/utatoirs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/utatoirs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland South provincial agricultural officer Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu (left) Mr Ndlovu said they were already equipping farmers with knowledge on improved post harvest management practices and improved agro-ecological dry land farming for both crops and livestock. “Under the programme we have trained a number of farmers as well as extension workers. The trainings are on post harvest and fodder production, preservation and feeding. Farmers have also been trained on best practices on agroecological dry land crop production such as crop nutrition enhancement technologies such as thermal composting and vermi-composting,” he said. “Farmers were trained to appreciate all types of organic fertiliser making processes. Farmers have also started adopting organic fertiliser production as well as water harvesting and conservation techniques such as potholing and mulching.” — @DubeMatutu
