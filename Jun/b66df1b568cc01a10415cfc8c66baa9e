When we worked together at the International Bible Society of Zimbabwe he was one of first to be called by Pius Wakatamwa to translate it. He had deep knowledge of the isiNdebele language and he was the person we looked up to during the process of translating,” Mrs Nkala said. She said Mr Mpofu has left a legacy for generations to come.
