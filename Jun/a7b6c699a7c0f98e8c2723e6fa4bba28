STATE-OWNED mobile telecommunications service provider, NetOne, has introduced ‘Hurudza/Umlimi Omkhulu’ initiative, a new agricultural platform that allows farmers to subscribe and get access to diverse information in the farming ecosystem. In a statement, NetOne said the Hurudza/Umlimi Omkhulu platform is there to address a number of farmers’ ‘pain’ points.
These include, but not limited to, inadequate access to technical extension advice on farming, connecting farmers to necessary inputs and services to support their agricultural production.  “One of the elements addressed by this innovation is the issue of limited real time operational information on pricing and markets, information on the prevailing diseases and cures, haphazard and uncoordinated agricultural processes, which affect yield quantity and quality,” said NetOne. “The platform will also eradicate the ‘middle man’ effect thereby increasing profit margins for the farmer. “This means farmers will also not be found wanting in terms of agricultural regulations caused by weak communication links to direct networks within the ecosystem, NetOne Hurudza/Umlimi Omkhulu is the only way for any farmer.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-613629" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/NetOne-introduces-smart-agric-platform.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/NetOne-introduces-smart-agric-platform.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/NetOne-introduces-smart-agric-platform-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The telecommunications service provider said the ‘smart agriculture’ platform also provides a marketplace, which gives an opportunity to farmers to access information on a number of players in the market, opportunities to farmers, Governments and agricultural produce suppliers locally and internationally. “The platform allows one to have access to information related supporting industries for farm inputs, equipment and financiers,” reads the statement. “This NetOne innovation will capacitate every farmer to have access to information despite their location or whether one has a smart phone or not as it is also accessed through USSD.” Further, NetOne said the new product was in line with its empowerment pillar meant to bridge the digital divide in terms of access to information and connecting the unconnected. — @SikhulekelaniM1
