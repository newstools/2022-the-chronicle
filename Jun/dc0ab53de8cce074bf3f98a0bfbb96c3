CONSUMERS have decried the sharp increase in bread price, which has gone up by about 40 percent to $640 from $450 last week saying the commodity is now beyond the reach of many.  <img class="alignnone wp-image-615058 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A snap survey conducted by Business Chronicle in Bulawayo’s Central Business yesterday revealed that major retailers had increased prices for a loaf of bread to above $600.

Those selling from their houses are selling a loaf for $500 but demand cash. “This is shocking, why do bakeries price themselves out of the market like this?” said one of the customers at a local supermarket who declined to be named.  Another customer said she she has since stopped buying bread. “I stopped buying bread when it reached $340 a few weeks back,” she said.

Consumers said the exorbitant prices of bread had forced them to turn to alternatives such as sweet potatoes, samp or rice while others are now baking their own bread or buns at home. Contacted for comment, Consumer Council of Zimbabwe regional manager for Matabeleland, Mr Comfort Muchekeza, called for stakeholders engagement to address the prices hike issue.
