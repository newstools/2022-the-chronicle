THE design of the 10MW Hydro Power Station to be constructed at Lake Gwayi-Shangani will be finalised this month while a treatment plant that will process water from the dam for Bulawayo residents will provide 220 Mega Litres per day.  The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) and the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) are expected to finalise designs of the mini-hydropower plant and the subsequent electricity transmission infrastructure this month end. The completion of the massive project is expected to transform lives in Matabeleland through the establishment of a 10 000-hectare irrigation belt along the pipeline to Bulawayo. <img class="size-full wp-image-617398" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Lake-Mutirikwi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Lake-Mutirikwi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Lake-Mutirikwi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lake Mutirikwi Lake Gwayi-Shangani construction is part of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project (NMZWP) which upon completion is expected to provide a permanent water solution for Bulawayo and Matabeleland region. The lake is the third largest water body in the country after Lake Mutirikwi and Togwi-Mukosi. The project is already employing 500 locals and more will be employed when contractors scale up the laying of the 245km Gwayi-Shangani-Bulawayo pipeline. <img class="size-full wp-image-617265" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-2-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-2-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-2--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lake Gwayi-Shangani dam construction The construction of the dam is reportedly about 66 percent complete and work has started on the pipeline.
Acting Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Jenfan Muswere told a post Cabinet briefing that a lot of progress has been registered in the construction of Lake Gwayi-Shangani. “Regarding hydro-power generation, the final design capacity of the plant is 10 megawatts. The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) and the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) will finalise the design of the mini-hydro power plant and the subsequent electricity evacuation infrastructure by end of this month. The power generated will be fed into the national grid and assist in achieving self-sufficiency in power generation as well as rural industrialisation for the benefit of local communities,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-615205" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-35-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-35-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-35-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement, Dr Anxious Masuka Minister Muswere said a progress report on the dam construction, irrigation development and hydropower penetration was presented by the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka. “Cabinet wishes to inform the nation that construction of the Gwayi-Shangani dam is now at 66,2 percent completion. The contractor is now working on the dam wall. The process of gazetting the Gwayi-Shangani dam as a lake is in progress. Excavations for the permanent access road commenced on 14 March 2022. The road will provide access to the mini-hydropower house. The nation is also informed that contracts for civil works for the pipeline were signed on 7 April 2022 and sites were handed over to 11 contractors. All the contractors are now on site and 68 km of the 252 km pipeline route have been cleared while 6 km have been excavated,” he said . <img class="size-full wp-image-613705" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Jenfan-Muswere.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Jenfan-Muswere.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Jenfan-Muswere-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Jenfan Muswere Minister Muswere said work on the 220 Mega Litres per day Treatment Plant at Cowdray Park is at the tendering stage with bids having closed on June 10. He said treated water will be pumped directly to the 108 ML Magwegwe Clear Water Reservoir for onward distribution to the City of Bulawayo. In terms of irrigation development, the Minister said Government has engaged chiefs in Lupane, Binga and Hwange and the communities have understood the thrust of the projects thereby generating a lot of interest. “Both communal and commercial irrigation blocks have been identified. The process of identifying irrigation pumping points is now complete. The 200 irrigation hectares per district under the Vision 2030 accelerator model is receiving urgent priority and the irrigation for Bulawayo peri-urban areas was discussed,” said Minister Muswere. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617261" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities is working on model rural homesteads designs which will be built as compensation for more than 700 villagers who will be relocated as a result of the Lake Gwayi/Shangani- Bulawayo pipeline. “The homesteads will have modern ablution facilities. Valuations for compensation have been completed. The thrust is building formal and better houses with modern designs reflecting rural development as espoused in Vision 2030,” said Minister Muswere.
