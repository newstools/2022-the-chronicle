WHILE awaiting the local authority to approve their structural plan before giving their new home a facelift, Bulawayo Chiefs have spruced up Bulawayo City Village (formerly AmaZulu Sports Club) for temporary use. Chiefs’ women’s team, Amakhosikazi, were the first to use the facility for a competitive event when they made their Southern Region Division One Women’s Football League debut last weekend in an emphatic 6-0 win over ZRP Bulawayo. The build-up to the women’s opening fixture by Chiefs’ secretariat was admirable, as they put in the same energy that they do while propping up  their men’s side in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. <img class="alignnone wp-image-618724 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-27-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-27-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-27-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> To start with, all material benefits that the men’s side enjoys have been extended to the women’s team. Chiefs presented each member of the women’s team with a training kit, tracksuit, personalised playing kits (home, away and alternative kits), which are all produced by the club’s clothing line, Amakhosi Wear. They held a photoshoot for the women’s team and on match day and their dressing room was prepared in similar fashion to the men’s PSL teams’ standards. The players found their kits prepared in the dressing room, and in the centre was a table of rehydration supplements and refreshments, including fruits.  Thulani “Javas” Sibanda, Chiefs’ communications manager said his club strives to uphold admirable standards by maintaining gender balance.  “Bulawayo Chiefs FC is a growing brand and we understand the importance of keeping the brand visible and captivating. When we set out to establish a women’s side, we undertook to maintain gender balance by ensuring that both the men’s and women’s teams enjoy the same or similar benefits. The ladies started off brightly at home and we hope they continue with that trend. “Even our developmental men’s side, which is a feeder to the senior team and has been playing friendly matches, also enjoys the same benefits. So, you may say we’re trendsetters, but we like to maintain the standard,” said Sibanda. Giving an update on the Bulawayo Chiefs Village, Sibanda said plans have been drawn and adjustments on what needs to be done at the facility are being made. <img class="alignnone wp-image-618733 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “But while waiting for the council to approve the plans, we worked on dressing rooms’ ablution facilities and showers. We’ve also been maintaining the playing field as well as the whole facility. “On the administrative side, our media department and other administration personnel have moved from the city office to here (Bulawayo Chiefs Village) as we begin the process of relocating operations,” he said. Chiefs plan to turn their village into a multi-purpose facility, with part of the site plan including “a mini-hotel” where the teams will camp. The lodgings will also accommodate players from outside Bulawayo. Septic tanks behind the main field have forced Chiefs to abandon its desire of setting up a training ground and instead opt to use the bulk of that space to build a mini-hotel as well as Five-A-Side, tennis, basketball and volleyball courts. <img class="alignnone wp-image-618730 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-29-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-29-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-29-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Unlike in the past when Bulawayo City Council leased out AmaZulu Sports Club for a long period, the local authority has decided on five-year leases after noting that tenants were not developing the facility and at times even accrued huge bills. Chiefs are not deterred by the short lease, as they are confident that the investment they will pump into the project will get them an extension. <img class="wp-image-501719 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Thulani-“Javas”-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Thulani-“Javas”-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Thulani-“Javas”-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thulani “Javas” Sibanda In 2012, council leased out the facility to AmaZulu for 10 years and the agreement was due to expire this year, but it was terminated following a number of breaches, including failure to make lease payments and to maintain the facility. In 2018, Chicken Inn FC made a failed bid to lease AmaZulu Sports Club in vain. Chiefs are the fourth club to own a clubhouse in Bulawayo after Highlanders, Zimbabwe Saints and Bulawayo City FC. Highlanders’ clubhouse is at the corner of Fife Street and Masotsha Ndlovu Avenue, with Zimbabwe Saints housed in Queens Park East, while Bulawayo City’s home is at Crescent Sports Club in Parkview. — @ZililoR
