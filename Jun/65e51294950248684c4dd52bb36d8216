She was buried at Jimkani Cemetery in Habane Township. She was conferred liberation war heroine status on Sunday and accorded a State-assisted burial. Among those who came to pay their respects were Matabeleland South Minister of Provincial Affairs and Devolution and Zanu-PF Politburo member Abedinico Ncube; Zanu-PF Matabeleland South provincial chairman Cde Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zanu-PF deputy secretary for security in the Politburo Cde Tendai Chirau, among other dignitaries. The late Cde Mpofu, affectionately known as NaBorder, was described as a hardworking political strategist who loved her party and most importantly her country. The liberation war heroine, a graduate of the national youth service, named her son after the late national hero Border Gezi. The atmosphere in Habane Township was punctuated with sloganeering, dancing and singing as Zanu-PF cadres bade Cde Mpofu farewell and celebrated her life. Hundreds of toyi toying Zanu-PF supporters accompanied the hearse carrying Cde Mpofu’s body from her house in Habane Township to the cemetery singing revolutionary songs. <img class="wp-image-618862 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-4-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-4-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-4-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Evelyn Mpofu At the graveside, a gun salute from members of the Zimbabwe National Army was fired in her honour as Cde Mpofu’s body was lowered into the grave. Minister Ncube said the party and country had lost a comrade and friend. “She clearly stood as an unparalleled example of selflessness and dedication to be called for national unity and safeguarding the revolution. The district has lost a sociable comrade who could fit into society. She was a fearless female comrade who defied gender through the exhibition of positive energy and love,” said Minister Ncube “Let me express my profound gratitude to His Excellency and President of Zimbabwe Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and the ruling party for conferring Cde Evelyn Mpofu the liberation war heroine status. It is indeed humbling and an honour to us as a province.” Zanu-PF Matabeleland South provincial chairman who is also the Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism, and Hospitality Industry, Cde Ndlovu said people should emulate the late Cde Mpofu who was peaceful, humble and patriotic. “Who will tell these stories today, when Cde NaBorder is no more. <img class="wp-image-610998 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/President-Mnangagwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/President-Mnangagwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/President-Mnangagwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa She would go everywhere and boldly talk about Zanu-PF and President ED Mnangagwa. This revolution requires us cadres to rise and defend it with all that we have.  “In honour of NaBorder, Cde Mpofu, I want to appeal to all cadres, you can never build Zanu-PF alone. Zanu-PF is a party that welcomes everyone and let us all invest our time in grooming those people,” said Cde Ndlovu. Politburo member Cde Chirau said” “NaBorder was a peaceful woman who was a political strategist that you would take for granted to your own detriment. She knew how to work with people of all classes and she related to them. All these people who are here show that she was a person of the people,” said Cde Ndlovu. He urged people not to sell their country “for 12 pieces of silver”. “It is the plan of the opposition so that there be violence and they provoke Zanu-PF members to the point that they retaliate. Our President has preached that we avoid violence and preach peace. “I for one cannot wait for the Patriot Bill to be passed into an act. We have people who sit in Parliament and advocate for sanctions that cause so much suffering,” said Cde Ndlovu. He said people should not be blinded as for the past five years, President Mnangagwa has made strides in developing the country. <img class="wp-image-617265 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-2-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-2-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/gwayi-shangani-2--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lake Gwayi-Shangani dam construction “We are not talking about the Gwayi Shangani Dam, which took years and years to take off, but now in these past five years, it will be complete by this year’s end. The Beitbridge Border post will be the most modernised land border post in Africa, but people’s attention is being diverted by this,” said Cde Ndlovu. He said people should see that economic imperialists are attacking the local currency so that people feel the pinch. Cde Chirau said he worked with Cde Mpofu in the youth service and in the party when he was the chairperson of the youth league. Cde Chirau described Cde Mpofu as a committed cadre, who encouraged the youth to be enterprising. “We have a cadre that was dedicated to the party and the empowerment of young people. The party is poorer without Cde Mpofu, because we had a fearless and responsible cadre,” said Cde Chirau, before thanking the President for conferring the liberation war heroine status. Zanu-PF central committee member, Cde Sibongile Sibanda said Cde Mpofu’s death saddened her as the party lost a fearless woman. Cde Talent Moyo said he lost a sister who did not hold grudges. Cde Charity Ndlovu also concurred with Cde Mpofu describing her as a peacemaker. <img class="wp-image-608494 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) Cde Mpofu was born on September 24 in 1984 at the United Bulawayo Hospitals and did her early primary school education at Reigate Primary School in Bulawayo up to grade five before transferring to Mvuthu Primary School in Habane, Esigodini.
