Efforts by a community anti-stocktheft committee in Irisvale, Esigodini proved worthwhile after they ambushed cattle rustlers who had slaughtered five beasts which were destined for Bulawayo. The cattle rustlers were intercepted by a 10-member anti-stocktheft committee led by Councillor Jabulani Makhala on Monday. One person was apprehended while three others are still on the run. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the incident. <img class="wp-image-616069 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-151.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-151.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-151-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Recovered slaughtered beasts “On the 5th of June, the complainant penned off his 19 head of cattle at Irisvale grazing area. On the 6th of June at around 3AM, Irisvale Village anti-stocktheft team was on patrol within their area when they noticed a suspicious vehicle, a Mazda Titan,” said Insp Mangena. <img class="wp-image-540003 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Inspector-Loveness-Mangena.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Inspector-Loveness-Mangena.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Inspector-Loveness-Mangena-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Loveness Mangena She said they blocked the road using logs and rocks after which they started monitoring the vehicle’s movements. “The vehicle later came back with four accused persons carrying five carcasses of unskinned cattle. When these four accused noticed that the road was blocked, they ran away and left the car. The village anti-stocktheft team managed to arrest one of them, Clifford Charm Kunene (34) of House Number 2290 Pumula South, Bulawayo. They then reported the case to Esigodini Police Station and Clifford Charm Kunene implicated the co-accused persons and confessed that they were coming from Bulawayo. The owner of the cattle is Mr Miclous Dube of Irisvale Village under Chief Mabhena, Esigodini,” said Insp Mangena. She said the other suspects who are on the run have only been identified as Mathe and Ndlovu while the third one is not known. “As police officers we’re encouraging villagers to join these community policing initiatives such as the village anti-stocktheft committee to assist police to reduce cases of stocktheft.  They must also join neighbourhood watch committees and business against crime committees so that we assist each other in reducing crime in general,” said Insp Mangena. She said police were appealing for information that may lead to the arrest of the three suspects who are on the run. Increased stocktheft is threatening the source of livelihood of many farmers in Matabeleland South province which is a livestock farming area. The nine-year mandatory sentence for stocktheft does not seem to be deterrent enough as daring culprits keep breaking the law. Mr Dube, the owner of the five slaughtered beasts worth about US$3 000 was at a loss for words as he had been dealt a huge blow. “Cattle rustlers must be locked up for lengthy periods because if they’re let out, they’ll repeat the same crime. “Two of the slaughtered beasts were pregnant while the other ones had calves. The calves are still missing and the remaining cattle are still scattered. I’m still to round them all up,” said Mr Dube. He continued: “The cattle were out grazing and drinking water at the dam. The cattle rustlers were axing the hinds of the cattle so that they wouldn’t run away.” <img class="wp-image-616075 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-152.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-152.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-152-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stocktheft Mr Dube said he was grateful to the anti-stocktheft committee which had intercepted the cattle rustlers. “If it weren’t for the committee, these criminals would’ve left with my cattle without me knowing it and we would have never found these cattle,” said Mr Dube. Irisvale anti-stocktheft chairperson Clr Makhala said rampant stocktheft in the area had resulted in the formation of the committee. “We came up with various committees to curb stocktheft after the realisation that a lot of our cattle were being stolen. This awakened something in us as the community from Village 8 and we agreed that every car that entered our village after 10PM would be stopped and the driver questioned about their business in the area as well as have the vehicle searched,” said Clr Makhala. He said in the latest incident, one of the villagers had raised alarm of a suspicious looking vehicle. “We woke up and quickly ran to block the road with logs and rocks. Around 2.50AM, the vehicle appeared and we hid in the bushes. Upon realising that the road was blocked, the driver tried to reverse but got stuck. We then ran towards the vehicle so that we could scare the rustlers but they quickly jumped out of the vehicle and ran away. We ran after them but only managed to catch one, who was the slowest,” said Clr Makhala. He said the unity among villagers is such that no criminal element would succeed in the area. “We’re walking in the same spirit and it has started working for us. There’s no foreign vehicle that comes here and we are not aware of it. We question anyone who is found in the bushes at odd hours who they are, what they are looking for and where they are coming from. “Anyone who comes to our area must pass through the headman so that when we find them in the paddocks, they have been approved to be there. “When they’re leaving the paddocks, they must also report to us that they’re now leaving. If they’re leaving with cattle, we also check if none of our cattle are among the ones leaving,” said Clr Makhala. He said the anti-stocktheft committee works closely with the local police so that they remain within the confines of the law. – @Yolisswa.
