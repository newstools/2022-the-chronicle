The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) successfully hosted a basic and intermediate coaching course for school teachers in Gwanda and Hwange in a bid to try and develop the game in schools and remote areas. Running under the mantra “game development”, the coaching course was meant to spread and revive the game of cricket countrywide. The coaching staff is now in Victoria Falls conducting their last course ending on 31 July. “We saw it fit to run courses for coaches and schools as we are trying to spread the game countrywide,” said Zimbabwe Cricket coach education officer Stanley Timoni. He said he believes that the role of coaches is critical in the development of cricket hence the decision to run the courses.  In order to successfully complete the course, one must first attend practical and theory classes and after that they will sit for an exam. Successful candidates will be awarded certificates, Timon said the response was overwhelming, a confirmation that the coaches are taking the training seriously. Gwanda had 12 attendants including two school leavers, Hwange 30 and in Victoria Falls there are 25 participants. “We are happy that their respective schools are going to benefit from the coaches new skills,” said Timoni. Zimbabwe Cricket has been conducting coaching courses for some time as they try to spread the game. They had the programme in 2017 and 2018 through the ministry of sport but got disrupted following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
