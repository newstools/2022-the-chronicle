THE Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Primary and Secondary Education is confident that the reduction of the Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (Zimsec) November exams fees is all but imminent following widespread cries that the fees were beyond the reach of ordinary Zimbabweans. On Thursday last week the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education permanent secretary Mrs Thabela Tumisang and the Zimsec director Dr Lazarus Nembaware appeared before the portfolio committee where, according to the chairperson of the committee Cde Torerai Moyo, they also acknowledged that the fees were high for ordinary Zimbabweans, especially the rural-based ones. <img class="size-full wp-image-575816" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Tumisang Thabela Last week, Child president Unathi Nyoni said the fees were against the ethos of leaving no one and no place behind as advocated by the Second Republic under President Mnangagwa. The Child president said the figures were clearly beyond the reach of many learners’ parents or guardians and could lead to some of them not sitting for their examinations which will be a direct violation of their right to basic education as enshrined in the Zimbabwe Constitution. He said some of the learners will now be forced to write fewer subjects, against their choice as a result of the high fees. According to Zimsec, Grade Seven examination fees will be US$30 for all the subjects, Ordinary Level fees were pegged at US$11 per subject for candidates in public, local authority-run, and non-profit-making schools with the Government paying a subsidy of US$24 while those in private schools and colleges shall fork US$24 per subject. <img class="size-full wp-image-622792" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Child-President-Unathi-Nyoni.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Child-President-Unathi-Nyoni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Child-President-Unathi-Nyoni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Child President Unathi Nyoni Advanced Level candidates in public and local authority-run schools will pay US$22 per subject with the Government contributing US$26 in subsidy. Private schools and college candidates shall pay US$48 per subject. All payments however, shall be in local currency at the prevailing interbank rate upon the opening window for examination fees payment on July 22. “The permanent secretary and Zimsec director appeared before our committee. We made it clear to them that these figures were well beyond the reach of our people, especially those based in the rural areas and both of them agreed with our position and for now we shall vigorously push for the reduction of the figures or demand that the Government increases its subsidy,” said Cde Moyo.  The Government is subsidising fees by 55 percent for learners attending public or local authority-run institutions as well as non profit making mission schools. “We will not tire in our call for the fees to be reduced,” said Cde Moyo.
