President Mnangagwa said Dr Nkomo’s exploits dating back to the days of the African National Congress, through to the days of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Zapu and ultimately the united Zanu-PF, are well documented, and shall forever be imprinted in the history of Zimbabwe, Sadc and of the African continent. He said as the nation moves towards attainment of Vision 2030, the foundational work of this great luminary continues to inspire and to enlighten the path. “We shall always remember and cherish Dr Nkomo’s achievements and vision. May the soul of Umdala Wethu continue to rest in eternal peace. Long live our unity, peace and freedom. Long live Zimbabwe,” said the President. <img class="size-full wp-image-445571" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/The-Late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/The-Late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/The-Late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo In an earlier interview on Monday, President Mnangagwa said the memory of the late veteran nationalist must be kept alive from generation to generation in honour of his contribution to the country’s liberation.
