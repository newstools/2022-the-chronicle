The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter CIVIL servants have ignored calls by their union leaders to down tools with Government yesterday saying negotiations for their improved conditions service were still ongoing. In an interview, Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister, Professor Paul Mavima, said the Government has always been prepared to engage with the union leaders and shall continue on the same engagement policy. He said they will be meeting with the union leaders on Monday next week ahead of a Tripartite Negotiating Forum meeting on Thursday.  “What the Government has continued saying to all unions and associations is that engagement is the only way we can resolve issues affecting everyone including those faced by the country,” said the minister. “I urge them to come back to the negotiating table. It is important to engage and avoid being confrontational all the time.” He said the failure of the two-day strike called by the civil servants’ unions vindicates the Government’s call that only dialogue was the tool to labour sanity. <img class="wp-image-632641 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> strike “I am glad that the rest of the civil servants are saying let us continue to offer our services, the ethics and call to serve still exists in our civil servants,” said Prof Mavima. Government this month effected a 100 percent salary hike for its workers but the employees still argue that it fell short of their demands. Despite monetary rewards the Government also introduced a vehicle import scheme for qualifying members who have served at least 10 years in the public service and to date 6 848 public sector workers have benefited from the scheme.
