Each and everyone’s cooperation is highly commended as we are all in a joint force in the fight against HIV and Aids and TB. “Collectively we will definitely accomplish our departmental, national and subsequently regional goals. We need to continue probing further into sustainable strategies for permanently eradicating the HIV and Aids and TB related diseases,” he said.  Commissioner General Chihobvu said the theme aptly described the comprehensive management to be incurred in order to curb challenges on HIV and Aids and TB, which had been exacerbated by Covid-19 pandemic among the uniformed forces, communities and nation at large. He said there is need to fight stigma which is more damaging than the diseases themselves. “We now need as a collective to restrategise and redirect our efforts and resources towards reducing new HIV infections in the vulnerable age groups like young women who according to NAC are highly affected,” he said. Commissioner General Chihobvu said there is a need to empower the girl child through programmes that support their aspirations such as the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, Aids Free, Mentored (Dreams) initiative. -@ncubeleon
