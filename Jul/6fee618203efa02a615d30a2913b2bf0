The facilitators for the programme that ended at the weekend were ZVA vice-president (technical) Molet Mathema and international referee Sibangani Mashasha. “We had a capacity development programme at Tongogara Refugee Camp that we organised as a province and had ZVA sending facilitators.  A total of 63 refugees were trained in coaching and refereeing. They were taught the rules of the game, coaching philosophy, anti-doping and safe sport, as well as fair play. Our goal is inclusion of the refugees to mainstream sport by bringing sport to,” said Kabunu. He said they will continue to assist refugees in setting up teams that will be allowed to compete in provincial competitions.
