QUALITY Foods coach Loverty Mabunda has promised to make the most out of his team’s clash with Arenel in the Zifa Southern Region Division One encounter at White City Stadium tomorrow. Arenel are second on the table with 48 points from 21 games and are just three points behind log leaders Hwange FC.
Quality Foods are in 14th place with 20 points from 21 encounters, and a point above the relegation zone.  “Playing against Arenal is not going to be easy because they are on a good run. They have seasoned players in their squad and some of them have played in the topflight league. Given their position on the table, we expect them to attack us from the first whistle, but we will fight. We know we are the underdogs, but we will not make it easy for them,” said Mabunda. <img class="wp-image-604248 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> White City Stadium Quality Foods have in their ranks the league’s top goal scorer Stanson Khanye, who has 15 goals in 21 matches this season. “Khanye is on top of his game and I believe this is the game for him to shine and show people why he is the leading scorer in the league. We are playing a top side and there is no better game for him to prove his capabilities than a game as this one. I’m happy for him and also credit the whole team that is pushing him to score more goals,” said Mabunda. Elsewhere, Hwange date Zimbabwe Saints at White City B Arena, with the former topflight league side hoping to maintain its grip at the top of the table. Talen Vision will host Indlovu Iyanyathela in Filabusi on Sunday. <img class="wp-image-618769 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/stanson.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/stanson.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/stanson-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stanson Khanye Fixtures
