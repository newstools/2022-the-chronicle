The Chronicle CAF is considering rescheduling the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote d’Ivoire. The last edition was held in January this year in Cameroon and the highest-ranked African side, the Teranga Lions of Senegal, won the edition for the first time in their history. Next year’s edition in Cote d’Ivoire is scheduled for June 23 to July 23 when the climatic conditions in the West African nation may not be suitable for football.  Caf authorities are concerned the condition next summer is likely to be a repeat of what has happened so far this year and the body thinks hosting the tournament in the middle of the rain season might not be a good idea. According to Le Monde, Caf secretary general Veron Mosengo-Omba confirmed that they were looking into the matter. He said Caf is open to the possibility of postponing the football fiesta to a more convenient date. “We are considering it; it is one of the possibilities. We asked Ivorian meteorologists to report to us on rainfall history in Côte d’Ivoire in June and July, and also to share their projections with us,” Mosengo-Omba said. — The Niche
