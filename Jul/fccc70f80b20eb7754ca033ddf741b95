Ulenje leader, Mthokozisi Moyo, said this gave them hope that they were capable of winning. He said they had faith in their craft and the efforts they had put in during practice with the win coming as a fulfilment of their expectations. For this year’s competition, the 10 member-group exhibited amabhiza dance. “During practice, we dedicated ourselves and members of the group worked tirelessly, something which sometimes, worried me. However, we expected to win this one because in 2019, we almost did and that on its own, gave us a reason to push harder. “We’re excited to have won and gotten an opportunity to represent Bulawayo. We’ll do all that we can to bring something positive back home,” said Moyo. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623710" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chibuku-Neshamwari.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chibuku-Neshamwari.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chibuku-Neshamwari-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The group was up against Mthwakazi, Woza Africa, Isizwe Sabatsha, Iluba Lemvelo, Khami Maximum, Jaiva Arts, Ibutho Performing Arts, Bambanani traditional dance group, and Thandanani women’s ensemble.
