VETERAN coach, Cosmas Tsano Zulu has been suspended from his goalkeepers’ trainer role at Ngezi Platinum Stars, pending outcome of an investigation into allegations that he was undermining authority within the technical set-up. <img class="wp-image-630388 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-265.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-265.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-265-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ngezi Platinum Stars Sources allege that the veteran, who joined Ngezi in 2017 and has survived the chop following the ouster of two coaches – Erol Akbay and Rodwell Dhlakama – has been undermining the Benjani Mwaruwari led technical team that has been going through a rough patch. Ngezi confirmed Zulu’s suspension, adding that they have “adequate” technical personnel to cover the trainer’s duties while the club institutes internal disciplinary processes. “Ngezi Platinum Stars Football Club would like to confirm the suspension of our Goalkeeper’s coach, Cosmas Zulu, over a disciplinary matter that is currently under investigation. “The Club is in no position to comment further over the matter until the investigation has been completed. “The Club has adequate technical resources to cover Goalkeeper’s coach roles in the meantime while this internal disciplinary process is going on,” reads Ngezi’s response. Mwaruwari retained Zulu as well as assistant coach Takesure Chiragwi when he replaced Dhlakama in March. <img class="wp-image-622261 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bongani Mafu The former Warriors captain arrived at Ngezi with Bongani Mafu (assistant coach), team manager Tinashe Nengomasha and Tonderai Vera as the performance analyst. Meanwhile, Ngezi reaffirmed its support for the former Manchester City striker, who is on his first coaching job. Mwaruwari has managed to pick up 15 points from the 12 games he has been in charge of the club, winning three, drawing six and losing three. When he took over from Dhlakama, Ngezi had played nine games and accumulated 15 points from four wins, three draws and two defeats. Ngezi’s management is hopeful that Mwaruwari will strike the right chord and lift the team. <img class="wp-image-598396 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ngezi Platinum Stars head coach Benjani Mwaruwari “When the Club engaged Coach Benjani, we were aware that this is his first coaching job, and that this season will involve a lot of learning and gelling of the team to develop a winning side. While the current results are not pleasing, we appreciate that this is a learning curve for everyone involved and we are confident that there will be an improvement going forward.  “We are however acutely aware that this is a process which may take some time and we need to ensure that the technical team continues to get the support which they require. We are looking forward to seeing Coach Benjani’s philosophy bear positive results for the Club and all our supporters and stakeholders,” said the club. Mwaruwari is on record saying he is targeting a top four finish. Ngezi, who face Yadah tomorrow in Harare are on position eight with 30 points from 21 matches. They are just three points adrift of fourth placed Manica Diamonds.
