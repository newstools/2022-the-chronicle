The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SENIOR players who missed Bulawayo Chiefs’ last two matches will have to work hard to get into the team as those who started impressed. The quartet of experienced twin-defenders, Elvis and Kevin Moyo, defensive midfielder Kelvin Madzongwe and forward Perfect Chikwende, all with national team caps, missed the 3-1 defeat to Chicken Inn and last weekend’s 2-0 away win at Tenax CS FC.  It was a crucial win for Chiefs who had gone for a four-match winless streak. The barren spell had included a draw and three consecutive defeats. The victory at Tenax, without some of their experienced players, will certainly boost Chiefs’ confidence ahead of their clash against Dynamos in Harare. Just like Chiefs, DeMbare bounced back to winning ways last weekend when they plucked Chicken Inn’s wings 3-0 in Bulawayo, putting to an end a four-match winless run of two draws and two defeats. <img class="wp-image-624547 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso has seen some positives from the players he assigned to do duty against Chicken Inn and Tenax. They hardly missed the quartet of Moyo twins, Madzongwe and Chikwende. “Every player has played and every player when they have an opportunity they come in and are able to perform as well. Of course, we do have important players but we don’t have one player who is important than the others,” said Terroso, responding on the absence of the quartet. One of the players, who has been a marvel for Chiefs to an extent that they hardly felt the absence of experienced members of the squad, is 22-year-old central attacking midfielder Mthokozisi Msebe. <img class="wp-image-589909 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-20-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-20-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-20-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kelvin Madzongwe Blessed with pace, skill and game intelligence, Msebe, a former Zim Leopards has been a marvel for Chiefs, giving them creativity in the midfield as well as creating scoring opportunities that their strikers have been guilty of fluffing. Against Dynamos, who they are facing for the sixth time since their promotion into the top-flight in 2018, Chiefs can’t afford to waste their chances as DeMbare, who are keen on getting their title hopes on track, punished Chicken Inn for being wasteful. In their previous meetings played in Harare, Chiefs held Dynamos to a goalless draw in 2018 and in 2019 they drew 1-1. <img class="wp-image-621910 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dynamos In matches that they played in Bulawayo, Dynamos edged Chiefs 1-0 in 2018, before the Ninjas beat them 2-0 the following season. In the first leg of the 2021/22 season, DeMbare won 2-0. But on Sunday, Chiefs head to Harare with a positive attitude as they are coming from a morale boosting win and they will also be out to maintain their unbeaten record against DeMbare in the capital. Besides Msebe, Chiefs can bank on 21-year-old goalkeeper Matripples Muleya, veteran Ben Nyahunzwi, who has done well since coming in for Kevin at central defence where he partners skipper Marlvin Mkolo, Elvis’ replacement at left back Tarisai Chikwende and the central midfield pair of Hughe Chikosa and Lucky Ndlela. They also have pint-sized attacking midfielder Arthur Musiyiwa, lanky and pacey forward Billy Veremu, as well as the striking pair of Obriel Chirinda and Farau Matare to lead their search for goals. But Chiefs should not expect a walk in the park as Dynamos have equally good players to match them. <img class="wp-image-630997 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Perfect Chikwende Just like Chiefs, Dynamos were without left back Brendon Mpofu, utility player Shadreck Nyahwa, attacking midfielder King Nadolo and winger Bill Antonio who is attending trials in Belgium, when they stunned Chicken Inn. Mzilikazi-bred teenager Junior Makunike, who scored Dynamos’ second goal against Chicken Inn, skipper Patson Jaure, utility player Godknows Murwira, striker Tinashe Makanda and midfielder Keith Murera are some of the players expected to carry the day for DeMbare.
