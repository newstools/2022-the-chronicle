WOMEN-LED business projects are breaking new ground through micro-fundraising platforms that pool resources from regular savings by members. The model is paying dividends as members are able to generate capital to sustain business operations, pay bills and facilitate acquisition of relevant equipment. Mrs Bekezela Maplanka, who leads the Bulawayo Queens, a women’s fundraising platform and owns a lodge in the city, says the Covid-19 lockdown experience has inspired them to think outside the box and tap into new opportunities. During the 2020 lockdowns, she noted, many people lost business as they were not able to sell their products as shops were being closed early and those who deal with perishables were affected the most. <img class="wp-image-616729 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-19-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-19-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-19-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> WhatsApp “After we realised that many players in business are women, we started a ‘WhatsApp group’ in 2020, which provided women a marketing platform,” she said. Mrs Maplanka said the women later formed different fundraising groups, which helped boost businesses. She said the members are now pooling resources to inject new capital into their businesses, drill boreholes, buy cars and build houses. Bulawayo Queens was formed in 2020 as a marketing platform and it now has 1 500 members who are working on big projects. Mrs Maplanka said the members are engaged in different business projects depending on the amount of capital one has as the platform accommodates everyone.  Mrs Pretty Tshuma, one of the beneficiaries, said she has used the platform to boost her poultry project, which was affected by the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. “Before joining the Bulawayo Queens, it was hard because my project was not big enough to generate a good profit,” she said. Mrs Tshuma said she got capital injection from the group and was now making as much as US$600 profit per month. She said she is now able to provide for her family and take care of her extended family. Another beneficiary, Mrs Catharine Kaaraidze, who runs a clothes retail shop said she was grateful to Bulawayo Queens as she managed to buy a car as a result of the group’s fundraising initiative. <img class="wp-image-626338 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-151.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-151.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-151-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Toyota Mark X “I’m happy because I joined the car project fundraising and I managed to buy a Toyota Mark X,” she said. Mrs Sinikiwe Ndlovu said the fundraising project has helped her build a house. Mrs Alice Zhuwaki, who is also into retailing and cross-border trading, said she fundraised to drill a borehole. “I’m happy now because the borehole is helping in reducing council bills and I am now able to do gardening,” she said.
