The ones I brought in as extras because I wanted them practicing in case of injury are John Masara from Mutare, Ainsley Ndlovu, Tanaka Chivanga, Tony Munyonga and Clive Madande. At least they have been practicing, they go back to Harare and somebody will continue practicing with them,’’ Houghton said. Zimbabwe have lots of cricket lined up in the coming weeks.  The Chevrons have just two weeks from the final of the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier to the start of the series against Bangladesh that is followed by India’s visit to the country prior to the team leaving for Australia. For the T20 World Cup Qualifier, Zimbabwe have been boosted by the return of Sean Williams who has been unwell, Richard Ngarava and Wellington Masakadza who have recovered from injury. <img class="wp-image-564573 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/sEAN-wILLIAMS-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/sEAN-wILLIAMS-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/sEAN-wILLIAMS-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sean Williams Zimbabwe will play Singapore in the opening match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Qualifier B 2022 at Queens Sports Club on Monday.
