THE championship race in the Central Region Soccer League (CRSL) is likely to go down to the wire after former Premiership side TelOne FC managed to reduce table toppers Sheasham’s lead to five points. Mid-table side ZPC Munyati did TelOne a favour as they held runaway leaders Sheasham, who are coached by veteran John Nyikadzino to a 0-0 draw, while the former Premiership side that is eyeing a quick topflight return won 2-0 away at Filabusi United. <img class="wp-image-629527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/John-Nyikadzino-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/John-Nyikadzino-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/John-Nyikadzino-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> John Nyikadzino Sheasham, who took their unbeaten run to 22 games have amassed 50 points from 22 games, with TelOne who still harbour championship hopes are five points behind. The championship destiny is no longer in TelOne’s control as Sheasham need eight points from a possible 12 to win the Premiership ticket in the event that the Wi-Fi Boys win all their matches. TelOne may end the season with 57 points if they collect maximum points from their remaining matches. However, the Tendai Chikuni-coached TelOne have what appears to be tough run of games ahead as their next encounter is against ex-Premiership side Chapungu, who beat Bishopstone 3-1 at the weekend. TelOne will then be at home to tricky Beitbridge side Dulibadzimu, who are on position five with 36 points and won 2-1 away in Gokwe against Loss Control. They then visit Loss Control, before wrapping up with a tie against third placed Vubachikwe. The goldminers, Vubachikwe drew 1-1 away to fourth-placed Tongogara as the battle for a respectable finish continues. <img class="wp-image-629530 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-229.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-229.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-229-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> MSU On the other hand, teams standing on Sheasham’s way to the championship are Kwekwe United a side that held them 1-1 in the first leg, army side Tongogara, who they edged 1-0 in Gweru, followed by two away matches at MSU and Loss Control.  Sheasham drew 1-1 with MSU and clobbered Loss Control 3-0 in reverse fixtures. “I think everyone thought we were going to lose at Munyati, but we managed to pick a vital point. Credit to the boys who keep fighting and we are looking forward to the remaining matches. Every game that we play in the countdown to the end of the season is like a final and we will keep giving opposition teams the respect that they deserve,” said Nyikadzino. Meanwhile, the postponed MSU and Paramount United’s fixture will be played today in Mkoba.
