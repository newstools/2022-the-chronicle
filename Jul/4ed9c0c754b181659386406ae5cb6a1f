ZIFA Southern Region Division One outfit Indonsakusa are officially out of the league in what has been described as a major blow for the championship. When United Kingdom-based Nothando Dube founded Indonsakusa in 2020 by acquiring the franchise of Hwange-based Ingagula, who had failed to pay affiliation fees, she had a vision to shine the light on careers of local footballers to showcase their talent and fight for an opportunity to play in the Premier Soccer League. <img class="wp-image-447672 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange FC However, financial constraints have resulted in the side pulling out of the league. The team did well with some good wins posted in the first part of this season. One of those wins was against Lizwe Sweswe’s Talen Vision at Filabusi’s Mthwakazi Stadium. At the half-way stage, Indonsakusa, coached by Chipo Mhlanga and Xolani Nkundlande, were 10th on the 18-team league table with six wins, four draws and seven losses. The team is now facing a collapse, as the owner is putting the franchise up for sale.  The team struggled to conduct training sessions and to book match venues just before the mid-season break. Sources close to the club indicate that the players will be given clearance letters. Zifa Southern Region board member for finance Tizirayi Luphahla said it is unfortunate that the club is pulling out of the league. “It’s quite unfortunate that this has happened, but the league has to go on. The decision that has been made is that every team will get three points and three goals for their second-round fixtures against Indonsakusa. We feel that will be fair to everyone. It’s not good for the league to have situations such as this one, as it’s a blow to how the league had been scheduled,” said Luphahla. Meanwhile, Hwange FC bounced back to winning ways at the weekend after beating Binga Pirates 1-0 at the Colliery.
Hwange now have 51 points, with second-placed Arenel on 48.
