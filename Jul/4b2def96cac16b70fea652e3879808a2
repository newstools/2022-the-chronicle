Several key areas of one’s lifestyle are considered dimensions of overall wellness, and these include social connectedness, exercise, nutrition, sleep and mindfulness.  Each one has an impact on one’s physical and mental health. By making simple and healthy choices on a daily basis, one can reduce stress, have positive social interactions and achieve optimal wellness. “Besides the wellness and sporting aspect of this programme, the whole idea is to bring Parliamentarians to the people, to have that bond with those who make national laws. This is why we came down here and ironically to the home of the late Father Zimbabwe, Umdala Wethu (Dr Joshua Nkomo),” said Mashonaland Central Senator, Cde Angeline Tongogara. <img class="size-full wp-image-556926" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo She said the programme cuts across the political divide. “This programme, which also has the support of the President himself, does not look at one’s political affiliation, as you can see that we are all from different parties here, but we are united by the cause of this programme. The programme has been going on for the past four years and it’s crucial in creating tolerance among different political parties. It creates unity and also takes our young people out of delinquency issues such as drug and alcohol abuse and also reduces issues of teenage pregnancies,” said Sen Tongogara. Mr Bunjira praised the Parliamentarians Sports Club saying physical wellness comes with sharp minds conducive for robust debates in the August House. “These are people who decide our national laws; a very big responsibility which needs one to be sharp and the wellness programme creates that atmosphere,” he said.
