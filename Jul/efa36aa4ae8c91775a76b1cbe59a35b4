THE Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) has reassured winter wheat farmers of uninterrupted power supply during the production cycle as the country moves to boost domestic output and enhance import substitution. <img class="wp-image-619465 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) Zimbabwe needs at least 360 000 tonnes of wheat a year to meet its flour demand. The country is targeting more than 85 000 hectares of wheat this winter to ensure self-sufficiency. Over the years, Zimbabwe, whose national requirement is 360 000 tonnes of wheat annually, has been relying on imports to cover the deficit.  Last year the country put 66 435ha under winter wheat and harvested about 180 000 tonnes. To achieve the set targets, farmers need a constant and uninterrupted power supply to pump water for irrigation. To that end, ZPC acting managing director, Engineer Kenneth Maswera has re-assured wheat farmers of adequate electricity. “As ZPC we are committed to ensure that there is adequate power generation to support winter wheat this year,” he said.
Hwange Power Station is producing about 400 megawatts and Kariba about 1 000 megawatts. <img class="wp-image-586846 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-27-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-27-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-27-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kariba Hydro Power Station Matabeleland South province is said to have surpassed its winter wheat hectarage target by more than 110 percent as the country moves to boost domestic output and meet its local needs. According to a recent Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development winter wheat progress report, 1 800 hectares were targeted for winter wheat production in the province but 5 396 hectares were registered. The Midlands Province has also surpassed its target of winter wheat by more than 1  000 hectares following the extension of the planting period by the Government to increase production of the strategic crop. The winter wheat planting period, which was supposed to end on June 30, was extended following a huge demand on the global market due to Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Agriculture contributes 15 percent to Zimbabwe’s Gross Domestic Product and the target is to increase it to more than 20 percent by 2025.
