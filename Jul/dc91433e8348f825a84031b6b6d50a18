BULAWAYO-born female author Grace Maguri has penned two books to stamp her foot on the literary works sector after procrastinating for a long time. <img class="alignnone wp-image-630718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Song of The Survivor and Picking Ants are the two books that the Dubai-based author has penned. Maguri, Raisedon Baya’s mentee was in the country this month and spoke to Saturday Leisure about her inspiration for authorship and being a teacher before jetting back to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). By a wide margin, African literature always myopically tells stories of the defeated to seek public sympathy, a feat that Maguri wants to challenge with her book Song of The Survivor. “Growing up, I’ve realised that most, if not all of our reads don’t have a happy ending, but end up with an invitation to a pity party where we have victims and not victors or survivors. I don’t think that kind of narrative is a true reflection of what’s on the ground in the precinct. We always tell sob stories of defeat, dejection, sadness, poverty, and depression but forget to tell the ones about victory, happiness, and all the good things. “My new book, Song of The Survivor is a compilation of various local short stories with the focal point being on social and cultural issues that affect our daily lives. Each story examines the plight of the victim and addresses strategies for survival and therefore serves as a directory to those finding themselves in unfortunate circumstances. “I’m a product of abuse in a romantic relationship and this book looks at how one can develop a thick skin in the face of adversity. I think that’s the kind of narrative we need to tell. Out with the old way of telling stories to gain sympathy and in with the new way of providing leverage and power to the oppressed, especially women. We need more victor than victim stories,” said Maguri. <img class="alignnone wp-image-630724 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-15-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-15-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-15-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The author said she is a feminist defined by the struggles she faced while growing up. “I was born and raised in Bulawayo and life was not that rosy at the time. I’m defined by the struggles that I faced while growing up and these sorts of things changed me and made me who I am today. I remember my days at the National University of Science and Technology when I’d struggle to get money for transport. It was rough. “I know what it means to be in an abusive relationship and I got to realise that it’s not always roses and rainbows. So, being in such vulnerable situations kind of shaped me and was a build-up to me writing these books. My wish is to tell stories of triumph and relate to victims of different life situations with the utmost respect,” she said. The advocate for women’s emancipation and feministic prowess said it is about time that the spotlight is shone around gender-based violence (GBV) and the plight of abused women heightened. She gave an example of how GBV has become akin to a pandemic in South Africa where femicide reared its ugly head in recent history. “As a feminist, I believe that more should be done to protect women and children against male predatory behaviour rampant in our society now. <img class="alignnone wp-image-630745 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-16-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-16-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-16-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In South Africa, there was the #StopGBV as a result of incessant reported cases of abuse. Women and children were being wantonly killed and it has to stop. So, my book wants to heighten issues around abuse,” she said. The other book, Picking Ants was burbled by renowned author and Intwasa Arts Festival KoBulawayo Director Raisedon Baya who described the story as one of self-discovery for Portia who was initially in search of her mother. Maguri said Picking Ants is feminine as well and is about women trying to “pick ants” which according to her is, “trying to mould events that originally have a natural flow and try to modify them to your liking. Ants usually walk in a line and do things in whatever way they deem necessary so women have your typical, ‘I will be married at 25, buy a house, graduate, start a business endeavour’ but in the end, God has the final answer to everything and picking ants becomes futile.” Before her twin books which were published by David Sling, Maguri vividly remembers her first encounter with authorship and it was the typical routine that every school-going child goes through, compositions. “Growing up, I wasn’t the brightest of students, and neither was I the smartest. I was scruffy and teachers would always pick on me on those grounds. Irrespective of all of that, my love for reading was evident and I’d always look for material to read. So, one day, I wrote this story and handed it in and the teacher didn’t believe that I wrote it.  “The situation escalated to a beating as I was accused of not only plagiarism but also lying to school authorities. I also got punished and that took a serious toll on my confidence. They didn’t believe that I could conjure up such a creative story. For some time, I doubted my writing skills and put it aside,” she said. Maguri also attributed her authorship career to Raisedon Baya who “is a big bully and a stickler for excellence” when he engages beast mode gear. “Meeting Raisedon Baya was a plus for my career. He doesn’t take no for an answer when he sees potential in someone and is always straight up with you. He is a bully and stickler for excellence and I am what I am because of his mentorship,” Maguri laughingly said. Apart from these books, Maguri has many manuscripts that she has not published. She has also featured in different anthologies including continental Short stories for Africa, Voices that sing behind the veil which is a Ghana product, and many other publications. She has also worked with Baya on a play titled, Sweet Opia. “After working on the play, he urged me to write a book about victors and that’s how Song of The Survivor came about.” Not only is Maguri an author, but she is also a school teacher in Dubai and spends most of her time brainstorming new material for upcoming projects. – @eMKlass_49
