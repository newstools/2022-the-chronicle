The Chronicle BE INSPIRED BY HIS IMMINENT RETURN And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels (2 Thessalonians 1:7). A LOT of people don’t realise that Jesus is coming back. You can tell by the way they live. They live their lives every day, doing whatever they please. Whether they realise it or not, Jesus is coming again. He said He would, and it’s getting closer than ever before. How I look forward to that day! What a day it would be. Will you be ready for Him when He returns? Or will He come back to discover you didn’t do what you were supposed to do? It’s like when a teacher gives his students homework and comes to class the following day to ask for it. The one who did it will be happy to see the teacher, while the one who didn’t would wish the teacher would forget or won’t come to class. <img class="alignnone wp-image-627379 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Bible says, “In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day” (2 Thessalonians 1:8-10). When Jesus comes back, He’ll be admired in those of us that love His appearing. This means His glory will be seen in each one of us. Those who heard us when we said Christ was in us will then see His glory in us and acknowledge it as true. Suddenly, we’ll be glorified, each one of us a bright shining light, and they’ll admire Jesus in us and among us. <img class="alignnone wp-image-627382 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-46-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-46-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-46-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> That day is coming very soon. Jesus said, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). He didn’t just tell us to shine, but to “so shine!” He’s made us a light to the nations and He wants us to light up other people. He wants us to bring life and joy to them as we reach them with the Gospel now more than ever. CONFESSION
I’m walking worthy of the Lord, pleasing Him in all things as I joyfully anticipate His soon return. I’m bearing fruits of righteousness, giving the lives of men and women in my world a meaning. My faith is effective and effectual, producing required results to the glory of God. Amen.
