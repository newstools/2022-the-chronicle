VETERAN actor Zenzo Nyathi has shone spotlight on the need for the old guard to pass the baton to up-and-coming talent. He said this after his successful appearance on Charleston Trust Primary School’s choir video of the song Smile where they also featured poetess Sithandazile Dube. <img class="wp-image-624427 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Charleston Trust Primary School Nyathi, famous for his role as Mzambane in Amakhosi’s flagship yesteryear soapie Amakorokoza, underscored the importance of passing the baton to younger creatives. “I believe in continual learning. So, as we grow older in the entertainment industry or rather creative and cultural industries, it’s important to appreciate that it didn’t start with us nor will it end with us. “Hence, it’s important to teach or rather share our knowledge and experience with the young ones,” Nyathi told Chronicle Showbiz. The actor is a product of Cont Mhlanga’s theatrical stable, Amakhosi where he was once a novice in the early 2000s.
He described working with Charleston Choir as an exciting experience.  “Working with the children was fun and exciting. The zeal and hunger they had were just out of this world. They took control and ownership of their song. They just, but shined,” he said. On future projects, Nyathi promised that there is “so much more coming”, but was not ready to reveal any specifics. It is only a matter of time before the public sees what he has in store. He also assured his fans to continue producing skits that border around societal issues such as violence, love, and unity. Last year, he reunited with fellow Amakorokoza actor, Aleck Zulu (Skoro) to produce skits on topical issues in the country. <img class="wp-image-624418 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-11-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-11-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-11-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Aleck Zulu (Skoro) “I’ll definitely continue shootings skits. The dream is to share one every Saturday or Sunday and then eventually, develop a weekly series.” The award-winning actor’s latest acting stint was on the stage play, “No Easy Walk to Freedom” which premiered in January this year. – @eMKlass_49
