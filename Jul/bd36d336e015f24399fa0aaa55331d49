BULAWAYO City FC have wasted no time in improving their squad in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League mid-season transfer window with the acquisition of midfielders Solomon Sithole and Itai Brighton Makopa. <img class="wp-image-611703 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-33.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-33.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-33-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City FC Sithole joins as a free agent after doing duty for Ajax Hotspurs and Chiwororo in the lower tier, while Makopa was signed from Vumbachikwe. The two were part of the squad that travelled to Mutare for the league match against Manica Diamonds on Sunday which City won 1-0. They both made substitute appearance in the game. Bulawayo City communications and media officer Thandiwe Moyo said they were still in the hunt for more additions to their squad “We still have three slots we want to fill.  So, we will be guided by the coaches on who will be coming on board, but we are almost certain we will make three more signings,” Moyo said. The club is likely to offload some players, but Moyo could not be drawn into commenting on the status of captain Vincent Moyo and midfielder Melikhaya Ncube, who are being eyed by Chicken Inn and Highlanders respectively. <img class="wp-image-592824 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Scorer-.-.-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Scorer-.-.-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Scorer-.-.--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Melikhaya Ncube Their leaving will most likely affect Bulawayo City’s fight for survival. Bulawayo City are second from the bottom of the 18-team league table with 15 points. With Bosso coach Baltemar Brito ruling out any business in the month-long window, the Gamecocks are now favourites to secure both players. Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas has publicly declared his desire to beef up his squad, as they seek their second league title. – @innocentskizoe
