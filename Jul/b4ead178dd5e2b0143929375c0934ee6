The President said in April 2018, he was invited to travel to China during which President Xi Jinping asked him to provide him with four projects, which he would make a political decision on. “Because I was a Speaker of Parliament before, I knew that our current Parliament was small, so I suggested to him to give us a grant to build Parliament and he agreed. So, he has built us the most beautiful, magnificent Parliament on the African continent,” he said.  President Mnangagwa shared with the crowd that he also officiated at the ground-breaking and launching ceremony of a Cyber Smart City. “This year in March, I went to Dubai Expo and I addressed a business forum after which a group of a dozen billionaires invited me privately because they were impressed by our policy of Zimbabwe is Open for Business,” he said.  The President said after addressing the businesspeople, they agreed to come to Zimbabwe and scout for opportunities. “In April they came and were very happy with the environment in Zimbabwe. So, one group has decided to build a smart city and this is the one we launched today. “It will have the tallest building in Africa with hotels, restaurants, apartments and it will be a state-of-the-art city, a city of the future,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629932" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We all know that we are going digital and this is going to be the first city in our region. I told them that I want a city better than Dubai because they are the people who built Dubai.  So, they are going to build a city that is equal or better than what they built in Dubai.” He said the investors have also undertaken to build state of the art medical services in Zimbabwe. “Beyond that they are also going to modernise Harare and Bulawayo and they were here in the country and took pictures. They are working on how they can uplift and upgrade our two cities.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629935" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Meanwhile, there is high expectation as President Mnangagwa is set to meet exhibitors at the Mine Entra with both local and foreign participants expressing excitement over the return of the expo after a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19. Exhibitors are convinced this year’s expo presents an enabling platform to network, create synergies and expand operations.
The silver jubilee edition runs under the theme: “Explore. Extract. Expand — Towards Sustainable Mining Value Chains” and ends tomorrow. President Mnangagwa is the guest of honour and is set to interact with the industry leaders and potential investors as well as deliver the keynote address during the official opening ceremony today. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629938" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/123.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/123.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/123-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The premier gathering of mining, engineering, transport and construction industry stakeholders provides a platform to engage in productive discussions for the creation of an enabling environment for the growth and development of the mining industry. A diverse range of products and services are being exhibited such as earth moving equipment, fire-fighting equipment, security systems, protective clothing, financial services and automotive engineering. Yesterday was a hive of activity as many exhibitors engaged in business to business meetings at various stands, an indication that firm business deals would be clinched.  Popular stands in terms of people flocking in included the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority pavilion, Fidelity Printers and Refiners, Pro Plastic, Redan, several laboratories, just to mention a few. In separate interviews, a cross-section of local and foreign participants said the exhibition theme feeds into their expectations and prospects of the sector. They said they have been able to reconnect with old clients and establish new links, which, if followed through, could strengthen their synergies. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629941" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-46.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-46.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-46-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nashy Mining Components marketing and sales officer, Mr Felix Simbi, said as a first-time exhibitor they have been overwhelmed with the number of inquiries for their services. “This is our first time to exhibit and it gives us exposure to the market. We are confident that it’s in line with the theme ‘Explore. Extract. Expand’ we will achieve that,” he said.  “We have been getting a lot of inquiries about our product offer. We do re-conditioning of engines for mining equipment and supply spares. “Judging by the high level of inquiries we have been getting, we are confident that our scope of business will be widened. We have firm business promises from several major mining firms, which are exhibiting here,” said Mr Simbi. A representative from a Bulawayo-based firm- Sultan Bolts, Ms Sithabile Tshuma, said they were inundated by inquiries for their various range of protective clothing, bearings and v-belts. “We had been looking forward to Mine Entra for a long time. We exhibited in 2019 and got good business exposure and then Covid-19 struck,” she said. “It’s a great opportunity to meet new clients and create opportunities for our growth. Mine Entra does provide that platform to connect with potential investors.   <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629905" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Already we have met people who are into shipping, so we can build on that contact and make it easy for us to bring our products from outside the country.” Scot-Mec Marketing and Sales officer, Mr Johan Chabata, said they manufacture protective clothing and high-energy food powders for miners and their key challenge is sourcing raw materials. He said during today’s interface with Government officials, they hope to get solutions on sourcing raw materials. “With the resumption of Mine Entra, we are looking forward to getting solutions on how we can procure raw materials locally. We import several components, therefore tomorrow (today) we hope to present our issues through relevant structures to relevant authorities,” said Mr Chabata who is exhibiting for the sixth time. Pump and Steel Supplies operations manager, Mr Solomon Mukombe, said the exhibition further cements their position and commitment to contributing to the growth of the mining sector.
