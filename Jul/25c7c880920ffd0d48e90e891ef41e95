PRESIDENT Mnangagwa is set to headline the country’s leading Mining, Engineering and Transport exhibition (Mine Entra) to be held in Bulawayo in the next few weeks. Commonly known as Mine Entra, the specialised exhibition, which returns after a two-year absence owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, will be held at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre between July 20 and 22.  The exhibition will run under the theme, “Explore, Extract, Expand: Towards Sustainable Mining Value Chains.” The premier gathering of mining, engineering, transport and construction industry stakeholders provides a platform to engage in productive discussions for the creation of an enabling environment for the growth and development of the mining industry. <img class="wp-image-614256 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Minister-Winston-Chitando.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Minister-Winston-Chitando.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Minister-Winston-Chitando-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Winston Chitando It also incorporates a display of mining equipment, chemicals and protective clothes as well as insurance and security services, which are needed by miners.

Dr Ndebele said in the past two weeks, the exhibition executive team has been engaged in a series of high-level stakeholder engagements in preparation for the Silver Jubilee edition of Mine Entra. He said they met Minister Chitando as well as other critical mining industry stakeholders where discussions revolved around formatting the exhibition in a manner that reflects the needs of the industry, as well as canvassing for support and participation. <img class="wp-image-599698 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Nicholas-Ndebele.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Nicholas-Ndebele.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Nicholas-Ndebele-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Nicholas Ndebele “We also visited selected foreign diplomatic missions based in Zimbabwe representing countries with thriving mining economies and or strong investor pool for the mining sector,” said Dr Ndebele. Some of the countries visited include Australia, Botswana, Canada, DRC, India, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Turkey and Zambia.” More engagements are planned for the coming weeks as officials want the exhibition to reflect the pivotal role that the extractive sector plays in Zimbabwe’s economy. The mining industry is one of Zimbabwe’s economic mainstays with the sector presently contributing about 70 percent of the country’s foreign currency earnings. <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay The Second Republic has come up with a mining industry roadmap whose target is to grow the sector to a US$12 billion industry by 2023 with the gold sector expected to generate US$4 billion, platinum US$3 billion and chrome, iron, steel, diamond and coal contributing US$1 billion. Lithium is expected to contribute US$500 million while other minerals will contribute US$1,5 billion. “To that end, we invite companies supplying exploration, extraction, processing or beneficiation machinery and training requirements for the mining sector as well as suppliers of equipment and machinery relating to the engineering and transport to exhibit,” said Dr Ndebele. <img class="wp-image-609763 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lithium The exhibition will have several knowledge-sharing platforms and focused dialogues catering for the different segments within the mining value-chain including small-to-medium scale mining as well as women and youth in mining. The forums are aimed at discussing ways to harness the country’s mining potential, identify markets for our minerals, improve mining operations to ensure sustainable exploration, extraction and processing of minerals to benefit citizens, said Dr Ndebele.
