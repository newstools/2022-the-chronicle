THE Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) has embraced a commercial business model dimension as part of its broad-based approach towards boosting revenue and self-sustenance in line with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). The thrust dovetails with the organisation’s “smart prison concept” driven by the fact that ZPCS is now correctional in outlook and business-oriented. <img class="wp-image-576611 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/GMB-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/GMB-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/GMB-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Already, ZPCS has embarked on several income-generating projects being undertaken at the country’s correctional and rehabilitation facilities. Anju Prison Farm in Matabeleland North province, for instance, is core to the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) drive to empower inmates with life skills, which they can use upon release from prison. The farm is one of the 23 ZPCS farms producing food for inmates at the different prisons across the country. The 203-hectare farm with an arable land of 130 hectares, is being utilised for the production of a wide range of horticultural produce, cereals and edible oil seeds.  Produce from the farm is used for feeding inmates at prisons in Matabeleland region while the surplus is sold to generate income to fund some of the day-to-day operations of the prisons. In his remarks during the 150th recruit correctional officers’ pass-out parade at Ntabazinduna Prison Training School on Monday, ZPCS Commissioner-General Moses Chihobvu, said in line with their new thrust more projects are on the cards. “I am glad to state that ZPCS is transforming its operational approach towards an entrepreneurial and business model dimension,” he said. <img class="wp-image-611026 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Edible oil seeds “In this regard, more income-generating projects are on the cards and with continued support, we are determined to reach self-sustenance and growth. “This will see ZPCS being able to produce enough to feed our prison population and surplus sold to GMB for income generation, hence contributing to the nation’s food security.” Comm-Gen Chihobvu said ZPCS is also positively contributing towards institutional development within the educational sector. <img class="wp-image-620839 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock “Our building brigades are impressively supporting in the construction and development of several schools. We are also delighted to say ZPCS through its building brigades has been recognised and will take part in Government-initiated programmes of constructing schools in Bulawayo, Harare, Mashonaland East and Manicaland provinces,” he said. Comm-Gen Chihobvu urged graduates to showcase their vocational skills and talents. At Khami Prison, ZPCS has adopted an enviable integrated farming model, which is providing supplementary feeding for about 4 000 inmates in Bulawayo Metropolitan Province’s five prisons. The 2 577-hectare farm has an arable land of 61 hectares, which is being utilised for the production of a wide range of horticultural produce, cotton and winter wheat under the Command Agriculture Scheme. A total of 2 102 hectares has been set aside for livestock production, which includes piggery, rabbitry, dairy and cattle ranching. Cabinet, in a recent meeting, commended the farming model at Khami Prison, saying it has proved to be viable and excellent in terms of providing supplementary feeding to prisoners. The farming model at the farm is now being replicated at other prisons across the country such as Chikurubi, Gwanda, Connemara and Plumtree prisons with notable progress. ZPCS has started harvesting grain and yet to deliver to the Grain Marketing Board (GMB). — @mashnets
