THE provincial Matabeleland North Annual Agricultural Show will be held in Hwange from 4 to 7 August with organisers saying about 80 percent of exhibition space has been taken up. <img class="alignnone wp-image-630256 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-251.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-251.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-251-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Whange Show Society chair, Mr Praise Moyo, said they were targeting 8 000 delegates this year, up from the more than 4 000 that attended last year. There is a significant interest from new exhibitors to the annual expo, which is a perfect platform for businesses to interact in Matabeleland North. Mr Moyo said cleaning of the show grounds at Number 2 was underway ahead of the start of the exhibition whose official opening has been set for August 6.  He said the guest of honour will be announced in due course as organisers are still waiting for a response from the targeted guests. “Preparations are at an advanced stage. The response has been good so far as we have engaged a number of new exhibitors who have paid to come and exhibit. In terms of occupancy, we are at 80 percent of the total space now,” said Mr Moyo. He said the show was an important platform for business. The theme for this year’s expo is: “Expediting value-addition to accelerate socio-economic growth.” <img class="wp-image-610168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-62-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-62-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-62-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Agriculture Matabeleland North has a diverse economy ranging from tourism to mining, agriculture, timber, fisheries and others. All these sectors can interact and share business ideas. “This is a perfect platform for business and organisations to converge and share ideas on how to benefit from what the province offers,” said Mr Moyo. The expo rebranded from Hwange Agricultural Show three years ago to match its status as Matabeleland North’s premier provincial exhibition. Over the years the expo has drawn exhibitors from Government departments, mining companies, tertiary institutions, small scale farmers and local authorities. The tourism industry has, however, been conspicuous by its absence despite being the province’s economic backbone. Entertainment activities lined up include a family fun day and jumping castles for children.–@ncubeleon
