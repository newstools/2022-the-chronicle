The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls NATIONAL carrier, Air Zimbabwe, has been urged to continue seeking partnerships to steer the success of its turnaround strategy as it aims at increasing the country’s connectivity and enable trade and investment. The airline is slowly gaining grip after being placed under reconstruction in 2018 to protect its assets and secure its operations. The process was concluded on 30 June 2021 as part of efforts to support the airline as a key asset and enabler for trade, investment and tourism.  The six-year Strategic Turnaround Plan is being implemented to propel the operations of Air Zimbabwe towards growth, sustainability and profitability. It is hinged on a number of key success factors including increased frequencies, convenient and affordable travel, development of a strong hub and network with Harare and Victoria Falls as the main and tourist hubs respectively. The strategy also entails re-joining of the IATA Clearing House and the Global Distribution System, which will ensure that Air Zimbabwe flights are sold globally. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister, Felix Mhona, in a speech read on his behalf by the director for strategic policy planning, Mr Allowance Sango, during a recent business event here said air transportation plays a critical role in transforming Zimbabwe into an upper middle-income economy by the year 2030. While legacy issues left the national airline at the brink of collapse, the Second Republic gave a new impetus by instituting measures, which seek to restore its historic glory, he said. <img class="wp-image-627799 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Allowance Sango “The growth of Air Zimbabwe facilitates the opening and connection to markets, trade and enables industries to link into global supply chains,” said the minister. “This entails activating possible partnerships for smaller equipment to service the full spectrum of airport network in Zimbabwe and successful implementation of the recovery plan.” According to the recovery strategy, Air Zimbabwe should have launched at least two regional routes before the end of 2022. <img class="wp-image-627796 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Tafadzwa Zaza Minister Mhona said robust Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provide opportunity to meet potential partners in aviation, sporting, tourism and hospitality industries. He commended Air Zimbabwe for showing social responsibility by donating proceeds from the tournament to charity. “It’s, however, common cause that these goals cannot be attained in isolation. They need to be buttressed with the support and engagement with your esteemed business partners, stakeholders and valued clients,” said Minister Mhona. <img class="wp-image-627793 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Winnie Muchanyuka “As a ministry, our vision is to be a regional hub for world-class transport networks, logistics and services by the year 2030 and, therefore, the successful revival of the national airline is a priority area.” The airline has stepped up to make its mark on the market through schedule flexibility as the market opens up for business, tourism and travel. Air Zimbabwe acting chief executive, Mr Tafadzwa Zaza, said the national airline was on a recovery and revival trajectory after the successful completion of a reconstruction process. “The Second Republic has committed to support this key national asset and we are certainly confident of a bright future for Air Zimbabwe going beyond sustainability to profitability. I would like to pledge and promise continuous engagement,” he said. ZTA chief executive, Ms Winnie Muchanyuka, said sport has potential to boost tourism by bringing corporates and individuals together, which can help grow numbers, improve hotel occupancies and flights into Victoria Falls. —@ncubeleon
