AN Emergency Power Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project funded by ZimFund has reached the last leg of implementation with the delivery of a 175MVA transformer, in Kwekwe, signalling relief from constant power outages. The giant transformer was delivered on Sunday at Sherwood Substation in the Midlands Province and is set to benefit more customers in the province as well as parts of Masvingo, Mashonaland East and West provinces, serving over 1,2 million people.  Phase II of the Emergency Power Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (EPIRP II) was funded to the tune of $22,74 million by ZimFund, in which the African Development Bank group is a major partner. “The substation is equipped with three 90MVA, 330/88/11kV transformers, giving a total substation installed capacity of 270MVA against a substation demand of 350MVA,” said ZimFund in a Press statement. <img class="wp-image-541069 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZETDC The new transformer will replace the old equipment, which is beyond repair, causing numerous power interruptions that have impacted negatively on households, industry, human capital institutions and essential basic service delivery. WSP Power managing director, Mr Dinesh Buldoo, representing the Government of Zimbabwe stated that the delivery of the transformer was a key milestone since it is the largest key equipment included in the project scope. “The project faced delays exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic impact especially on the production and shipping lines,” said Mr Buldoo. He thanked the Zimbabwe Electricity Distribution Company’s (ZETDC) and the people of Zimbabwe for their patience throughout the implementation of the project. The AfDB EPIRP Phase II was designed to improve the availability of electricity supply through rehabilitation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The project target areas were Kwekwe, Gweru, Bulawayo, Mutare, Harare and Hwange, with a combined target population of five million people. Commenting on the delivery of the transformer, ZETDC network development engineer, Edson Manyewe, said the project would result “in improved reliability of supplies, efficient operation of the network as well as improved quality of supplies.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-583172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZimFund has been one of the most instrumental programmes in the country in terms of restoring Zimbabwe’s critical infrastructure for power, water supply and sanitation especially in the targeted areas. By the end of the first phase of the power project I in 2016, more than 529 700 people in residential areas had their sewage reticulation serviced by reliable power, 11 600 others were restored to the electricity network and 11 100 people were added to the network. <img class="wp-image-627208 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kariba Dam Rehabilitation The $145,8 million fund’s donors include Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Most of the substations rehabilitated under ZimFund power project supply power to critical institutions such as hospitals, schools and universities, water and sewage treatment plants, mines and other public facilities that cater for a population of over five million people, spread across the country’s provinces. Under its energy sector, the AfDB is also financing other infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe such as the Kariba Dam Rehabilitation, Alaska-Karoi Transmission Line and Energy Sector Reform Support projects with a total investment of US$90,5 million.
