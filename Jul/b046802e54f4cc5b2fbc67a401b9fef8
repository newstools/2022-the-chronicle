The Chronicle SERENA Williams will continue her comeback at next month’s Canadian Open WTA event in Toronto, organisers confirmed yesterday. The former world No 1, who played her first singles match in a year during a first round defeat at Wimbledon last month, was named in a star-studded field for the 6-14 August tournament. <img class="wp-image-627988 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-57-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-57-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-57-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Iga Swiatek Williams, who is using her protected ranking to enter the main draw, joins a field which includes 41 of the top 43-ranked players in the world, including two-time Roland Garros champion and world No 1 Iga Swiatek. Williams was beaten in three sets by unseeded Frenchwoman Harmony Tan at Wimbledon last month. Asked afterwards about her plans for the future, Williams, who turns 41 later this year, was coy. “Who knows where I’ll pop up?” she told reporters. <img class="wp-image-627985 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-56-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-56-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-56-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Roland Garros Naomi Osaka, Coco Gauff, and US Open champion Emma Raducanu are also in the stacked field for the tournament in Toronto. The men’s tournament, which will take place in Montreal, will see Rafael Nadal make his return after an injury cut short his Wimbledon campaign.  Nadal has won five times in Canada and will be out to equal Ivan Lendl’s record of six Canadian Open titles. The field also includes world No 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas, Casper Ruud and Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz in addition to world No 1 Daniil Medvedev. — SuperSport
