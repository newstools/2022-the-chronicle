That’s why I worked with these fresh, talented artistes.  “The track is about Matabeleland talent being put up there with the best. It shows that we have the muscle to make things happen and prosper,” he said. Madlela paid homage to those who worked with him on the production of the video. “I’d like to appreciate Western Khazins for being part of the video as they brought a spark as well as appreciate Mqaliwendaba who has been working with us for years in shooting these videos,” he said. — @mthabisi_mthire
