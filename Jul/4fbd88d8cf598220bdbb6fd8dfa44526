Mr Kakubo said President Hichilema remained firmly committed to ensuring that Zambia remained an active member of the AU and a key partner in furthering the continental development agenda. “The President has continued to underscore the importance of promoting intra-African trade and collaboration for beneficial economic and social development of the continent. To this end, this summit will allow Zambia to build further on its solid foundation of cooperation with countries on the continent based on a shared history and values, respect for the rule of law,” he said. So far, expectations are high as Zambia makes final touches to host the two important continental gatherings.

TCZ Chief Executive Officer Victor Inambwae said in Lusaka that the AU gatherings would have a multiplier effect to enlisted official hotels, transport sector, and farmers who supply various food products to hotels, among others. “Zambia has excellent conference facilities to host the AU meetings. For us in the tourism and hospitality sector, we are direct beneficiaries because our members, who are operators, will be housing these delegates,” he said. On July 7, 2022, Information and Media Minister Chushi Kasanda officiated at a media workshop in readiness for the continental gatherings. Ms Kasanda said Zambia was privileged to host the meeting which had attracted about 13 foreign Heads of State and Government from across the continent and 51 Ministers of Foreign Affairs out of 55 member states. “The media workshop is important because the media will play a crucial role in keeping our citizens and the world at large, informed about the meeting. It is our hope, as Government, that our people will benefit in terms of information on what their leaders will be deliberating on during the period of the meeting. God bless our great nation,” Ms Kasanda said on her Facebook page.
