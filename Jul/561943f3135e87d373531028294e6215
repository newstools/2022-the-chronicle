BINGA Rural District Council (RDC) has handed over its major roads to Government as it is struggling to hire external contractors to work on the roads. The local authority says it has handed over its major roads that need to be rehabilitated to the District Development Fund (DDF). In April, President Mnangagwa directed ministries to swiftly implement all pending infrastructure projects in the district that include rehabilitation of roads, construction of a vocational training centre and a new border post, borehole drilling, setting up of a nursing school at Binga Hospital and refurbishment and operationalisation of the hospital mortuary. <img class="size-full wp-image-620620" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-393.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-393.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-393-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa In an interview, the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet responsible for DDF, Mr Christopher Shumba said his department has heeded the President’s call to rehabilitate Binga roads. “At the moment we have dedicated a grader, dozer and drilling rig to Binga and they are doing well there. We are supporting them as much as we can so that we cover as much of the road network as possible. Over and above, Binga RDC has decided to handover all their roads to DDF so we are working on council roads as well,” said Mr Shumba. He said companies contracted by DDF to work on its roads, will also work on council roads. Mr Shumba said DDF is also rehabilitating roads leading to chiefs’ homesteads, schools and clinics.  “We are also working with the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) to drill boreholes,” he said. Government mandated Zinwa to drill 35 000 boreholes across the country. “We are also working on dams but Zinwa dams are bigger than ours. We work on smaller dams which basically supply water to small irrigation schemes and these are spread across the country,” said Mr Shumba.
