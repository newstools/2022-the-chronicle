A MAJOR pump breakdown has triggered a water crisis in the provincial capital of Matabeleland South, Gwanda. Disgruntled residents have gone for three days without water, forcing many to resort to borehole water. <img class="wp-image-625021 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) The development comes barely a week after the local authority took over the water management system from the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa). In a statement yesterday, Gwanda Municipality confirmed the water pump system breakdown at the main treatment plant and said its teams were seized with the matter in a bid to restore normal supplies. “The Municipality of Gwanda would like to apologise for disruption in water supplies for the whole of Gwanda town. “This is due to the breakdown of the low lift pump at the water treatment plant. Efforts are underway to restore water supplies,” said the council.  In separate interviews, residents said the municipality should provide water through bowsers to augment supplies. “We have not had water here in Spitzkop North Extension for some days and this is making our lives very difficult,” fumed one of the residents, Ms Ntando Moyo. “We are appealing to the council to provide us with water through bowsers in the interim because the few boreholes in our area are not enough for the whole community.” <img class="wp-image-620116 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-71-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-71-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-71-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Boreholes Another resident who preferred anonymity said council should going forward, come up with mitigatory measures that will save residents from possible disease outbreaks. “In fact, the council should be able to explain to residents their challenges in time rather than keeping us in the dark until we have a bigger crisis,” said the resident. Just last week, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka, presided over the historic hand-over ceremony of water treatment plants and water affairs to Beitbridge and Gwanda Municipalities in line with the Second Republic’s devolution agenda.
