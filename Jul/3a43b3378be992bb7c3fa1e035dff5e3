Chronicle Showbiz spoke to nightclub DJs from Bulawayo who expressed gratitude at meeting the late Mellow T. DJ Prince Eskhosini said he was happy to have met Mellow T, a DJ whom he looked up to before he passed on. “Everyone has their hero in any industry and DJ Mellow T was someone I looked up to. I didn’t need to be close friends with Mellow T for him to teach or inspire me. He was the king of the decks. “He was a quiet guy and I was very shy to approach him initially. I remember in the early 2000s when I was slowly getting into the club scene, he was one of those guys I learnt from while watching from a distance. That’s how good he was. <img class="wp-image-630163 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-244.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-244.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-244-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late DJ Mellow T on decks at a L’vovo Derrango show back in the day. We lost a legend,” said Prince Eskhosini. DJ Mellow T’s friend and associate, DJ Kead Wikead said more than 25 DJs will play at the event. “On Saturday, we’ll have more than 25 club DJs alternating on the decks to honour our legend. After every 30 minutes, we’ll be changing DJs who’ll be playing different genres.  “We’ll celebrate one of the pioneers of the game the only way we know how so I urge people to pull up in their numbers in support,” said DJ Kead Wikead. Every club DJ has a Mellow T story and Bulawayo’s Ndebele Rockstar Babongile Skhonjwa is no exception. “It’s sad that I only got to know that I was related to Mellow T after he died. The first time that I met him was when I was the entertainment manager at Visions. He played an RnB set which won him a resident DJ spot at the establishment. “He was a very serious guy. Even on the decks, he wouldn’t smile, but when he laughed, he would blow the roof off any building. It was abrupt and short but powerful. After that, it would be business as usual. “I worked with him a lot at Kudu Bar and Zarah Lounge among other places and he was the first club DJ to have a CD bag. I still have one with his handwriting at home,” said Skhonjwa. – @eMKlass_49
