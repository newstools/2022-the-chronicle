Listing prices reflect how the suppliers of real estate read the market and policy direction,” said Mr Mombechena. He said the performance of the economy and policy direction has affected capacity to deliver on the objectives of the department and real estate players in general. “The department, however, responds to this in a positive way by developing new solution lines like diaspora mortgages, USD mortgages for targeted clients in the market. “The solution lines include outright purchase, building finance, property improvements and equity release,” said Mr Mombechena.
