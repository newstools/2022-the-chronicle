He believes he would be playing in the topflight league or even better had it not been for Covid-19. “I really feel the two years under Covid-19 restrictions moved me back a lot. “Football is a very short profession and age is a key component to everything. I am 20 as it is but imagine what l lost in the two years. “I believe l could have been playing in the Castle Lager Premiership or somewhere abroad. “I am enjoying my football as it stands but l still believe it could have been better,” says Marozhe. Born December 2022, Marozhe started his football career at primary school. “I attended Zulukandaba Primary School in Entumbane. I started playing football at the age of 10 years when I was doing Grade Four. “I then proceeded to Pamushana High School in Masvingo for my secondary education. “From there I grew a passion for football. I believe my brother Tafadzwa had a role in my love for the game specifically in high school as he was my senior at the same school and also playing football. <img class="wp-image-629578 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-235.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-235.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-235-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Copa Coca-Cola trophy “In 2018, we won the Copa Coca-Cola trophy at Mandava Stadium, defeating Guinea Fowl High School from Gweru 2-0. I was the team captain at that time,” Marozhe. Having played successfully at primary and secondary school, Marozhe decided to take his career a step further. “After my Ordinary Level, I joined Asande Sana Academy from Matshobana suburb. Then later joined Quality Foods fc where I’m playing now,” said Marozhe. He says his parents have been inspirational by supporting his football dream.  “My parents motivate me a lot. I feel good whenever I see them coming to watch me playing. My father is even trying to connect me with some international leagues like Bundesliga. “I have even started learning German as part of my preparations in case I strike a chance of going there as my father’s wish. “My dream is to play overseas and probably invest in businesses and plough back to the community. Marozhe also paid tribute to his coach Loverty Mabunda. “I am grateful to Mabunda for the faith he has shown in me. “I would rate my performance this season myself at about 60 percent because l feel l can do more to help the club,” said Marozhe.
