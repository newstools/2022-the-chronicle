Material is coming in timeously and if it continues like this, we are assured that this building will be completed by early next year,” said Mr Dube. The double storey building will have 110 rooms including lecture rooms, moot courts and offices. Mr Dube said the construction started on May 3 and he was satisfied with the pace. “I am glad that most of our workers are on site. Almost 80 percent of them, are women. Probably that is why we are moving so fast. We have managed to do landfilling on the better part and brick works have started in most sections of the structure. With the pace at which we are moving and if material continues pouring in, by early 2023 we will be done,” he said. About 239 workers are on site with about 170 being women.  Executive Dean Faculty of Law, Dr Gift Manyathela said if completed, the campus is expected to become one of the best in the region. “This is a tremendous project and we are grateful to the Government for such a state-of-the-art school of law which we want to grow into a centre of excellence in offering legal education in the region,” said Dr Manyathela. He expressed satisfaction with the work being done on site. “Imagine they only started work on May 3 and in only two and a half months they have made so much progress. This is really commendable and we are looking forward to seeing that by early next year they will have completed the first structure,” he said. Kwekwe District Development Coordinator Mr Fortune Mpungu said the university will bring development to Kwekwe. “This project will bring development to Kwekwe as more supporting infrastructure like shopping malls and houses to accommodate the students will have to be constructed. I challenge Kwekwe City and Zibagwe Rural Council to be ready for the campus,” said Mr Mpungu. <img class="size-full wp-image-504029" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/B79DC21B-C849-4D7E-9A4A-FDBBC0734C29.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/B79DC21B-C849-4D7E-9A4A-FDBBC0734C29.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/B79DC21B-C849-4D7E-9A4A-FDBBC0734C29-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Lucia Mnkandla Kwekwe Town Clerk, Dr Lucia Mnkandla echoed the sentiments saying the project would attract a lot of investors. “We are so excited with the project as it will speed up development in the city.
