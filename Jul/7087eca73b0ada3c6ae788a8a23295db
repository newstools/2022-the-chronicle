FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza has urged his players to be humble and keep their feet on the ground despite opening a five-point gap at the top of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League table. The Zvishavane side is enjoying a good run and has won its last seven matches without conceding a goal, while banging in 15 goals and collecting 21 points. <img class="wp-image-621910 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dynamos The side is proving to be a dominating force in local football after winning the last three consecutive titles and is now gunning for a fourth championship to join Highlanders and Dynamos, the only other teams to achieve that feat. Despite topping the table, Mapeza refuses to be drawn into the prospects of a fourth consecutive title, insisting that they are still on a rebuilding exercise, which started at the beginning of the season, and wants his boys to enjoy their games. Last weekend, FC Platinum put up a championship winning performance by edging Bulawayo Chiefs 1-0 through a late Lawrence Mhlanga strike in the 88th minute.  That ability to get goals out of nothing and their resilience to fight to the last whistle is a mark of champions. Their pedigree will be tested on Sunday when they travel to Harare to face Dynamos, who have gone for three matches without a win. Dynamos started off showing a lot of promise, but as the season progressed, their form dipped and they slipped from the top and are now third with 35 points, eight behind FC Platinum. Mapeza understands the magnitude of the game, but he is not exerting pressure on his charges, saying he wants them to freely express themselves on the field of play. “I always tell my players to be humble; let’s keep our feet on the ground, keep working hard and take each game as it comes,” Mapeza said. One player who has been in top form during the platinum miners’ good run is goalkeeper Wallace Magalane, who has kept seven consecutive clean sheets since being thrown into the fray in April. <img class="wp-image-481005 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Wallace-Magalane.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Wallace-Magalane.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Wallace-Magalane-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wallace Magalane Magalane has ably filled the number one spot in the absence of the injured and experienced Petros Mhari, who will need to work hard to reclaim his starting place. Mhlanga has also been good in central defence, partnering Gift Bello, while Nomore Chinyere and Gift Mbweti do shifts as wing backs. Their midfield has been solid, assisting in defence and also initiating attacks as well as creating scoring opportunities. Brian Banda has been outstanding in the midfield for FC Platinum alongside winger Walter Musona, Ransome Pavari and Juan Mutudza, with Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya keeping opposition defenders on their toes. <img class="wp-image-604738 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-9-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-9-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-9-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tonderai Ndiraya With Mapeza’s mean-machine hungry for more points, Dynamos coach Tonderai Ndiraya, who admitted to mounting pressure, will look to the experience of goalkeeper Taimon Mvula, defenders Patson Jaure, Sylvester Appiah, Frank Makarati, Godknows Murwira and Brendon Mpofu to protect his goal. Shadreck Nyahwa, King Nadolo, Keith Murera and Bill Antonio will want to be counted in midfield, while Evans Katema leads their strikeforce with Emmanuel Paga.
