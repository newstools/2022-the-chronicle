AS the world transitions to clean energy and renewable sources of power, there is a growing need for insurers who understand the risks inherent in this transition. Climate change is creating new challenges for the insurance industry that are complicated by the fact that many companies in this sector have been slow to acknowledge and act on climate risk. <img class="wp-image-612303 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> climate change As a result, there is ample opportunity for those who can see beyond today’s risks and opportunities. The insurance industry must also adjust its strategies to continue serving customers as the energy industry changes. What does this mean for energy insurance companies? The theme of the recent African Insurance Organisation conference and general assembly in Kenya was: “Insurance and Climate Change: Harnessing the Opportunities for Growth in Africa”. This is a clear statement that the insurance industry particularly in Africa has begun to think of the opportunities climate change presents. The impact of renewable energy on the insurance industry As the energy sector makes the transition to clean energy, the insurance industry will be impacted in multiple ways. First, it will be important to understand the exposure that insurance companies face as the sector shifts away from traditional sources of power. Insurers will need to be aware of new risks to their business as the industry makes this change. They will also need to adapt their strategies to continue serving customers, given the shifting priorities that may result from this transition. Second, insurers will have an opportunity to help shape the shift to clean energy. Insurers have a great deal of expertise in evaluating and managing risk, which they can use to help transition the industry away from high-carbon sources of power toward clean energy sources. <img class="wp-image-625516 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> energy sources To do this, insurers will need to understand the risks posed by various clean energy sources and other aspects of the transition. This will allow them to help the industry take steps towards more responsible practices. The risks of a transition to clean energy As the world moves towards clean energy, we must be aware of the risks that this transition poses. While the shift towards clean energy is necessary to address the risks posed by climate change, it also poses risks in its own right. There are several areas where insurers will need to be aware of risks as the industry makes this transition. First, insurers will need to understand and account for the risk of extreme weather events caused by climate change, something, which I believe many insurers the world over have already begun doing. They will also need to keep track of the changing risk of natural disasters. Insurers will also need to account for additional risks posed by the transmission of electricity and the upkeep of various energy sources and infrastructure. Finally, insurers will need to take into account the risk of cyber attacks on energy infrastructure. <img class="alignnone wp-image-625519 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-52.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-52.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-52-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Protecting against these risks will be important to help the transition to clean energy be successful. Insurers can help define responsible practices in clean-tech As the insurance industry becomes more aware of the risks posed by a transition to clean energy, they will have an opportunity to help shape responsible practices in the energy industry. Insurers can play a critical role in helping clean energy transition and be as responsible as possible towards both the environment and society at large. To do this, insurers will need to have a deep understanding of clean energy sources. This will allow them to identify ways to reduce risk and make clean energy practices more responsible. There are a number of ways that insurers can help with this. They can: – Conduct research and advocate for research into responsible practices in clean energy. -Define and describe the types of risks specific to clean energy. – Develop new insurance products and services that correspond to clean energy practices. – Integrate climate risk into their underwriting and risk assessment practices  Bottom line: climate change is creating new risks for insurers. Insurers need to be aware of the new risks that climate change will pose to the energy industry. This will help them be prepared to respond to the changing landscape. To do this, insurers must understand the risks posed by clean energy sources. This will allow them to help the energy industry transition towards more responsible practices. Overall, this will be important to help the shift to clean energy be successful and beneficial for both the industry and society at large. -Taurai Craig Museka is an insurance professional and blogger.
