The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwe Cross Border Traders Association (ZCBTA) has appealed to the Government for land to enable its members to build proper business premises that they can use as collateral in accessing loans. ZCBTA is a non-governmental organisation that represents the interests of cross-border traders in Zimbabwe. It was formed in 2000 and has over 7 000 members. <img class="wp-image-618580 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/ba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/ba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/ba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> BancABC The association’s president, Mr Killer Zivhu made the plea to Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube last week. “As cross borders, we are asking you to forward our plea to President Mnangagwa. Our members require land to build properties which they will in turn use as collateral,” he said. <img class="wp-image-626458 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-48-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-48-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-48-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa In May the association leadership expressed frustration over failure by local authorities to avail adequate land for informal traders to operate from saying this was crippling the sector’s viability and growth. They appealed to the Government to intervene in ensuring that councils avail land for traders. During a meeting last week, Minister Ncube acknowledged the need for cross border traders to own business and residential properties and pledged to engage relevant authorities . <img class="wp-image-624631 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-51.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-51.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-51-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Killer Zivhu “Bulawayo city is now at the centre of other growing districts such as Umguza.  To acquire land for the cross border traders we need to negotiate with them. Denver Farm is one of the options we have.  The executive should verify that maybe we can get some stands there,” said Minister Ncube. In 2012 ZCBTA and BancABC entered into a housing partnership that entailed cross border traders opening individual property accounts with the bank to raise capital for housing projects in Bulawayo. The bank indicated then that the accounts would accrue a seven percent interest annually.
