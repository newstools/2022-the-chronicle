The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter THE Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) has started conducting counter investigations in the 22 cases of unexplained wealth involving externalisation of over US$22 million after four of the accused respondents wrote affidavits trying to justify their source of wealth. The National Prosecuting Authority also said six of the dockets needed further inquiries while 12 are with the NPA awaiting submission.

In December 2018, President Mnangagwa announced a three months moratorium for individuals and corporates who had externalised money to return the stash with no questions asked and $591,1 million was recovered from the $1,4 billion which was externalised leaving an outstanding figure of $826,5 million. President warned those who failed to heed the call to return the money that they faced prosecution and in March 2018, he named and shamed corporates and individuals who had ignored the olive branch. The list had 1 844 externalisers with most of the looters in mining, agriculture, manufacturing and cross-border freight. <img class="size-full wp-image-617653" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/makarume-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/makarume-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/makarume-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr John Makamure About 157 individuals and companies externalised $464 204 171, banking the cash in foreign banks while others made bogus transactions with most of the money going to China, Botswana and South Africa.
