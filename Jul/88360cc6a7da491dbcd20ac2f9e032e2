The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso has ruled out any additions to his squad in the current mid-season transfer window, insisting that he is content with his players. <img class="wp-image-464133 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Obriel-Chirinda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Obriel-Chirinda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Obriel-Chirinda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obriel Chirinda Chiefs spent big in the first transfer window, bringing in Obriel Chirinda, Kevin Madzongwe, Perfect Chikwende, Obadiah Tarumbwa and Kevin Moyo, but Terroso says no one will join the Ninjas between now and closure of the window on July 31. “I am not interested in anyone. Are we looking at anyone or any specific positions we would want to fill; my answer is no. At this moment in time I am happy with my team. I can’t say no one will come and no one will get out because someone can come in and get our players. That is the nature of the game and it’s as simple as that. What I can say and what I can assure you is that the team we have will do the service,” Terroso said. <img class="wp-image-416872 size-article-featured-image" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/obadiah-tarumbwa-red-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/obadiah-tarumbwa-red-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/obadiah-tarumbwa-red-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obidiah Tarumbwa “I still believe we have players individually and collectively that will continue to improve. I think we have reached a stage where the underlying philosophy of how we play is there and I think it’s now a question of developing and progressing. This is not about pressure; we are not going out there to get players because we want to finish in a particular position.” Chiefs face Cranborne Bullets at Luveve Stadium tomorrow hoping to extend their unbeaten run to 10 games. In their last nine matches, Chiefs have managed five draws and four victories, and they are in 10th place on the table with 26 points. <img class="wp-image-529754 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Kevin-Moyo-in-Nkana-colours.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Kevin-Moyo-in-Nkana-colours.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Kevin-Moyo-in-Nkana-colours-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kevin Moyo “We played them before Christmas and they were in good form. They were doing well in the league and Chibuku Super Cup. Since then, some players have left and there has been a little bit of change, but I believe they are going to be quite direct and dynamic.  “They will probably look to capitalise on our mistakes, but we have prepared for them with the rest of my technical staff. I don’t believe in easy games because this league has shown that the competitiveness levels are quite high,” said Terroso. — @innocentskizoe
