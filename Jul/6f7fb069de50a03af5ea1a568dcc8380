Livestock farmers here have ventured into fodder production as a way of minimising the effects of successive droughts which have seen over 10 000 cattle succumbing to hunger in the last three years. So far 2 500 communal farmers within six communal wards in Beitbridge have been assisted with fodder seed by Government under the Enhanced Resilience for Vulnerable Households in Zimbabwe (ERVHIZ). <img class="wp-image-629599 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-237.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-237.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-237-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Hendrick Mbedzi The program is being implemented with the assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and other partners.
ERVHIZ Beitbridge coordinator, Mr Lovemore Mujere said the project was introduced in the district in November last year and that there has been a good uptake by the farmers. <img class="wp-image-625804 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) He was speaking during a field day held by the Fharanani Fodder Group in Ward 11 in the Bwemula area of Beitbridge West. The farmers have produced 350 bales of velvet and lab-lab beans (proteins) which they are selling at R80 each to other farmers. They have also baled stover from maize, and sorghum which they serve as carbohydrates. “We trained them on and preparations, harvesting and gave them the seed for legumes and the skills to make liquid fertilisers. We are happy with the progress here and the general uptake of the program is encouraging,” he said. The district Agritex officer, Mr Masauso Mawocha said so far farmers across the district had planted fodder crops on 350 hectares. He said they were targeting to plant on 1 000 hectares to have enough supplies to save the livestock. The official said the fodder crops were being used as a supplement to maintain the body mass of livestock when grazing lands start to deplete. “In some instances, the farmers can feed cattle to boost their market value,” said Mr Mawocha. “It is also important to note that the production of fodder crops is seamless as compared to the other foods supplements the farmers have been struggling to buy from retail shops.  “In our view this is a smart way of adapting to the effects of climate change by the farmers, considering that we are coming from three successive droughts where the farmers in this area lost over 10 000 herds of cattle due to poverty-related deaths.” He said Government along with a number of partners was rolling out the fodder project where farmers have embraced the program. Mr Mawocha said bales of fodder, if properly stored, can last for several months. He added that previously only one commercial farmer was producing Lucerne as a supplement for livestock but that was not enough for the district. “To date, we have more than 350 hectares of fodder production and we are seeing this increasing to over 1 000 hectares in the next three years. “This fodder production we are producing is basically proteins that are not needed in large quantities. So if we have at least 1 000 hectares, we will be on the safe zone,” said Mr Mawocha. A livestock farmer from Bwemula area, Mr Hendricks Mbedzi said the introduction of legumes and other supplementary feeds which required fewer inputs was a boost to their restocking exercise. He said many people were still recovering from the devastating loss of cattle and hence the uptake of fodder production was gradually peaking. <img class="wp-image-620440 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-372.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-372.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-372-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Agritex “With this kind of crop you just need inputs and the correct technical advice from Agritex extension workers,” he said. Mrs Rudzani Siziba of Chabeta area said they were grateful for the help they were getting from Government to save their animals. She said besides saving livestock from hunger, the sale of the fodder bales was improving their alternative revenue streams at household level. “We sat down as a community and decided to form a group to find ways to save our livestock from successive droughts and hence we are now planting legumes to boost supplementary stock feeds,” said Mr Pilate Siyoka Muleya. Ward 11 Community Based Facilitator, Mrs Priscilla Ndou said they were benefiting a lot from the use of homemade liquid fertiliser which had been introduced in the area under the Smart Agriculture Technologies (SAT). —@tupeyo
