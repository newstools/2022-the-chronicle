The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief VILLAGERS in Manama, Gwanda District, say renovations at Manama Mission Hospital where infrastructure and buildings were extensively damaged by a violent storm late last year have stalled for long and urged authorities to move with speed to get the hospital running again. In January, the roof was completed with expectations of putting up the ceilings, electricals, painting, flooring, plumbing and other repairs but work has since stopped with officials citing unavailability of funds to complete the project. Government allocated $28 million for repairs and upgrading of Manama Hospital after noting that all the institution’s infrastructure does not meet modern health care standards. <img class="size-full wp-image-539612" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Dr-Omphile-Marupi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Dr-Omphile-Marupi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Dr-Omphile-Marupi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Omphile Marupi Media personality Dr Omphile Marupi, who was born at the hospital, co-ordinated a fundraising drive under the banner of Friends of Manama last year to help repair the health facility. Friends of Manama brought together teachers, academics, businesspeople, politicians, service chiefs and ordinary people associated with the hospital in one way or the other. Roofs of several wards that include the maternity ward were blown off following heavy rains accompanied by strong winds. “The project started off very well and we were optimistic that repairs would be completed in good time but it has dragged on for too long,” said Ms Reakebetswe Dube from Manama. She said there was a need for authorities to speed up the process as delays were affecting patients. “As it is, patients are having to squeeze into the available space which is not good. They require privacy and their own space to recover well,” said Ms Dube. Another villager from Manama, Mr Japhet Ndlovu said the restoration of the hospital to its full capacity would take it back to its glory days. <img class="size-full wp-image-614127" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gwanda Provincial Hospital. “This is one of the biggest hospitals here and we need to see it working as usual again. A lot of people need the services that were provided at the hospital. Some find themselves having to travel all the way to Gwanda Provincial Hospital, some 100km away, for assistance,” said Mr Ndlovu. The infrastructure damage at the hospital is estimated at US$40 000. Treasury initially released $8 million to repair the damaged infrastructure but later availed more funds to upgrade the entire hospital infrastructure, which is in a poor state. Matabeleland South Provincial Public Works director Mr Sijabuliso Ncube said unavailability of funds had resulted in the stalling of the project. “There hasn’t been much progress in the last few months except that we recently got a few building materials. Progress has stalled due to the unavailability of funds to buy building materials,” said Mr Ncube. <img class="size-full wp-image-558160" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Sijabuliso-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Sijabuliso-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Sijabuliso-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland South Provincial Public Works Director Mr Sijabuliso Ncube He called on various stakeholders to assist in bringing the project to completion through funding. “We’re waiting on the Government and any other well-wishers to chip in so that we can finish the work required,” said Mr Ncube. Strong winds and heavy rains which hit the Manama area, also left the hospital without electricity after solar panels were damaged, affecting water storage tanks and telecommunication cables, resulting in the suspension of critical services. The suspended services include the expanded programme of immunisation (EPI), maternity delivery services, postnatal care services, isolation of Covid-19-positive mothers, antenatal care services and integrated management of neonatal, childhood illnesses and mortuary services.  Four departments were extremely affected leaving the hospital operating with just four wards, which accommodate all the admitted patients. Dr Marupi said efforts were being made to raise more funds to see the completion of renovations at Manama Hospital. “We’re continuing to engage Friends of Manama to support the rebuilding of the hospital. The challenge has been the state of the economy that has made people redirect their efforts into their family projects. We’re also engaging the Church to see how best it can move the agenda, noting that we’ve got the Government of the day at the top and have the Church as the owner of the institution. In some way, the people are also the owners hence the formation of the Friends of Manama initiative from the triple P stance of the public-private partnership approach as emphasised under the new dispensation,” said Dr Marupi. <img class="size-full wp-image-575099" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Bishop-Michael-Dube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Bishop-Michael-Dube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Bishop-Michael-Dube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bishop Michael Dube “We’re supposed to have a meeting with the Bishop (Michael Dube) to map the way forward.” Manama Mission Hospital was built in 1939 by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe (ELCZ) using farm bricks and its roofing was a combination of corrugated iron and asbestos. It is located 85km south of Gwanda town and has a catchment population of 82 500 based on the 1992 census. The hospital mainly serves the population of Gwanda South and Beitbridge West. It also acts as a referral hospital for other parts of Beitbridge District, Maphisa, Kezi, parts of Mberengwa and Botswana. — @Yolisswa
