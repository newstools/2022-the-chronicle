CENTRAL Region Soccer League (CRSL) leaders and championship favourites Sheasham FC’s 21-game unbeaten run is testament to the quality the ambitious Gweru side has, coach John Nyikadzino says. Sheasham, the only team yet to taste defeat in the league, are unbeaten after 21 games and top the table with 49 points, seven ahead of second-placed former Premiership side TelOne. The ambitious Midlands club needs nine points to reach an unassailable 58 points. Nyikadzino heaped praise on his charges for the good form they are enjoying. “Our progression isn’t a fluke, it’s testimony of the amount of hard work that everyone in the team is putting in. The quality of players in our squad is amazing and when competition is at this stage, experience comes in handy.  “I’m not chasing the 2013 23-match unbeaten run I had with Chapungu, but what I want is for my boys to take each game as it comes, as we enter the final stages of the title race. We can’t afford to blink,” said Nyikadzino. Some of the experienced players leading Sheasham’s Premiership charge include veteran goalkeeper Liberty Chirava, former national Under-20 midfielder Pride Ziwengwa, ex-Bantu Rovers defender David Mangezi, utility player Tatenda Mapiye and former Chicken Inn winger Physwell Madhazi. Sheasham face a tricky away encounter tomorrow against ZPC Munyati, who they edged 1-0 in the reverse leg. <img class="wp-image-586489 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/kwekwe-united.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/kwekwe-united.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/kwekwe-united-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kwekwe United They will then face Kwekwe United at home, a side that held them 1-1 in the first-leg, and then travel to armyside Tongogara, who they edged 1-0 in Gweru, followed by two away matches against MSU and Loss Control.
