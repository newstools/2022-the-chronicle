The choir’s director, Trevor Mawaka, told Chronicle Showbiz that the opportunity presented to them will push their craft nationally. “This will be our first time out of the city and it gives us the opportunity to share our music with a whole new crowd. The children are set to mix and mingle with other creative children who push their art as well,” Mawaka said. He said the choir will tweak Zex Manatsa’s popular song since it is mandatory for all musical groups to do a rendition of any of the late superstar’s songs. <img class="size-full wp-image-582040" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/choir-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/choir-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/choir-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Charleston Trust Choir “We’ll perform a reimagined version of Tea Hobvu which we named, Nekapolony. It’s a great, unique refix of the old classic and I’m sure that festival-goers will be wowed by that one.” The choir last performed at the Africa Day Celebrations at Methodist High School in Bulawayo and welcomes the chance to perform outside the city. Complementary to the festival will be a Carnival Float and Procession plus a 5km and 10km Fun Run to Let Them Trust Village. The village is located seven kilometres from the late socialite, Ginimbi’s famous house in Domboshava.  The festival will be marked by live music performances with the Dance and Visual Arts theme being Tambai (dance). The drama and poetry theme will be Child Trafficking. Children will participate through their schools or as independent acts and up-and-coming artistes not in schools will take part. Charleston choir will also use the platform to premiere their new single titled Son of Africa. – @eMKlass_49
