The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TENAX SC who visit Bulawayo on Sunday for a battle with Highlanders FC at Barbourfields Stadium, have reportedly parted ways with head coach Shadreck Magurasawe. Magurasawe is said to have resigned from his post on Thursday. It is believed Magurasawe was angered by the club’s decision to return Blessing Madombi to the team’s technical department. <img class="wp-image-599866 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Barbourfields Stadium The team has however been recording a string of poor results. Madombi was axed by the club a few months ago for disciplinary reasons before the club reinstated him last week. The decision did not go well with Magurasawe who has since decided to quit. Tenax spokesperson, Philemon Mushekwa yesterday said he was yet to learn of Mugurasawe’s resignation. “l am not yet informed about that issue. What I know is the reinstatement of the assistant coach Blessing Madombi,” said Mushekwa.  Mugurasawe leaves after having lost five of their last six matches and the team is second from bottom on the table. It’s been a dramatic week for premier league teams. Three coaches have left their sides this week alone. Benjani Mwaruwari was the first to be shown the exit door at Ngezi Platinum Stars on Monday. <img class="wp-image-598396 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benjani Mwaruwari The former Warriors captain had been under pressure after failing to put on convincing performances since his appointment in March. Herbert Maruwa was also fired by Black Rhinos on Wednesday for what the club called “unbecoming behaviour during match days which has tainted the corporate image of the club and organisation at large.” — @innocentskizoe
