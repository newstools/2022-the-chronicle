FORM Two pupils at Errymaple High School in Zvishavane have started producing a toilet disinfectant that destroys bacteria. <img class="alignnone wp-image-626161 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This is one of the fruits of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education’s decision to embark on a comprehensive curriculum reform process which is meant to enhance the quality of education in Zimbabwe. A new competence-based curriculum framework was developed and finalised in 2015 and its phased implementation commenced in 2017. Several innovations were introduced in the new curriculum with broad implications for stakeholders at all levels. The competence-based curriculum seeks to motivate learners to cherish their Zimbabwean identity and value their heritage, history and cultural traditions and to prepare them for participatory citizenship after school. It also seeks to ensure learners demonstrate desirable literacy and numeracy skills including practical competences necessary for life. Errymaple High School pupils are making strides in acquiring life skills. According to the school’s principal, Mr Tawanda Guranyika, the toilet disinfectant produced by the pupils has seen the school cutting on expenditure. “The school used to allocate money for toilet disinfectant but this is no longer the case because it is now produced here,” he said.  Mr Guranyika said after pupils learnt about acids and uses of halogens during a science class, they decided to put the knowledge into practice. “At Errymaple High School, we are not only focusing on producing good grades but are also giving our students practical skills that they can apply and make use of even later in life. It is not just in sciences as we also offer Design and Technology, Computer Science, Agriculture, Business Studies and Music,” he said. Mr Guranyika said there is a market for toilet disinfectants because every home has a toilet. “At the moment we are looking at supplying our sister school Errymaple Junior School. From there, the sky is the limit as we have several schools and companies in Zvishavane,” he said. He said the 30 pupils are making almost 60 litres a week selling a litre for US$1,20. “Since its their first project, we supplied them with all the resources they need. The idea was the director (Mrs Ashell Ruswa)’s vision,” said Mr Guranyika. He said the new curriculum encourages a hands-on approach in solving challenges hence the pupils managed to address the issue of keeping the toilets clean. Mr Guranyika said pupils can apply everything they learn in real life situations. Tatenda Mukumbi, a Form Two pupil and one of the pupils who made the toilet disinfectant said it was a dream come true. “I am happy to be part of this history making class. I am also grateful to our teachers for affording us this opportunity to address challenges we face,” he said. <img class="wp-image-626158 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hazel Mashapa Fellow pupil Hazel Mashapa said she learnt a lot from practical subjects at the school. “I am also involved in this toilet disinfectant making project. We are looking at scaling up production so that we do not only produce for our own consumption but even surplus for sale,” she said.
