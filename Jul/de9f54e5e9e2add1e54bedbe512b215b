The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter A 46-YEAR-OLD Bulawayo man lost more than US$45 000 after three suspects ambushed him at Metro Peech and Browne Wholesalers in the city and robbed him of a cash box containing money at gunpoint and drove off in a Honda Fit. The incident, which occurred on Saturday, came barely two weeks after suspected armed robbers struck at a fruit and vegetable shop in Bulawayo’s city centre and got away with over US$13 000, R8 000 and $5 000. The suspects attacked shop workers while pointing guns at them before demanding cash from the safe and till machines. <img class="wp-image-626938 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Armed robber In the latest armed robbery, the suspects who were armed with a pistol, dragged the victim, Mr Allarahka Bapuslal from the shop and took a cash box containing US$45 110. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the armed robbery happened at 12.45PM at Metro Peech and Browne Wholesalers along Basch Street in Bulawayo. “We are investigating a robbery case that occurred in Bulawayo on Saturday at around 12.45PM in which a 46-year-old man was robbed of US$45 110 cash. The victim claims that the money was meant for payment of goods at the shop,” he said. <img class="wp-image-624232 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Honda Fit  “Three men armed with an unidentified pistol dragged the victim from the shop before they snatched his cash box and got into their getaway car, a silver Honda Fit and sped off.” Asst Comm Nyathi said no arrests have been made and they are still investigating the incident. He urged people to desist from moving around carrying large sums of money. “As police we continue to urge people to avoid carrying large sums of money in light of an increase in cases of armed robbery. Just last week, in Harare another victim lost more than US$30 000 to armed robbers,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. Last month, police in Bulawayo raised concern over rising armed robberies, with 15 cases having been recorded within the last two weeks of the previous month. They said although the cases are being recorded citywide, the majority of them are reported in western suburbs. In March, one of the country’s leading confectionery firms, Lobels Biscuits and Sweets lost over US$80 000 after burglars broke into its premises in Bulawayo’s Belmont industrial area. <img class="alignnone wp-image-600304 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Rands-and-USD.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Rands-and-USD.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Rands-and-USD-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The suspects made off with R16 739, P950, $110 266 in local currency and a laptop worth US$400. During the same month, armed robbers struck at Revelation Church of God in Bulawayo, beating up a pastor and two other congregants, before getting away with building funds; R20 000, US$300 and $10 000 in local currency. The five robbers, who were allegedly armed with axes, bolt cutters and a metal rod, struck in the dead of the night. The robbers reportedly knew that the church had collected money for the building fund. Recently, the Roman Catholic Church’s St Andrew’s Parish in Kingsdale, Bulawayo, was forced to suspend services after thieves stole sacred vessels used to conduct mass. Last year in August, six armed robbers were involved in a shootout with police in Bulawayo after they raided Choppies Parklands Supermarket and Access Finance in the city, getting away with nearly US$300 000 and R1 million. – @mashnets
