FOLLOWING a magnificent weekend performance by Highlanders that saw them thrashing visiting Manica Diamonds 3-0 at Barbourfields Stadium, coach Baltermar Brito says there’s still a lot of work to be done to transform his team. Brito has been in charge of three games since taking over the reins, winning his first match 3-2 against Black Rhinos, followed by a 1-1 draw at Ngezi Platinum Stars and Sunday’s win over Manica Diamonds. The seven points Brito has collected has enabled Highlanders to climb two places up the league table to sixth with 30 points.  It is, however, the display that Bosso exhibited that charmed their fans, who are beginning to see progress in terms of tactics and technical flair. What Brito seems to have instilled in his players is patience and confidence by allowing them to knock the ball around awaiting an opportune time to crack their opponents. Highlanders no longer rush their raids, even if their opponents close them, they keep passing the ball, patiently building up until an opening presents itself. <img class="alignnone wp-image-626800 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso are back to their old self of knocking the ball around, with build-ups starting from goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda through the defence that was made up of first goal scorer Peter Muduhwa, Mbongeni Ndlovu, Andrew Mbeba and Godfrey Makaruse. Makaruse, playing as a left wingback, is having a game of his life, as he has been given freedom to attack when he sees openings. He was on target for Bosso’s third goal on Sunday with a blistering long-range shot. Key to note with Muduhwa’s opener that came on the stroke of half-time is that he decided to venture upfront after seeing some open spaces left by Manica Diamonds. His grounder from the edge of the box beat keeper Jorum Muchambo. <img class="wp-image-622909 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Baltermar Brito Just like Makaruse, who has scored two goals since the arrival of Brito, striker Stanley Ngala is enjoying himself and scored Highlanders’ second goal, reacting quickly to pounce on a loose ball inside the box. Midfielders Devine Mhindirira and Ray Lunga are giving more attacking options, with Nqobizitha Masuku and Muziwakhe Dhlamini, who looked unsettled before being pulled out for Adrian Silla in the 25th minute, mopping up and at the same time also initiating attacks. <img class="wp-image-560144 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Peter-Maduhwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Peter-Maduhwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Peter-Maduhwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Peter Muduhwa But despite the performances that his charges put up against Ngezi and Manica Diamonds, Brito wants his players to give more. “We still have a lot of work to do. I believe in them (players). Every game is hard, there are no easy games. I think it’s a fair victory for us. The players must not sleep because of these three points. We can’t relax, we have to continue winning games,” said Brito. <img class="wp-image-612663 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ariel Sibanda The veteran gaffer took a bold step by introducing 16-year-old midfielder Prince Ndlovu in the 78th minute when they were leading 3-0. The Mzilikazi High schoolboy, who was promoted from the club’s developmental side last week, got a standing ovation from the Bosso fans, who have been yearning to see new talent. Ndlovu didn’t disappoint as he showed some flashes of brilliance and had he calmed his nerves; he could have scored on debut as he twice came face-to-face with Manica Diamonds goalie Muchambo. Brito is impressed with Ndlovu’s quality. “We signed the boy because he has quality and it doesn’t matter the game, he can play. I’m happy that his teammates did well to support him and make his debut enjoyable,” Brito said. Highlanders’ next match is away to Whawha, who lost 1-3 to Bulawayo City. — @ZililoR
