DEFENDING champions FC Platinum extended their winning run to seven matches and in the process open a five-point lead on the league table, as they continue their title defence, while their challengers stutter. The platinum miners edged Bulawayo Chiefs 1-0 courtesy of a late Lawrence Mhlanga strike to take their points’ tally to 43 from 20 games. Chiefs were punished for a lapse in concentration, but unlucky not to collect at least a point as they had managed to soak in the hosts’ pressure. But like champions, FC Platinum fought to the end, breaching Chiefs’ goal in the 88th minute. <img class="wp-image-485518 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Lawrence-Mhlanga.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Lawrence-Mhlanga.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Lawrence-Mhlanga-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lawrence Mhlanga What should frighten their rivals is that FC Platinum have kept a clean sheet in their seven-match winning streak. While the champions were celebrating their hard-fought victory, second-placed Chicken Inn were licking their wounds after suffering a second consecutive defeat when they were edged 1-0 by relegation threatened Tenax. Their defeat in Rusape followed a 0-3 drubbing by FC Platinum in Bulawayo last week. Losing two matches in a row left Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas baffled, as his side is slowly losing sight of the championship. <img class="wp-image-526162 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/FC-Platinum-players-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> FC Platinum However, Antipas wants his charges to focus on bouncing back instead of thinking about the title. “It’s now difficult for us, but we are still hopeful (of the title) as there are still more games ahead. We should not be worried too much about the championship, but our form, and start winning our games,” said Antipas. Harare giants Dynamos, who topped the table for the better part of the first part of the season, have also hit turbulent waters, going for three consecutive matches without a win. DeMbare are now third on the table with 35 points, eight behind FC Platinum, and were shocked 0-1 by Cranborne Bullets. <img class="wp-image-594973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/BOSSO-PLAYERS-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders It was an unlucky weekend for six out of the top seven teams, as they all failed to collect maximum points.
Fourth-placed Manica Diamonds were hammered 3-0 by Highlanders, while Triangle were held to a goalless draw by ZPC Kariba. Ngezi Platinum Stars, who went into the weekend in sixth, dropped into ninth place following their 3-0 mauling by Herentals, while Black Rhinos remained seventh after playing to a 0-0 draw against a 10-man Caps United. Highlanders moved two places up the ladder into sixth place with 30 points. Bosso are tied on points with Rhinos, but have a better goal difference. Tenax moved out of the bottom four into 14th with 20 points following their win over Chicken Inn. Second from bottom Bulawayo City beat anchors Whawha 3-1 to move to within two points of the safety zone. Caps United are just floating two points above the drop zone on 21 points.  Table
