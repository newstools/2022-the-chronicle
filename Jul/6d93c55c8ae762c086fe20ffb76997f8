The Chronicle Yvonne Ncube, Showbiz Correspondent ZIMBABWEAN actress, Danai Gurira, is set to return to the screens in the long-awaited blockbuster superhero movie Black Panther Wakanda Forever. Marvel Studios released the trailer of Black Panther Wakanda Forever on Saturday and the movie will debut in theatres on November 11. In 2018, over 75 000 Zimbabweans watched the first Black Panther movie in the box office, making it the highest grossing movie in the country surpassing crime thriller Fast 8. In Bulawayo the movie was oversubscribed at the Ster Kinekor Cinema, resulting in it being screened in all four cinemas on some days. It also spent over four months being screened until the entrance of another superhero movie, Avengers: Infinity War. Gurira, plays Okoye, the general of Wakanda’s elite female bodyguards, the Dora Milaje. <img class="wp-image-631315 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-6-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-6-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-6-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chadwick Boseman The teaser, which was shown on Saturday at the Comic-Con International in San Diego, features several cast members from the first film, as well as a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who played one of the protagonists, King T’Challa.
