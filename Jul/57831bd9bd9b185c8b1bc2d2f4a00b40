The Chronicle Deuteronomy 7:9 “Therefore know that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments; (NKJV) Most of the times, we are tempted to think we are great and powerful, and wise. Power and influence is dangerous and must be given to him who is thoroughly delivered and able to handle it. There is a famous quote that goes, “Power intoxicates the best hearts as wine the strongest heads. No man is trusted with unlimited power.” David did not have that character. He understood that the trillions he had were coming from God. You must know that every cent you have is of God. <img class="wp-image-603235 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible- Image taken from Shutterstock I know that you have a personal bank account but I am sorry to disturb your doctrine; it is not your money. Though in the physical world it may be in your possession. If you hope to be wealthy like David, embrace this teaching and apply it to your life. Never become big-headed, because you are driving an expensive car. Always be humble because you can be shocked when God humbles you Himself. There can be surprises, a David can just come and overtake you. So when you are blessed, remain with the heart that caused you to be blessed, do not change.  Strive to be faithful, to be found faithful in all areas, in tithe, in business, in marriage, and everything else. Be an emunah and God will multiply you, it is possible to have the wealth of David, God can enlarge your territory and you can be shocked. Whenever you are asked this question, “are you faithful?” Do not be quick to say, “Yes, I am!” That answer is not given by your mouth. I have never told my wife that she must trust me; I do things that assure her she can trust me. My deeds have earned her trust. I have seen men, who demand trust from their wives and complain that their wives are too suspicious. Trust does not come by confession; it is earned through your deeds. Similarly, if you want God to trust you, begin to tithe faithfully, give your pledge faithfully and serve with a true heart. When God sees that heart, He has no choice but to bless you, it will attract Him to make you abound with blessings. God bless! eaglelifeassembly@yahoo.com
