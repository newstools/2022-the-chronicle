The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Chronicle Reporter THE Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education says development of 21st century skills is critical in driving Zimbabwe’s transformation towards an upper middle-income status by 2030. This is why the country has mainstreamed research and innovation under its competence based curriculum so that locals develop adaptive abilities to live and work anywhere in the world. <img class="size-full wp-image-575816" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mrs-Tumisang-Thabela-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Tumisang Thabela Primary and Secondary Ministry secretary, Mrs Thumisang Thabela, said this in Bulawayo on Friday while addressing delegates who attended World Youth Skills Day. “With the emergence of an information-driven economy, the need for development of new 21st century skill sets that create adaptable citizens who can live and work competitively in the global village become imperative” said Mrs Thabela. “This is why the vision of the ministry is to be the leading provider of 21st century inclusive quality education for socio-economic transformation.” The permanent secretary stressed the need for stakeholders to invest more in education as a transformative and continuous process that holds the key to national development. “It goes beyond the theories we find in our very important books to the development of values, skills and competencies that shape an individual’s way of life,” she said. “It should prepare every student to be fit for purpose, for life and work.”  Mrs Thabela said going forward, the quality of human resources they produce through the education sector should be one with a tradable skill and a profile that tells the world about difference that their presence would make in the work place. She reiterated the importance of the Continuous Assessment Learning Activity (CALA) saying it has become a key component of the learning journey. “The CALA model is imparting to students the invaluable skill of research to help them appreciate that more often not truth and knowledge will be found on the surface, it is a treasure that lies buried in the ground and one must seek it with diligence and passion and conviction,” said Mrs Thabela. In her remarks, Youth, Sport Art and Recreation permanent secretary, Dr Thokozile Chitepo, said their ministry recognises the importance of strengthening, promoting and guiding vocational skills training and entrepreneurial development among youth and communities to ensure a labour force with appropriate skills to support national economic development. <img class="size-full wp-image-591999" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Dr-Thokozile-Chitepo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Dr-Thokozile-Chitepo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Dr-Thokozile-Chitepo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Thokozile Chitepo “Government through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation has embarked on a drive to establish at least one vocational training centre in all the districts of the country as we ensure alternative pathways to education are made available to disadvantaged youths and communities,” said Dr Chitepo. “This will ensure that all the youth who are leaving school, university and college will be able to get relevant skills for employment or entrepreneurship for industry growth. “This drive is in sync with the tenets outlined in NDS 1, which also put emphasis on human capital development as we strive towards an upper middle-income economy by 2030.” Dr Chitepo said vocational training centres have a mandate to develop an entrepreneurial and self-reliant culture among youths through vocational skills and business management. <img class="size-full wp-image-619609" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-302.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-302.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-302-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in Bulawayo Judith Ncube said the skills day was in sync with NDS1 and Vision 2030 ideals. “Bulawayo has many productive sectors, which include mining, farming, manufacturing, construction and food industries, arts and culture and many others, which the youths can participate into in order to develop their skills,” she said. -@SikhulekelaniM1
