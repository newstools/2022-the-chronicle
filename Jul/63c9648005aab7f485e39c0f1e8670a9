Our karatekas managed to compete with the best in the country and still excel. The idea was to give karatekas, both young and seniors, an opportunity to showcase their martial arts and we are pleased to have sent athletes to this competition, which was well organised.  Our chairperson Ndabezinhle Mazibuko also took part in the tournament in the veterans’ category. “He participated in the kata and kumite where he managed to win a bronze and gold medal respectively. We are proud of him for showing the youngsters how it’s done,” said Sibanada. The tournament, dubbed “Best of the Best”, saw several junior girls and boys as well as senior men and women battling it out for honours.
