The selection training game was the first of the year after the completion of the league which had been going on for the past six weeks. “We will come up with a team of about 30 and the final 30 is a team that we will start training with and will take on tour,” said Bulawayo Province 15s head coach, Ruben Kumpasa.  Kumpasa, who is also the head coach of the Warriors and Zimbabwe U14 assistant coach, was satisfied by the level of competition on display. “The young boys are really good,” Kumpasa told Chronicle Sports. He however emphasised the importance of having proper structures at club level so as to improve the game going forward so that some players don’t get lost. “We need to improve from clubs, most guys get lost where there are proper structures,” he said. <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 This would be the first tour after the Covid-19 break. The last tour was in 2017/18. The last time the provincial team went on a tour, they won the tournament which was held in Botswana. The aim of the tour is to revive rugby in Bulawayo as it has been a while since the city held such games. Kumpasa said: “We are trying to build and bring back rugby in Bulawayo.”
