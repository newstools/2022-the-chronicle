CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League title aspirants Chicken Inn are hoping to utilise the experience of South Africa bound goalkeeper Donovan Bernard and bounce back from their last defeat when they take on Tenax at Vengere Stadium in Rusape on Sunday. <img class="wp-image-595355 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-13-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-13-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-13-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Donovan Bernard Bernard has been snapped up by South African First Division side Tshakuma Tsha Madzivandila (TTM). He missed Chicken Inn’s 3-0 home drubbing by FC Platinum last week through suspension and his understudy Pride Zendera was thrown into the deep end in his first game of the season. The defeat saw Chicken Inn relinquishing top spot on the table, with FC Platinum completing a remarkable turnaround by going top after struggling at the beginning of the season, as their new youngsters struggled to gel. FC Platinum have a two-point lead over the Gamecocks with 40 points from 19 games. Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas wants his side to bounce back and complete a double over Tenax, who they beat 3-0 in the reverse fixture. “The game against FC Platinum was one of those where we went to sleep. We’ve been working throughout the week to try and rectify mistakes that cost us three points. We want to get back to winning ways and start doing better, starting with the trip to Tenax. One thing for sure is that we can play well when we want and we have to give the guys confidence,” Antipas said. He also confirmed the imminent departure of Donovan and said they wanted to use his experience before he leaves. “We missed Donovan, but this is not to say Pride (Zendera) is a bad goalie.  We shot ourselves down by making mistakes, which we were punished for by an alert FC Platinum. We were too slow to the ball and lost almost all the second balls. “Donovan returns from suspension. He will be going to TTM anytime and we will miss him dearly. Obviously, we have to give Pride confidence because he is a good goalkeeper. But in the meantime, we also have to get the whole team back to confidence and as a firm believer in using the best players, I will give Donovan a start so that we win and when he leaves, Pride will come in to a team that is high on confidence.” He ruled out signing a goalkeeper during the mid-season transfer window, saying they will promote one from the club’s junior development side. Samuel Mafukidze and Zendera, who have been deputising Bernard will compete for the starting place, although the latter is tipped to be the next regular keeper. Chicken Inn have also completed the signing of defender Vincent Moyo from Bulawayo City and he has started training with his new teammates. “Vincent Moyo is one of the two additions that we’ve made in the mid-season transfer window. The other player we have registered is striker Clive Augusto. <img class="wp-image-606462 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Clive-Augusto.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Clive-Augusto.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Clive-Augusto-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clive Augusto It is difficult to get a good, experienced goalkeeper during the mid-season transfer window, meaning we have to look at a youngster from our development side to fill the gap that Donovan will leave,” said Antipas.
