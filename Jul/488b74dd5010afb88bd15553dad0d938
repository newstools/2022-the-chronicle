OVER 350 entries were received by the Post and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) for this year’s Hackathon challenge, which has been attributed to interest from innovators around the country. The hackathon, organised by Potraz has $175 million up for grabs and this week in Mutare about 50 shortlisted candidates will receive money for their innovative ideas. <img class="wp-image-430328 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Gift-Machengete.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Gift-Machengete.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Gift-Machengete-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Gift Machengete Launched in 2020, the hackathon is open to all Zimbabweans. Last year, 10 winners from across Zimbabwe, were awarded prizes from the $32 million that was up for grabs. The word hackathon comes from blending the words Marathon and Hack, where marathon refers to performing a long or difficult activity in a short period and Hack refers to exploratory computer programming.  During a hackathon, participants spend a short period, usually between 24-48 hours which can go up to a week, building, creating and delivering an ICT solution to a specified problem. <img class="wp-image-622954 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-27-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-27-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-27-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> hackathon Potraz director-general Dr Gift Machengete said the response to this year’s hackathon was pleasing. “This year we received 371 responses for the hackathon and this was a great response. I can’t remember the actual figure but this was an increase from last year,” said Dr Machengete. “We attribute this increase to interest in the hackathon and that it was open to everyone. This year the hackathon wasn’t confined to one subject matter, like last year, where it was agriculture  and health, which was limiting,” said Dr Machengete. <img class="wp-image-610168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-62-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-62-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-62-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Agriculture He said today at a local hotel, a hackathon function will be held to find 50 winners of the prize money that will be shared. “There will be a hackathon function this Friday(today) in Mutare, where they will pitch their ideas and after that winners are receiving money for their projects.
