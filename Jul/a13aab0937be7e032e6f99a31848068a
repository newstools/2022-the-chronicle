The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter A FORM Four pupil at Regina Mundi Secondary in Lupane, Matabeleland North allegedly committed suicide at the boarding school’s premises under unclear circumstances. <img class="wp-image-629827 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-35.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-35.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-35-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Regina Mundi Secondary Leonardo Ngwenya (17) was found hanging from a tree at the school at about 3:30pm on Saturday. A source said the boy could have been troubled as recently his parents were called to the school, relating to his behaviour. Another source said the boy was expected to appear before the school’s disciplinary committee over a case of misconduct. The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in conjunction with the police have launched an investigation to establish what could have triggered the incident. The ministry’s communication and advocacy director Mr Taungana Ndoro yesterday said it was difficult to ascertain what caused the unfortunate incident as the boy did not leave a suicide note. “It is very unfortunate I also got to know about the case about an hour ago. We don’t know what exactly happened to the learner. We are also trying to establish what could have triggered this as there was no suicide note that was left behind. He was found hanging from a tree on July 16. Police and our teams are on the ground to try and establish what could have caused this incident,” said Mr Ndoro.  He said the ministry has deployed a provincial guidance and counselling team to provide counselling to other learners at the school. Mr Ndoro said the ministry has guidance and counselling lessons as part of the education curriculum which pupils should utilise whenever they are experiencing challenges. <img class="alignnone wp-image-450116 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/hanging1.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/hanging1.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/hanging1-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We want to express our condolences to the family of the deceased. We have also sent our teams to the ground to provide psychosocial support teams to other learners. We want them to understand that while this incident has happened it is not usual within our schools. This is not prevalent within our schools. It might be the first case in a very long time,” said Mr Ndoro. He said the case was unlikely caused by bullying as such is not expected particularly for 17 year olds in schools. “We also need to interrogate this case beyond what could have happened in the school. We need also to assess his home situation as we try to establish what could have happened. Because at school we have senior teachers who have been assigned the role to counsel pupils. Girls have a female senior teacher while boys have a male senior teacher who should provide counseling services to them,” he said. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Glory Banda could not be reached for comment. — @nqotshili
