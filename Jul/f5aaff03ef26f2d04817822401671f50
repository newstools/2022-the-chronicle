The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter THE United College of Education (UCE) in Bulawayo plays host to the National Association of Primary Heads (Naph) inter-provincial ball games starting today. The games, which will be the first since the outbreak of Covid-19, will be hosted in one venue at UCE grounds. The Naph games were last played in 2019. Speaking to Chronicle Sports, Naph president, Cynthia Khumalo said the city of Plumtree was supposed to host the games this year, but lack of capacity saw them moved to Bulawayo. “Plumtree did not have the capacity, like accommodation, to host the delegates,” said Khumalo According to Khumalo all the 10 provinces in the country will be participating in different sporting disciplines. <img class="wp-image-621265 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-469.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-469.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-469-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Cynthia Nkala-Khumalo The games that will be played include soccer for boys, basketball and volleyball for both boys and girls and netball for girls. This year, there will be no soccer for girls due to financial constraints. The Government recently allowed schools to resume sporting activities after Covid-19 had brought them to a standstill. “We have only started now, so we decided to just select a few games,” said Khumalo. <img class="wp-image-609885 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-64.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-64.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-64-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sports The main aim of the games, according to Khumalo, is to identify talent that will be used to come up with a team that will represent Zimbabwe in international games against regional powerhouses such as Namibia, Lesotho and Botswana.
