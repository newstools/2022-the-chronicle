PANTHERS Taekwondo Academy conducted a grading promotion test in Bulawayo at the weekend to upgrade their students. The grading promotion saw 16 participants come out good. The academy president Vusa Ncube conducted the grading. A grading assesses one’s technical ability, knowledge, indomitable spirit and physical conditioning, and most importantly allows rank advancement. <img class="wp-image-614584 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 “Our athletes have not had many chances to upgrade owing to Covid-19. But now that things have opened up we are trying to ensure that our athletes upgrade. This particular grading was meant to prepare our team that will compete at our 15th anniversary in October here in Bulawayo. It will be a high standard competition which is why we are working to upgrade these guys to the senior level,” said Ncube. He also hinted they might open academies in Matabeleland North where he feels pure talent remains untapped.  Taekwondo, Tae Kwon Do or Taekwon-Do is a Korean form of martial arts, characterised by punching and kicking techniques, with emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping spinning kicks and fast kicking techniques. The sport remains a minority discipline with most people shunning it because of the perception that it is violent. PANTHERS ACADEMY GRADING LIST
