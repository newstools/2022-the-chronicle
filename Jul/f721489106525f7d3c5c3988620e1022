Nothing was recovered. The building, located at the Tsholotsho Business Centre, was built and donated to the district by Plan International in 2002. <img class="size-full wp-image-626929" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Zanu-PF-Second-Secretary-Cde-Kembo-Mohadi-addressing-Education-Ministry-officials-and-other-stakeholders-in-Tsholotsho-recently3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Zanu-PF-Second-Secretary-Cde-Kembo-Mohadi-addressing-Education-Ministry-officials-and-other-stakeholders-in-Tsholotsho-recently3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Zanu-PF-Second-Secretary-Cde-Kembo-Mohadi-addressing-Education-Ministry-officials-and-other-stakeholders-in-Tsholotsho-recently3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Burnt building Most learning material for the district was kept at the building before being distributed to beneficiaries while most organisations conducted their workshops at the hall within the building which had a number of offices and storerooms. Speaking after an impromptu tour of the venue on Wednesday last week when he visited the district to meet party structures as well as traditional leaders, Cde Mohadi said he will engage the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education officials at the head office to expedite the reconstruction of the building.  “This is a key building for the district. I shall engage the Ministry at head office level to assist in the reconstruction of this building,” said Cde Mohadi who was accompanied by the Minister of Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Matabeleland North Cde Richard Moyo, Tsholotsho Senator Cde Alice Dube, Tsholotsho South and North House of Assembly representatives Musa Ncube and Retired Brigadier General Sibangumuzi Khumalo. To kickstart the reconstruction project, schools in the district have agreed to levy each learner at every school a once off payment of 15 rand. There are 85 primary and 35 secondary schools in Tsholotsho district. <img class="size-full wp-image-626923" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Zanu-PF-Second-Secretary-Cde-Kembo-Mohadi-addressing-Education-Ministry-officials-and-other-stakeholders-in-Tsholotsho-recently1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Zanu-PF-Second-Secretary-Cde-Kembo-Mohadi-addressing-Education-Ministry-officials-and-other-stakeholders-in-Tsholotsho-recently1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Zanu-PF-Second-Secretary-Cde-Kembo-Mohadi-addressing-Education-Ministry-officials-and-other-stakeholders-in-Tsholotsho-recently1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Burnt building Cde Mohadi however expressed disappointment at the lack of a fire extinguisher at the building, something which could have worsened the situation. The Tsholotsho Rural District Council also does not have a fire tender vehicle. A number of buildings at the business centre have been burnt to the ground before with the council having to summon fire tenders from Bulawayo. Council chairperson Mr Esau Siwela recently told Chronicle that the purchase of a fire tender vehicle was not on the council’s priority list. The council recently bought a top range Toyota GD6 vehicle for its chief executive officer.
