He is the third signing of the Ten Hag era following the capture of left-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord and the free transfer of former Brentford and Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen. Manchester United football director John Murtough said: “Lisandro is an outstanding player who will bring further quality and experience to Erik’s squad. “We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United and we are looking forward to seeing him develop further and help the team achieve the success we are aiming for.” United, who finished a disappointing sixth in the Premier League last season, host Brighton on 7 August in their first match of the new campaign. — SuperSport
