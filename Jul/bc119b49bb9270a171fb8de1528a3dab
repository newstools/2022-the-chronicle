THE City of Kings and Queens is slowly turning to be a holy ground as yet another gospel event is set to be held here next month. The Worship Explosion, an annual event in its second edition was first held in South Africa last year. A brainchild of Nathie Ignatious Mabhena, this year’s event is set to be headlined by gospel musos – Siza Mdlongwa, Minister Babusie, Minister Vuyo, South Africa-based Mandy M, Minister Fie, Minister Voxie, Natasha, B Jewel and Matthew Chishumba. Centenary Building (9th Avenue between Fort and Herbert Chitepo) will be the place to be on August 13 for an ultimate praise and worship experience.  Mabhena said the event seeks to ignite a Christian flair among the people of Bulawayo. “When going through the scripture, I understood that we serve a God that feeds on worship so I decided to create a worship day where people come together and worship God. The event is all about worship and bringing worshippers together,” he said. Proceeds from the event, Mabhena said will go towards helping vulnerable communities. “Twenty percent of the proceeds from ticket sales will go to an orphanage as a way of giving back to the community,” he said. The Worship Explosion comes after the success of three gospel events this year that were opened up by Everton Mlalazi who staged a homecoming gig followed by Pastor Barak with the Wavuma Experience. The most recent was Janet Manyowa’s debut show in the city. – @mthabisi_mthire
