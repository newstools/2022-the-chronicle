Property fires increased by 33 percent compared to the same month last year. Veld fires decreased by 88 percent,” read the report. The estimated total loss from the fires stood at $4,9 million. The local authority said carelessly discarded lit material and deliberate burning were the main causes of fire outbreaks during the month.  Four fires were due to arson, four others were linked to electrical faults, two were caused by gas cylinder leakages and 10 were started by discarded lit material. Council said despite the decrease in veld fires, people should not let their guard down as the fire season which starts this month-end is approaching. The fire season stretches from July 31 to October 31. Veld fires have in the past been listed as one of the greatest environmental challenges as they destroy forests, kill animals and destroy property. Last week the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) embarked on an awareness campaign urging people to prepare fireguards. <img class="wp-image-626527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environmental Management Agency (EMA) EMA Matabeleland South provincial manager Mr Decent Ndlovu said communities should prepare fireguards to avoid loss of life and property. “People should clear their fireguards so that they manage veld fires. We’re conducting veld fire awareness campaigns and inspecting fireguards,” said Mr Ndlovu.
