THE task force on economic affairs under the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) will hold its first meeting in nearly two years in Mutare tomorrow, as parties resume engagements to iron out differences between business and Government. Minister of Public Service, Labour, and Social Welfare Paul Mavima confirmed in an interview that after the Mutare meeting, the TNF would convene in the next two weeks to discuss the issues that taskforce would bring before the main TNF wing.
