It provides a platform for local creatives to interact, learn and share ideas on music, poetry and digital art. “The aim of the residency is to facilitate cross-cultural collaboration with Zimbabwean and UK artistes, inter-city travel and the creation of new digital art. All of these will contribute to helping these creatives expand and leverage on each other’s network, enhance their digital content creation and gain more exposure for their work,” said Mapondera. – @eMKlass-49
