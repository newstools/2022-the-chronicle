Sadc Deputy Secretary for Regional Integration, Dr Thembinkosi Mhlongo, revealed the plan in Gaborone, Botswana, during a recent meeting with Ms Yuka Fujino, the Chargé d’affaires of the Japanese Embassy in Botswana, which is the headquarters of the regional bloc. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD-8), as well as other issues of mutual interest to the two  parties. “Dr Mhlongo highlighted Sadc’s efforts to expand solar energy generation output in order to increase its power generation capacity, corridor involvement, and economic prosperity while also reducing the region’s carbon footprint,” said Sadc in a post meeting statement. “He said that in light of the recent increase in the number and severity of disasters, there was a need for increased collaborative efforts with partners to put in place mechanisms, including the operationalisation of the Sadc Humanitarian and Emergency Operations Centre that will aid the region in mitigating disasters and monitoring all disaster risk factors.” Dr Mhlongo also underscored the importance of the existing cordial relations between the Japanese government and the Sadc region, in particular, the technical assistance offered by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which has assisted in the implementation of a number of programmes in the region, including the recently built Kazungula Bridge, which connects Botswana and Zambia. <img class="wp-image-624484 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Mention was also made of the support towards the implementation of the Sadc Forestry Programme, as evidence of Japan’s dedication to serving the Sadc community. In her remarks Ms Fujino emphasised the Japanese government’s willingness to collaborate with Sadc and the entire African continent as part of its international policy. “In addition, the envoy underlined the significance of working on engagement mechanisms to promote a more inclusive relationship,” said the bloc. “Ms Fujino stated that her government will spearhead the 8th TICAD, which will be held in Tunisia on the 27th and 28th of August 2022, with the participation of heads of state and government from African countries, as well as co-organisers from the African Union, United Nations, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank.” The Japanese top official also noted that the forum will provide Japan with the opportunity to strengthen its engagement in Africa.  “She expressed her regret that in view of the limitations posed by the need to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, participation at the upcoming TICAD-8 will be limited, and as such regional organisations, including Regional Economic Communities, may not be able to participate,” she said. Since 1993, Japan has pioneered an international forum for Africa through TICAD to foster partnerships and development.
