She said by continuously engaging the mining sector, it shows their firm commitment in playing their part in achieving the US$12 billion target. “As the agency, we are very supportive of the US$12 billion target. We are not at loggerheads with miners but we want to build a mining sector that brings on board best practices so that we have a situation whereby mining is done in a manner that does not harm the environment,” she said. “We want to ensure that mining activities continue in the future. Mining contributes huge amounts to the gross domestic product, therefore, this is a game changer but at the same time, it should also contribute to the protection of the environment.”. Mines and Mining Development Minister, Winston Chitando, who also conducted a tour of the stands, expressed satisfaction with the quality of displays by small scale miners. He said he was impressed with the high turnout of locals, in particular. “The exhibition was exceptionally successful. What was pleasing is the number of participants from the small-scale sector and upcoming service providers who are Zimbabweans. “There are a lot of Zimbabweans who are in the exploration space, equipment provision, processing and safety provision and it was very impressive,” said the minister. Over 160 direct participants drawn from the local sector and from other countries such as China, South Africa and the United Kingdom took part.
