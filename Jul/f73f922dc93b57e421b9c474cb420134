The Chronicle  Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter BULAWAYO-born hip-hop artiste Neville Sigauke continues to raise the Zimbabwean flag high with his latest achievement being having his works showcased on MTV Base. His success goes on to popularise his trademark Mbira Dze hip-hop genre which is a fusion of the traditional mbira instrument and the urban hip-hop beat. The track Idlozi is a collaboration between the Nketa-bred musician and South African vocalist Thomas Mokoena aka Olley. It was produced by Zimbabwean beat-maker DJ Jabs and listening to the teaser, one hears a fusion of Afro-House, Amapiano, and Mbira, of which the Mbira was played by Zimbabwean artiste Samukoko. Sigauke said he is on cloud nine with the success of the track which landed on radio stations regionally before the visuals got recognition from MTV Base. <img class="wp-image-625681 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Neville-Sigauke-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Neville-Sigauke-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Neville-Sigauke-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Neville Sigauke “The song was released in February and it has been on local radio stations here in South Africa and Zimbabwe as well. Internationally, it has featured on Voice of America’s Africa 54 and Music Time in Africa which is based in Washington. The recent milestone is the video being premiered on MTV Base,” said Sigauke.

My goal is to spread positivity and unite cultures through music.
