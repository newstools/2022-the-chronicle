The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Chiefs assistant coach Thulani Sibanda, who is being touted as a possible replacement for under-pressure coach Lloyd Chitembwe at Caps United, says he is staying put with the Ninjas. Caps United have been on a nosedive, suffering seven consecutive defeats and failing to score in their last six matches, and are reported to be trying to lure Sibanda to arrest the rot. Caps United’s last win was on April 10 when they edged Yadah 1-0, but financial problems rocked their boat leading to an embarrassing player strike ahead of their league match against Cranborne Bullets, which they lost 2-0. <img class="wp-image-623527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nilton Terroso Sibanda says he is content at Chiefs and is not considering leaving the ambitious club since rejoining them in March. “I’ve seen reports linking me to Caps United, but I’m not thinking of leaving Bulawayo Chiefs anytime soon, as I’m enjoying my apprenticeship under coach Nilton (Terroso). I’m learning a lot from Nilton and I think it will be stupid of me to leave at a time when I’m benefiting from his knowledge. I used to research and get modern training methods online, but now I’m learning them directly every day from him. “While it is flattering to have my name being linked to Caps United, it is important for me to be capacitated before making any move as head coach at any club,” said Sibanda. Before rejoining Chiefs in March after the club parted with assistants Mark Mathe and Farai Tawachera, Sibanda confirmed having held talks with Caps United officials. <img class="wp-image-607530 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Farai Tawachera “Before they hired Chitembwe, someone from Caps United had asked if I could assist then coach Darlington Dodo, but nothing came out of it. Maybe the reports coming now emanate from those past conversations,” Sibanda said. The Terroso and Sibanda combination seems to be yielding desired results and Chiefs have gone for a nine-match unbeaten run, collecting 17 points from a possible 27. They have won four games and drawn five times. In the first nine games that Chiefs played with Terroso being assisted by Mathe and Tawachera, the team only managed nine points. — @ZililoR
