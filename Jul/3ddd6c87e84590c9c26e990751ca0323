BUDDING entrepreneurs should register their businesses and quickly embrace Intellectual Property (IP) protection. Speaking during a ‘Next She Exporter’ programme in Bulawayo last Friday, ZimTrade marketing specialist, Ms Nozipho Maphala said entrepreneurs should register their businesses. She said export trade is regulated by rules and regulations and specific procedures that must be adhered to in line with legal requirements. <img class="alignnone wp-image-460626 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Intellectual-Property-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Intellectual-Property-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Intellectual-Property--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The on-going export capacity development programme, she said, was initiated to assist female entrepreneurs with relevant export market information. Ms Maphala said businesses that are registered are in a better position to access financial assistance. “There are many benefits that arise from registering businesses such as legal binding payment contracts and attracting buyers from reputable businesses,” she said. In order to protect one’s IP, a company must be registered formally so that the brand, trademark or logo is protected.  “Some producers in the Arts and Crafts who are yet to register their businesses encounter challenges such as mass production of their works by individuals who then sell them cheaply. I therefore encourage small businesses to work on their copyright, patenting and registering trademarks,” said Ms Maphala. – @BlehKarubwa.
