He was remanded in custody to August 4. It was not stated in court what the businesswomen were dealing in. The court heard that on the first count, Mahembe was allegedly in a relationship with the first victim Ms Patricia Mutero. Between August and September last year, Mahembe allegedly asked Ms Mutero to visit him at Chachacha business centre in Shurugwi. The court heard that the woman drove her white Honda Fit to see him and arrived at Chachacha business centre at 7PM.
Mahembe and Ms Mutero allegedly spent the whole night drinking beer.  The court heard that the following day at around 12PM, Mahembe requested to be intimate with her before they drove to a dip tank called Dhonga at Chachacha business centre. Because they had spent the whole night drinking beer, the court heard that upon arrival at the dip tank, Ms Mutero fell asleep leaning on the steering wheel. Mahembe, the court heard, disembarked from the passenger side and went to the back seat behind her. He allegedly grabbed his lover from the back before strangling her to death in her sleep. Mahembe allegedly put Ms Mutero’s body on the back seat, started the vehicle and drove to Gwamvurachena River in Makotore Village, Shurugwi where he wrapped her body with a red blanket. The court heard that Mahembe dug a shallow grave and buried the body. Mahembe allegedly went on to use the deceased’s vehicle and later swapped it with a Toyota Fun Cargo belonging to one Mr Tafadzwa Mutare. The car was valued at US$3500 and it was not recovered. <img class="wp-image-576954 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/gavel.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/gavel.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/gavel-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> gavel On the second count, the court heard that Mahembe started a relationship with the second victim Ms Idah Chigumbate in May this year.
