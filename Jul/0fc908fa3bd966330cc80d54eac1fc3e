TEAMS that went into the weekend occupying the bottom four places in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League table picked vital wins as they continue to fight for survival. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628978 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-8-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-8-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-8-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Whawha, who anchor the log, claimed a big win as they stunned a charged up Highlanders 2-1 at Gweru’s Ascot Stadium, a result that failed to lift up the prison wardens who seem to have a knack for causing upsets. The victory took Whawha’s points tally to 18 in 21 games. Highlanders joined Chicken Inn, Ngezi Platinum Stars, Yadah and Tenax in the list of teams that have left Ascot with tails between their legs after succumbing to Whawha. Bulawayo City, who went into the weekend second from the bottom, moved a place up the ladder following a 1-0 home win against Tenax, who slipped to 17th from position 14. The local authority bankrolled side now has 21 points in 21 games and heading into the weekend clash against wounded Highlanders, Bulawayo City have every reason to believe in their abilities of swimming out of the murky relegation waters. “It was a good victory and if we can continue grinding results, I think we will survive. Credit to the boys who keep on pushing hard and what we’re demonstrating is that through teamwork, we can achieve our goals,” said Bulawayo City coach, Farai Tawachera. ZPC Kariba and Harare City, who completed the bottom four teams before the weekend games, moved out of relegation slots following their identical 1-0 wins against Cranborne Bullets and Triangle United respectively. Harare City and ZPC Kariba are tied on 22 points together with Cranborne Bullets and Caps United who held Ngezi Platinum Stars to a 2-2 draw. <img class="wp-image-610372 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-90-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-90-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-90-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Caps United While the bottom teams celebrated their hard-fought wins that give them reason to believe they can survive the chop, Chicken Inn completed a double over Bulawayo Chiefs who they beat 3-1. Chiefs lost the first leg 2-1. Chiefs have gone for four matches without a win, including three consecutive defeats. Their last victory was on June 3 when they edged Yadah 1-0 in Harare. That was followed by a 2-2 away draw at Triangle, then identical 1-0 defeats to Cranborne Bullets and FC Platinum before going down to Chicken Inn at the weekend.  Chiefs remained glued on position 10 with 26 points while Chicken Inn reduced FC Platinum’s lead to three points. The Gamecocks on 41 points maximised on FC Platinum’s 0-0 draw with Dynamos. Chicken Inn’s coach, Joey Antipas believes the win against Chiefs gets them back into title contention. “It’s good that we won and now that we’ve managed to collect maximum points, it should get our confidence levels up. “The championship race is a marathon like I have said and what is important is to try keep winning and control what we can,” Antipas said.
