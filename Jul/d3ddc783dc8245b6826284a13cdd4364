ZIFA Southern Region Division One top goal scorer Stanson Khanye has set himself a target of 20 goals before the mid-season transfer window closes on July 31. Khanye (25), who plays for Quality Foods, has found the back of the net 15 times in 21 appearances this season and believes topflight clubs will snap him up if he reaches that target. He was on target at the weekend when his team played to a 1-1 draw against CIWU at White City Stadium B Arena. “When the season started, I set myself a target of 10 goals and I managed to do that. I think setting myself a target has really helped me get to where I am. I want to play topflight football and I think if I can get to 20 goals during this window, some teams may be interested in my services,” said Khanye. <img class="wp-image-607803 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> White City Stadium The striker is gifted with pace, skill and precision, and feels he is at his peak. “I believe I’m playing well because of the targets I have set for myself.
