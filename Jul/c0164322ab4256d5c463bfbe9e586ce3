RUZIVE Ruzive, the former Fifa referee who won many accolades for his exploits in domestic football, has been included in the new Zifa Referees Committee (ZRC) mandated to improve officiating standards. <img class="wp-image-546759 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fifa Referees have been under the spotlight in the recent past for questionable officiating which is threatening to spoil football. Some of the problems bedevilling ZRC include the appointment of inexperienced match officials to preside over big matches as well as fast tracking some referees into the Zifa panel. The Zifa executive committee resolved to appoint Barbra Chikosi to lead ZRC with Ruzive being the deputy chairperson and Fifa certified instructor, Sabelo Maphosa coming in as the secretary of the referees’ panel. Former Fifa referees Makonese Masakadza and Wilfred Mukuna complete the five-member ZRC. Acting Zifa chief executive officer Xolisani Gwesela said the association’s executive committee resolved that while it is desirable to engage Fifa and have Zimbabwe’s suspension from international football lifted, it is prudent to come up with local reforms to resuscitate and grow the beautiful game of football. <img class="wp-image-589133 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Xolisani-Gwesela-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Xolisani-Gwesela-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Xolisani-Gwesela-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Acting Zifa chief executive officer Xolisani Gwesela The executive went on to appoint a 12-member strategic planning committee that is expected to come up with long-term plans. The strategic planning committee is chaired by Alois Masepe and includes Pithias Shoko, Nhamo Tutisani, Nhlanhla Dube, Memory Mbondiya, Zifa Southern Region chairman Andrew Tapela, PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele, renowned junior development specialist Marc Duvillard, Theresa Maguraushe, Morris Banda, football legend Moses Chunga and Nobioth Magwizi. “The Executive Committee noted with great concern that Zifa has, for a long time, been operating without strategic direction and resolved to appoint a strategic planning committee to come up with a long-term strategic plan which will guide the Association’s activities and operations and consequently aid in growing football while producing competitive national teams,” said Gwesela.  The Zifa executive committee resolved that it is of paramount importance to adhere to the constitution, and will call for the Annual General Meeting, with dates announced in due course. Age cheating, which Zifa acknowledges threatens football’s development, was discussed at the Friday meeting. “Zifa has zero tolerance to age cheating and will ensure that such vices are eradicated in sport,” Gwesela said.
