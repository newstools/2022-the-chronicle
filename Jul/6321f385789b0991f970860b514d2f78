He said Hardlife Mushipe (26) and brothers Liberty (22) and Trust Chipanga (23) all from Gokwe were arrested following swift police response and co-operation from the members of the public. “The circumstances as reported are that, three men broke into a house in the high density suburb, armed with logs, a hoe handle and logs. They awakened three occupants who were sleeping in two separate rooms, Kudakwashe Muurungi (39) and his wife — now deceased Pretty Mxotshwa (34) and a niece, Cedilla Mushava (22),” said Insp Mahoko. He said Mushipe and the Chipanga brothers allegedly indiscriminately assaulted Muurungi, Mxotshwa and Mushava using logs and a hoe handle all over their bodies demanding money. Insp Mahoko said Mushava allegedly surrendered her cellphone while Kudakwashe surrendered US$12 and Mxotshwa surrendered US$300. “For a while, the robbers continued assaulting them demanding more money. <img class="wp-image-625168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-72.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-72.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-72-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> money They then pulled Mxotshwa, who had fallen unconscious, outside the house before disappearing into the night,” said Insp Mahoko. He said a report was made to the police who attended the scene. “Police attended the scene and it was discovered that Mxotshwa had succumbed to injuries sustained when she was assaulted by the robbers. Her body had deep cuts on the head and bruises all over. At the scene, police recovered a pellet gun, two blood stained logs, a hoe handle and a machete that had been used by Mushipe and Chipanga brothers during the robbery,” said Insp Mahoko. He said a police operation by a special unit being run in the province to account for criminals perpetrating serious crimes carried out investigations and arrested the three suspects in Nyamazana Village, under Chief Njelele in Gokwe.  “The suspects are now in police custody while investigations are progressing. So far the suspects have been linked to a number of other robberies committed in Kwekwe and we expect the suspects to clear many of them,” said Insp Mahoko. “May I take this opportunity to warn would-be criminals and all those conspiring to commit serious crimes like murder and robberies or any other crime in Midlands Province that they will be arrested. Our strategy of specialised crack teams hunting for criminals behind offences committed in the province is giving us results.” Insp Mahoko urged members of the public to report cases to the police adding that those with information that might lead to the arrest of criminals must visit their nearest police station. “Members of the public with information regarding people wanted for any crime please come forward and we guarantee that we’ll arrest them,” he said.
