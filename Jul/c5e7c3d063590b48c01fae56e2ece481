WHAT is often regarded as modern architecture and international interior décor standard has slowly made its way into Bulawayo homes. Diasporans and local home builders having been exposed to trendy home décor designs want that flair in their homes.
This has seen them employing youthful skilled artisans who are able to replicate some of these classy home décor designs to beautify their homes. The skills of some of the Bulawayo artisans has seen them even getting jobs in cities such as Harare among other parts of the country. “Some of our clients bring video footage of designs that they would have watched on social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram and request that we replicate them as they build their homes. We have been able to do exactly that,” said Mr Mlamuli Dube (32), a plumber with skills in tilling. He is among some of the enterprising youths who are enjoying the benefits of manual labour skills at a time when formal employment is a challenge for many. He is involved in bringing world class interior décor through tiling and designing ensuites for residential areas. Mr Dube decided to pursue vocational skill training when he completed Ordinary Level in 2007 and discovered that a lot of graduates were struggling to get employed <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-628489" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/desolate-The-once-upon-a-time-citadel-of-vocational-and-sporting-activities-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/desolate-The-once-upon-a-time-citadel-of-vocational-and-sporting-activities-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/desolate-The-once-upon-a-time-citadel-of-vocational-and-sporting-activities--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He enrolled at Tshaka Vocational Training Centre in Makokoba suburb, where he studied sewer and water plumbing and later added tiling to his skills. “I trained at the council-run Tshaka Vocational Training Centre between 2008 and 2010. After that I started my practice as I gained experience during my time at the training institution. In 2011 then I trained in tilling. So, I have never sought employment as I have been self-employed since I started work,” he said. ‘I’m happy to say this is paying for me and I have since employed three people who work for me. I believe I’m doing well because sometimes we are overwhelmed with clients. So, the biggest challenge is that we might have more clients than we are able to attend to at a given time.” Mr Dube said this leads him to subcontract some of the jobs to other artisanal workers with similar skills. He said reputation is one of the biggest assets in his trade. “We get most of our clients through referrals. When you do a good job and someone who wants a similar service sees it, they will also come forward asking that we do the job for them. So, this is what has sustained me for more than 10 years, having people referring each other to me based on what I would have done for them,” said Mr Dube.  He said due to excellence in his craft, he has been asked to do jobs in other cities and towns around the country. Mr Dube said he has done jobs in Gweru, Kwekwe, Beitbridge, Gwanda, Plumtree, and Esigodini among other areas. He said he has become part of a network of skilled workers who offer services to the public. “What we have observed is that a lot of people struggle to get reliable people to do jobs for them, so we have established a network consisting of builders, plumbers, electricians and tilers who can start and complete a house project. This network has reliable people because when someone fails to do the job to the expectation of the client, the client will come back to you. So, we make sure that everyone in this network is reliable and does not cause problems for clients,” he said. Mr Dube said he would soon be building his own home as he has already bought a housing stand. Tiler Mr Mthokozisi Ncube from Pumula North, who also works closely with Mr Dube said his reputation has resulted in him getting jobs outside Bulawayo. “Most of the jobs that I get out of Bulawayo are a result of the quality of work I do. Clients that I would have done a job for refer each other to me and that is how I get most of my jobs. I have done jobs in areas such as Harare and even in Tsholotsho. I have been doing this for at least 18 years. However, I did not learn this at school, I grew up in a family which was involved in construction work while others were doing welding, I found comfort in this,” said Mr Ncube. He said being part of a network of skilled workers has also enabled him to get new clients while redirecting others. A home builder, Mrs Ntombenhle Nkomo, said she has benefitted from the professional skills of the artisan network. “I watch a lot of television home décor shows as we are in the process of building our dream house. I have gathered ideas from what I watch on television as well as online platforms. I was charmed as they showed me similar trendy designs that they have already done in several homes here. they also do it with professionalism which is rare to find,” said Mrs Nkomo.–@nqotshili
