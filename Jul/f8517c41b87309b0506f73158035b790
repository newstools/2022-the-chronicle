The Chronicle Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter Electricity load shedding in the city is forcing more Bulawayo residents to resort to other forms of energy such as solar power and gas. A home solar system comprises solar panels, a controller, battery and an inverter. All these work as a team in efficiently supplying power in a household. Solar power has also been adopted by most healthcare facilities such as clinics, hospitals and laboratories that ought to have machines continuously running and lighting. Engineer Thulani Moyo who runs Thulasiso Electrical Engineering company which specialises in solar products said sales were increasing at his firm due to load shedding. <img class="size-full wp-image-632416" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Director-of-Thulasiso-Electrical-Engineering-Engineer-Thulani-Moyo-shows-some-of-the-solar-panels-and-electrical-products-at-his-shop-in-Bulawayo-yesterday.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Director-of-Thulasiso-Electrical-Engineering-Engineer-Thulani-Moyo-shows-some-of-the-solar-panels-and-electrical-products-at-his-shop-in-Bulawayo-yesterday.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Director-of-Thulasiso-Electrical-Engineering-Engineer-Thulani-Moyo-shows-some-of-the-solar-panels-and-electrical-products-at-his-shop-in-Bulawayo-yesterday-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Engineer Thulani Moyo Eng Moyo whose Bulawayo company that operates from the city centre also installs solar systems said their customers are both from urban and rural areas. He said solar power is clean energy as it is environmentally friendly. “Solar product sales are largely increasing because of the load shedding phase. I used to have part time workers but as a result of these good days, they now work full time. “A wide spectrum of people is accommodated in our solar products, be it people from rural areas, farmers, common or special people, the rich and the poor,” Eng Moyo said. <img class="size-full wp-image-631828" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/today18-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/today18-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/today18-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Solar powered house He said prices are really not an issue because it depends on what solar system one wants, depending on what he affords. Eng Moyo said solar power installation should be practised after one gains engineering training to avoid dangers such as electrocution. Mr Khululekani Mpofu, a Luveve suburb resident said he has resorted to using solar power for house appliances such as the refrigerator, television and lights. He also said that he uses a gas stove since the solar system he has cannot power a stove.  “It is a need for one to have alternatives during such power cuts because that is the only way one can survive”, said “I sometimes do not even notice how bad these power cuts are because of these alternatives that I have opted for.” Mr Muziwandile Dube who sells firewood in Emakhandeni said that business is low because people are not buying firewood in large numbers as before during the load shedding period. He said this is because they are using other alternatives such as solar power. <img class="wp-image-567930 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Min-Soda-Zhemu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Min-Soda-Zhemu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Min-Soda-Zhemu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Soda Zhemu Last week, Energy and Power Development Minister Zhemu Soda said the country will import more electricity as a short-term measure to lessen the impact of power outages while the country waits for the results of medium to long-term projects being undertaken such as the expansion at Hwange Power Station.
