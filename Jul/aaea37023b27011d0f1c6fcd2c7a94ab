It is after deliberations we came to the decision.  We have partners and even though we make decisions, it is out of respect that we take the advice we are getting that we cannot take a risk (to host the tournament) and so that is why we have made the necessary announcement today (Sunday). “It is not good for African football to play a tournament that can be washed out. It is not good for Africa and the continent at large and so we have to postpone it.” Motsepe, however, lauded Ivory Coast for the preparations they have already put in to stage the tournament. “I am happy and impressed with the infrastructure put in place by Ivory Coast in readiness for the tournament and I am sure they will host a very good tournament,” Motsepe continued. After the final vote at the Caf Executive Committee meeting on September 20, 2014, the African body announced the hosts for 2019, 2021, and 2023 Afcon tournaments, initially awarding 2019 to Cameroon, 2021 to the Ivory Coast, and 2023 to Guinea. The last edition of the Afcon was held in Cameroon where Senegal emerged the winners after defeating Egypt on penalties in the final. Originally the tournament was scheduled to be played from April 4-25, 2020. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 However, Caf announced on March 17, 2020, that the tournament had been postponed to a later date due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
