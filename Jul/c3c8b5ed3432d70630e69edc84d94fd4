Chicken Inn, who were unconvincing the entire match, could have scored the first in the 10th minute but Brian Muza’s shot hit the upright post. Tenax, who enjoyed ferocious support from the partisan crowd, scored the only goal in the 24th minute when Panashe Mutasa released a through pass to Lyvine Gwenzi who turned and crossed inside the box and burly forward Marlvern Dumbura headed to Mutasa who beat Donovan Bernard, in goals for Chicken Inn. There were no meaningful attacks made by either sides in both halves and Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas admitted that his troops did not do enough to claim victory.  He, however, feels there are still more games for his side to fight for the coveted championship title. “We did not play well enough today and we conceded a goal we could have prevented because of poor marking. We tried to make a comeback but we failed to because of the pitch. It’s a bad day in the office but we live to fight for another day. “The points we are dropping we should be picking them and it’s now difficult for us but we are still hopeful (of the title) as they are still more games ahead. We should not be worried too much about the championship but our form and start winning our games,” Antipas said. Tenax coach Shadreck Mugurasawe was pleased with the result, acknowledging that it is vital in their relegation fight. “I am very happy about the result. The boys played according to instructions and produced the result which will help us to fight relegation. The players are gaining confidence with each passing game. “We were are playing our first time at Vengere but the support was overwhelming and we will liaise with our superiors that we make Vengere our permanent home ground,” said Mugurasawe.
