The Chronicle Lovemore Kadzura in Rusape
Tenax CS FC  0 – 2 Bulawayo Chiefs TWO goals in each half were enough for Bulawayo Chiefs to dismiss relegation-threatened Tenax CS in a match played at Vengere Stadium yesterday. Chiefs’ win was impressive considering that they were missing key players Perfect Chikwende, Kelvin Madzongwe and the Moyo twins Elvis and Kelvin. <img class="wp-image-630997 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Perfect Chikwende The Bulawayo side were the first to settle down forcing the prison warders to spend much time defending in the early stages of the match. The defending was abortive as slippery forward Obriel Chirinda registered his name on the score sheet in the fourth minute when he rounded his marker before shooting past Philip Makumi. Tenax forward Malvern Dumbura had an opportunity to equalise in the 29th minute when he had a face to face encounter with Matripples Muleya who did well to block his shot. Chirinda, on 35 minutes, had his dangerous shot spilled by Makumi and his teammates were slow to react to the loose ball and allowed Tenax to recover. In the second half Tenax tried to come back but were poor in the final third and failed to penetrate the Chiefs defence. The home side won a number of corner kicks and free kicks in good positions but could not utilise their chances. In the 60th minute Arthur Musiwa hit a powerful shot inside the Tenax box and Makumi flexed his muscle to punch the ball for a corner. <img class="wp-image-631003 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Farawu Matare Musiwa in the 75th minute, after beautiful interplay with Farawu Matare and Hugue Chikosha, powered a shot past Makumi to give the visitors a comfortable lead. Shadreck Magurasave believes the prison warders can still survive the relegation. “We played well but our defence let us down today. We failed to mark them and gifted them two soft goals and I am very disappointed. The games are still there for us to recover and we cannot throw in the towel now. We will survive, said Magurasave. Chiefs Portuguese coach Nilton Terroso was happy with the win but described the match as tough.  “I am happy with the win considering that it was a difficult game for us. Tenax were well structured and had a clear way of playing the game. Credit to my boys for the execution of our strategy and we deserved to win,” he said.
