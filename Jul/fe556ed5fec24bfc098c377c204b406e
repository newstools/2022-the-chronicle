THERE will be increased load shedding countrywide, the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) has warned. Most Bulawayo suburbs had already started experiencing longer load shedding hours of up to 24 hours especially in the Western suburbs. In a notice to customers, the power utility said: “The Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) would like to advise its valued customers countrywide that there will be increased load curtailment from the 13th of July 2022. <img class="size-full wp-image-541069" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZETDC This is due to depressed local power generation coupled by increased electricity demand in winter and power import constraints,” read the notice. ZETDC advised customers to use electricity sparingly and to always switch off electrical appliances when not in use. The parastatal’s spokesperson Mr Prosper Mutswiri apologised to members of the public for the inconvenience to consumers. He said engineers were seized with the problem. “Our engineers are still working round the clock to ensure full restoration of service,” he said. In a separate notice that was issued on July 1, the power utility linked power cuts to delayed resolution of faults in some areas.  “We are experiencing a high number of faults due to increased cases of vandalism and inclement weather,’ read the July 1 notice. In the past months thieves have wreaked havoc in Bulawayo, targeting ZETDC copper cables and transformers, plunging suburbs into darkness for days or months on end. Suburbs such as Kingsdale, Famona, Hillcrest and Hillside were the worst affected. The power outages are happening at a time when ZETDC has procured 100 000 prepaid meters as it targets to complete the placement of all customers under this system by June next year. The power utility said due to the prepaid electricity system, the country is saving 123 megawatts (MW) annually. Therefore, the installation for all will likely reduce load curtailments.
