Taking advantage of the marathon, DJ Fatso, who is reveling on a huge response to the silent disco concert he introduced early this year, lined up a number of shows either side of the marathon to add fun to visitors. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623572 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Econet-marathon-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Econet-marathon-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Econet-marathon-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marathon participants usually sample a number of activities before and after the event and the silent disco was a hit with yesterday’s sunset cruise also playing popular. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623578 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Econet-marathon-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Econet-marathon-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Econet-marathon-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> As for the Big 3 Music Show, entry will be free with Djembe Monks, Enzo Ishall, Judgement Yard, Andrea the Vocalist and local DJs set to entertain people. – @ncubeleon
