THE Continuous Assessment Learning Activities (CALA) is valid for two years and those who might have failed their written examinations last year can still use them if they repeat this year. CALA is a student continuous assessment method that was implemented from the November 2021 session Zimsec examinations. <img class="wp-image-472176 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/zimsec1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/zimsec1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/zimsec1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimsec CALA includes learning activities, projects or assessments that require learners to perform, and demonstrate their knowledge, understanding and proficiency. The framework is implemented for Grade 7, Form 4 and Upper 6, 2021 candidates. The programme is part of the 2015 adopted new curriculum but had been shelved because of a lack of resources among other challenges. Last year, Zimsec candidates sat for their first examinations with CALA marks that consist of 30 percent of the final total for pupils. The Minister of Primary and Secondary Education spokesperson Mr Taungana Ndoro said CALA marks are valid for another year.  “The CALA results are valid for two years. So, they can rewrite if they fail their written examinations and the CALA that they got last year they can use this year and next year again. If you are a private candidate, you then pay an administration fee at the school of your choice to rewrite and also the examination fee,” said Mr Ndoro. He said there was no standard price and private candidate can choose, where exactly they want to do CALA. <img class="alignnone wp-image-629581 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Mr Ndoro said most candidates passed CALAs last year, but those who failed have to redo them again as private candidates. He said those who wish to write examinations now have to complete CALA first. “If you haven’t done CALA before, you have to register with an institution as a private candidate. You then do it with the school that you have chosen that has CALA moderators who are teachers. Thereafter you get a CALA mark and then write the final examination as a private candidate,” said Mr Ndoro. Under the regime, Zimsec candidates’ physical and behavioural skills are assessed continuously (coursework) to contribute 30 percent to their final marks. Summative or knowledge skills assessed during examinations contribute 70 percent to the candidate’s final grade.
