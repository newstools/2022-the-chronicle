The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
WHEN the late Dennis Mabhotsha Nkomo and Elliot Ncube formed the all-male Umkhankaso Wamajaha in 1987, the goal was to create a source of living for the imbube group members and ensure it remained intact forever. <img class="wp-image-620572 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-384.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-384.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-384-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Black Umfolosi Nkomo, a former member of Black Umfolosi, assembled a group of Victoria Falls’ Mosi-oa-Tunya High School leavers who were struggling to get jobs in the tourism industry, then the only economic sector in the resort city, to establish Umkhankaso Wamajaha. This was the first imbube and traditional dance group in the tourism city which now has more than a dozen groups. Thirty-five years later, Nkomo, Khalila Nyoni, Xolisani Nyoni, Vusumuzi Ncube, Laiton Ndlovu, Blessing Ncube and Laveck are now late. Eliot Ncube, Clifford Ncube, Siduduzo Ndlovu, Calvet Nkomo, Chief Ndebele, Lungisani Moyo, Thokozani Dube, Samuel Sithole and Nephat Ncube are the surviving band members. Khawulani Ncube, Khangelani Mlotshwa, Michael H Tshuma, Jacob Sithole, Dingani Ncube, Richard Zulu, Elfas Ncube, Clayton Lusaba, Bongani Ndlovu, Ocean Kasiya and Kennedy Madzimbamuto are the new members that joined along the way and complete the full list of the group that has remained an all male band. The group’s spokesperson Chief Ndebele said Umkhankaso Wamajaha has a single 11-track album, Zimi Manzonzo, that was recorded at Moonlight Studios in Bulawayo. <img class="wp-image-623806 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mosi-oa-Tunya-High-School.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mosi-oa-Tunya-High-School.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mosi-oa-Tunya-High-School-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mosi-oa-Tunya High School “Umkhankaso Wamajaha was established in 1987 in Victoria Falls by school leavers from Mosi-oa-Tunya High School. The aim was to get employment through being engaged to perform at hotels,” said Ndebele. He said they were the first group in Victoria Falls to do imbube and traditional Zulu dances. The group has only male dancers and was named Umkhankaso Wamajaha because of the fear that female members would leave the group one day through marriage. Ndebele said their first contract was with Victoria Falls Hotel in 1991 and they went on to be resident performers at A’zambezi River Hotel and Victoria Falls Safari Lodge.  Victoria Falls is well-known for imbube and traditional dance groups that perform for tourists at ports of entry, hotel entrances and at corporate events. Few record albums or organise live shows. Speaking after the recently held National Languages Conference in Victoria Falls where the group was one of the entertainers, Ndebele said the economic situation in the country has affected the group. To try and make ends meet, he said most of their members are now employed by different companies in the city. “We aren’t getting much from hotels now and many of the members had to look for jobs in the hotels and companies involved in construction,” said Ndebele. Commenting on the indigenous languages conference, Dube said the Government’s drive to prioritise the languages brings hope to traditional dance groups. “The aim of this meeting was to revive culture and values for us to know who we are as Zimbabweans. We were lost because when you can’t speak the English language, you’re viewed as uneducated yet our forefathers led successful lives communicating in indigenous languages before the coming of the western culture. “Language, dance and music embody culture and we hope by investing in our cultural heritage, we’ll create jobs for the arts sector,” he said. – @ncubeleon
