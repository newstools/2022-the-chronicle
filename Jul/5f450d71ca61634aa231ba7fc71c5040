PRESIDENT Mnangagwa says Zimbabwe should have state-of-the-art medical facilities just like South Africa, which saved his life after he was poisoned during a rally in 2017. Relieving his 2017 Gwanda rally poisoning incident during a meeting with the business community in Kwekwe yesterday, President Mnangagwa said the medical treatment that saved his life after being airlifted to South Africa inspired his philosophy that a country can only be built by its own citizens. Since the coming in of the Second Republic in November 2017, President Mnangagwa’s Government has been rallying Zimbabweans to unite and work together for the betterment of the country. He told delegates the Second Republic has been working on revamping all sectors of the economy including the health sector. <img class="size-full wp-image-628411" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/KWEKWE-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/KWEKWE-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/KWEKWE-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kwekwe business people follow proceedings during a meeting with President Mnangagwa yesterday. “Most of you would remember that in August 2017 I had an incident of poisoning in Gwanda and I was airlifted to Gweru. “Then Vice-President Chiwenga came and picked me up, airlifting me to South Africa. In South Africa I was exposed to some expert medical attention and that is when I made a decision that this kind of medical technology should also be there in Zimbabwe. I had no idea then that they were going to fire me from the party,” said President Mnangagwa. He said the medical treatment that he received in South Africa inspired his vision for Zimbabwe’s health delivery system, which he was now advocating for. The President said Zimbabwe was for Zimbabweans, hence the Second Republic was determined to turn the country into a jewel albeit with some painful austerity measures that might hurt Zimbabweans but temporarily. He said the journey towards a sound health system had started with the opening of a state-of-the-art National Pathology and Diagnostic Research Centre in the Midlands yesterday. <img class="size-full wp-image-628396" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/MSU1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/MSU1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/MSU1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa address at Midlands States University “So, last year after putting resources together, I challenged the Midlands State University to create a state-of-the-art medical centre in pathology and diagnostic research and today I had the privilege to commission such a huge facility. It’s set to be the best medical research centre in the region,” he said. The President said what was pleasing was that among those running the research centre were young ladies with sharp brains. “The machinery there is being operated by young ladies, our girl child excelling and it’s pleasing,” he said. The President said Zimbabwe was on a recovery path under the Second Republic.  He challenged Zimbabweans to be vigilant and work as a unit to forego the illegal sanctions imposed on the country. “So, under the Second Republic, we said ‘nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, we must not continue to cry and mourn about the illegal sanctions that were imposed on us. We must look at what God has given us and take advantage of that. Whatever we eat we must be able to produce, whatever we wear we must be able to produce as well,” said the President.
