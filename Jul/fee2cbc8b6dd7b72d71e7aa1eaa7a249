The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter LOCAL ensemble, Sunduza Dance Theatre group is set to shine spotlight on tourism with new theatre musical production The Other Cecil which is set to be staged on 17 and 18 August at the Bulawayo Theatre. In 2015, news of the killing of Cecil the Lion at the hands of an American dentist outside a national park in Zimbabwe made international headlines. Seven years later, Cecil the Lion’s story has inspired the musical. Producer and script writer of the musical, Philip Weiss told Chronicle Showbiz that the production is, “a reflection on the cultural issues that the idea of calling a lion Cecil presented.” “Though my background is in environmental education and publishing in Zimbabwe, this production is a reflection on the cultural issues that the idea of calling a lion Cecil presented. The legacy of Cecil Rhodes has also been heavily debated especially in former countries of the British Empire. With the empire came national parks and game reserves and a change in land use management,” said Weiss.  “So, the controversy stirred by the death of a lion named Cecil in Hwange in July 2015 raised some interesting questions. Not all questions are environmental but rather cultural. It is the latter question this new musical in part seeks to explore.” Weiss said the play would portray Zimbabwe’s rich heritage. “Who is the resource base managed by and for whom? For which generation? Zimbabwe is unique with a heritage to protect but how is this reflected internationally? “Though the script provided a structure, it is very much the collective voice of the artistes involved – a vehicle for the music and their ideas about how to relate to the environment,” he said. The environmental books author added that The Other Cecil will serve as a tutor to youths in appreciating wildlife. <img class="wp-image-631717 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-4-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-4-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-4-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> wildlife “We aim to educate, provoke and entertain. Young people brought up in urban areas often have no chance of being exposed to wild animals or national parks, so we hope the show will provoke thought about the ecosystem. We hope to collaborate with schools through Amasiko Lemvelo based in Pumula. Then also with wildlife societies and to tour the production internationally after it has been evaluated, “ said Weiss. On the production which has been in the pipeline for three years, Sunduza Dance Theatre worked with different designers. These include Mdue, a costume designer from Exclusive Clothing, graphic designer Larrington Mudare from Stickyzw, masks designer Mehluli Mzizi and also photography being done by Prince Msipa from Veins Media. The musical and artistic direction is credited to the whole team with special mention given to artistic director Charles Banda and choreographer Mkhululi Khanye. The principal cast includes Charles Banda, Mkhululi Khanye, Khalipani Ndlovu, Baphi Mdladla, Lyndah Sibanda (Sonkomose), Brilliant Ntando Sithole, Memory Moyo, Progress Keswa, and Clan Moyo. After the two-day launch, Sunduza Dance Theatre will head to Harare for the Mitambo Theatre Festival in September and hopefully, go to Masvingo, Mutare and the National Arts Festival in South Africa in 2023. The group has survived 36 years in the arts sector enjoying considerable success, touring different nations such as Singapore, Canada, Switzerland and South Africa performing theatre productions like Matata, Voices from the Rocks, Injabulo, Adventures of Robert Moffat and imbube concerts. – @eMKlass_49
