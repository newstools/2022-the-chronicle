The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief
PRESIDENT Mnangagwa is set to officially commission a state–of-the-art Midlands State University (MSU) National Pathology Research and Diagnostic Centre today, eight months after he laid the foundation stone for the construction of the centre. The facility would be the biggest diseases and biospecimen research centre in the country. Last year, President Mnangagwa laid the foundation stone for the construction of the National Pathology Research and Diagnostic Centre where he emphasised the Second Republic’s new approach of transforming institutions of higher and tertiary education as the gateway to research and innovation through the establishment of innovation hubs and incubation centres. The Pathology Research and Diagnostic Centre comes at an opportune time with regards to the provision of affordable laboratory medicine and the ongoing quest to achieve universal health coverage. <img class="size-full wp-image-621817" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Larry Mavima, said the Second Republic continues to score success stories with the new research centre set to be the citadel of research-based knowledge. “There is no going back, the Second Republic led by the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa has been posting major success stories, especially in line with the President’s vision that no one should be left behind. We are in the right direction and Vision 2030 is becoming a reality day by day,” he said. Minister Mavima said the country has witnessed massive infrastructural development under the Second Republic with the Midlands province recording its own success stories. <img class="size-full wp-image-588326" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-46.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-46.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-46-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Larry Mavima “We will be witnessing the commissioning of yet another success story for our province as we will become home to a national bio and specimen research centre,” he said. “The infrastructure, facilities and innovations taking place under the Second Republic resonate with Goal Nine of the Sustainable Development Goals. “They also speak to Goal Four of the African Union (AU)’s Agenda 2063 on transformed economies, realised through science, technology and innovation-driven manufacturing, industrialisation and value addition.” The Second Republic has been implementing bold programmes of national economic reconstruction and social transformation to create national wealth and lift millions into prosperity.  The Government had prioritised developing educational capabilities to catapult science, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, under the heritage-based Education 5.0 philosophy. The development of any society is often associated with the quality of its higher education hence universities, polytechnics and technological institutions, now have a more pronounced relevance to the competitiveness of the economy as well as to the improvement in the quality of life of people.
