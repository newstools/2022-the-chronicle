The Chronicle Yvonne Ncube, Showbiz Correspondent THE Springs Feelings concert will return this September in Bulawayo to celebrate the underappreciated jazz music, following a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19. The third edition will be headlined by South Africa’s award-winning jazz saxophonist McCoy Mrubata on September 3. Organised by Big Scale Promotions, this year’s edition will be held at Country Side resort. At a press briefing yesterday, McCoy said he is pleased to come to Zimbabwe for the third time. “It is quite an honour that I will be coming to bless the beautiful people of Zimbabwe, Bulawayo in particular with good jazz music. This will be my third time,” he said, during a brief telephone interview. <img class="wp-image-617377 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-30-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Oliver Mtukudzi One of the organisers Prince Tshabalala said they are pleased to bring back the event after Covid-19 disruptions. “We launched the Spring Feelings Jazz concert in 2018 with the late Oliver Mtukudzi and Bekezela at the large City hall and that was Mtukudzi’s last show in Bulawayo, we are proud to have hosted him. The Spring Feelings concert is a crossover from the winter season where people pack away their long coats and heavy jerseys and move over to summer clothing. The idea behind the spring feelings was to allow jazz lovers to go out and celebrate jazz music complemented by the beautiful weather,” said Tshabalala. He said apart from headliner McCoy Mrubata, will be supported by top local artistes.  “We have put together some of Bulawayo’s cream. They will be led by Hudson Simbarashe. Qeqe will also be part of the supporting artists. There is going to be an after-party but the venue is still being organised,” he said. Tshabalala said jazz music is underrated unlike other genres. “One thing that I have realised is that when people talk about Jazz music they think it is that lousy kind of music but I assure that those who attend on the September 3 everyone one is going to be on their feet dancing,” said Tshabalala. <img class="wp-image-486472 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Prince-Tshabalala.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Prince-Tshabalala.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Prince-Tshabalala-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prince Tshabalala He added that from the first day, there will be a tour of Bulawayo to promote the festival, before the show in the evening. “Sunday we will be going all over Bulawayo showing people what we mean about Jazz music. We will also show them the jazz and jacket dance as a means of promoting jazz. We have no specific places that we are going to be going but we will randomly be visiting places in locations,” Tshabalala said. – @SeehYvonne
