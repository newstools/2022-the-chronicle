All other statements emanating from sources other than the ones mentioned above should not be regarded as the official position of the family or his close associates,” he said. Ruwende urged members of the public to desist from raising unwarranted alarm over his health condition.  “Meanwhile, the NACZ would like to urge players in the sector and the public to exercise restraint and desist from communicating private family matters on public platforms. The NACZ implores practitioners not to abuse the social media space to communicate false and unverified information following the events of the past two days where players have been communicating about the health of Nama legend Cont Mhlanga. “Members of the public should disregard any messages circulating on social media purporting to be representing his family and seeking financial assistance for his medical treatment. The Mhlanga family is grateful for the words of encouragement and prayers and appreciates the love that has been shown by practitioners in the CCIs and members of the public during this period,” he said.
