THE Joshua Nkomo family says July 1 evokes painful emotions and memories as it reflects on the life of Father Zimbabwe, who died on this day 23 years ago. The veteran nationalist died at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals after battling prostate cancer at the age 82. His legacy of peace and unity remains alive to many Zimbabweans and the Government has committed to implementing some of his policy ideas. <img class="size-full wp-image-623062" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Parirenyatwa-Group-of-Hospitals.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Parirenyatwa-Group-of-Hospitals.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Parirenyatwa-Group-of-Hospitals-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals In an interview yesterday, the late Dr Nkomo’s daughter, Mrs Thandi-Nkomo Ebrahim, said in remembering their father, they were fully cognisant of his bravery and life of sacrifice and service to Zimbabwe. “July 1 is always a painful day to reflect on as we remember this great man who did everything for the liberation of the country. “We remember a man who had a goal to liberate the country and accomplished his dream of liberating the country,” she said.
“This was one of his proud moments that even when he died, he knew that the country was liberated.” Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim said the sacrifices made by “Big Josh” to liberate the country cost the family dearly as it suffered painful experiences, which were felt more by their late mother, Johanna Fuyana-Nkomo, who married a career politician. She said Dr Nkomo sacrificed a lot to liberate the country but did not take that as an opportunity for personal material enrichment and that of his family and relatives. The family is happy with what he stood for and his enduring legacy. <img class="size-full wp-image-623068" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/fe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/fe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/fe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Johanna Fuyana-Nkomo “When people look at us as the Nkomo family, some of them are surprised that despite belonging to the family of such a great man, we have nothing to show for it. “I might have gone to school and acquired some degrees but some of our relatives are struggling and this surprises a lot of people,” she said. “Because when they think of politicians, they think of people who drive shiny cars and who have it all. We are despised as a family but as his children and the older relatives know what he stood for and have to honour his legacy,” said Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim. She recounted her father’s last days when he was admitted at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare as one of the most difficult times of his life. In line with hospital policy, there were restrictions on the number of people who could visit him but this did not go well with Dr Nkomo, she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-466014" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Parirenyatwa-Hospital-in-Harare.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Parirenyatwa-Hospital-in-Harare.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Parirenyatwa-Hospital-in-Harare-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Parirenyatwa Hospital “So, he kept asking where are the people? Are they not aware that I’m admitted at a hospital? Why are people not coming to see me? “But doctors couldn’t allow just anyone to come and see him. The ward where he was admitted was cordoned and security was deployed but they had created a separate room for my mother who was with him during the one to two weeks where he was admitted at the hospital,” said Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim. “But one of the things he was happy about even on his deathbed is that he was treated locally even when he was critical. He never wished to be taken abroad or dying abroad,” she said. Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim said Father Zimbabwe founded Ekusileni Medical Centre upon realising the need to have specialist hospitals in the country that will prevent citizens from seeking medical treatment out of the country. <img class="size-full wp-image-606501" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/eku.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/eku.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/eku-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ekusileni Medical Centre She said Dr Nkomo was of the conviction that when someone is ill they need to be surrounded by loved ones but when someone is out of the country this is not possible. “So, he engaged the National Social Security Authority and was the one who looked for the land and was part of the process that identified the land where Ekusileni Medical Centre is located. “His vision was that Ekusileni should not have been the only specialist hospital but each of the country’s provinces should have its specialist hospital as opposed to having people travelling outside the country to access specialist medical treatment,” she said. Father Zimbabwe’s daughter said the transformation of Zimbabwean hospitals was supposed to be undertaken under Zimbabwe Health Care Trust. Government has since moved to fulfil Dr Nkomo’s dream as Ekusileni Medical Centre will be a specialist training and research hospital administered by the National University of Science and Technology post Covid-19. Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim said the family is also concerned over claims that Dr Nkomo sold out during the 1987 Unity Accord negotiations, which ended the Gukurahundi episode and led to the unity of Zanu-PF and PF Zapu. Some social media users have been pushing a narrative that Dr Nkomo should not have signed the Unity Accord describing the unity move as ‘selling out.’ <img class="size-full wp-image-556926" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo “We have seen those claims and we wonder what was there to gain if he didn’t sign the Unity Accord. He chose peace over war and this has always been part of his legacy to promote peace over conflicts,” said Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim. “He believed that if people are in peace, they were better placed to fight to improve their lives. Even if we look at the liberation struggle, he initially chose a diplomatic approach over war and war was the last resort as he preferred negotiations over war. “But the Smith regime was relentless, forcing him to also consider taking up arms but he had tried to negotiate just like other countries that attained independence without taking up arms,” said Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim. She said Dr Nkomo wanted Zimbabwe to develop hence he remained in active politics even when some of his colleagues were asking him to step down from active politics but he would not tire. Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim said between 1987 and 1999 when he died, Dr Nkomo had advanced several developmental projects that continue to transform lives even today. <img class="size-full wp-image-555304" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/nkomo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/nkomo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/nkomo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo She said Father Zimbabwe never believed that any difference could have led to Gukurahundi hence his statement that he “never thought a country could be free without its people being free” and he learnt this late in his life. Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim said more needs to be done to recognise the works that Father Zimbabwe did for the country as his legacy touched many across Zimbabwe. She also said there is a need to erect the second statue that was made for Dr Nkomo in Harare. “There are two statues that were made in honour of Dr Nkomo, the other one has been mounted in Bulawayo but the second one is yet to be installed. “We call on the Government to erect the statue in Harare as was planned. This is also in sync with the fact Dr Nkomo was not a regional leader but a national leader,” said Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim. “We also support the call to declare July 1 a national holiday because how do we honour someone with the title Father of a Nation and fail to set aside a day to honour him,” she said. Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim said the family and Joshua Nkomo Legacy Trust also recognises the commitments that Government is putting to honour Father Zimbabwe although some of the measures are yet to be implemented. She said Dr Nkomo should be remembered for his selfless endeavours for peace, unity and justice for everyone. -@nqotshili
