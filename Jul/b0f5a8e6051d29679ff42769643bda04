The bulk of the capital expenditure was on refurbishment of stores and the opening of new ones. Two new stores namely OK Banket and OK Mart Chivhu, were opened in the second half of the financial year and are expected to contribute meaningfully in the coming years. “Refurbishment of stores remains a central part of the Group’s strategy of regularly refreshing our facilities and ambience, which subsequently improves the equity of our store brands. Refurbishments were completed at OK Masvingo, OK Chinhoyi, Bon Marché Avondale, OK Mbare and OK Queensdale,” it said.  Growth was sustained in value-added services with forex earnings supported through the expansion of the domestic remittance service across stores. This was despite the negative impact on customer count due to tariff and premium increases on the back of declining disposable incomes, it added. Overheads grew by 37 percent over the prior year and staff costs, electricity charges, rentals, bank charges and depreciation contributed most significantly to overheads growth.
