The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Lupane
FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD physically challenged Lweendo Mudenda from Binga struggles to hide her bitterness as she narrates how her father rejected her at birth after seeing that she was disabled. Her father, Mr Naison Munsaka of Kalungwizi in Binga, reportedly abandoned Lweendo’s mother Ms Samariya Mudenda because she had given birth to a disabled child. Life was not rosy for Lweendo and her three older siblings as their mother struggled to fend for them. Lweendo was born with a boneless left leg which resulted in doctors amputating her below the knee. Through the help of well-wishers, Lweendo managed to get an artificial leg and would walk 14 kilometres to and from Kalungwizi Primary School where she did her primary education and got 27 units at Grade 7 last year. She is one of the 39 youths from Binga that benefited from the Presidential Scholarship being implemented by Zanu-PF through the Zimbabwe Foundation for Education with Production (ZIMFEP). <img class="wp-image-624268 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF ZIMFEP is a department under the portfolio of Dr Joram Gumbo, the party’s Secretary for Education. Dr Gumbo visited Fatima High School in Lupane last week. Binga district is the biggest beneficiary with 39 learners, 24 at Fatima High and 15 at Mupfure Vocational College in Chegutu. The visit by Dr Gumbo was to welcome the Form One to Five learners and also to hand over a two-tonne truck donated by ZIMFEP to the school as well as two tonnes of maize donated to Fatima by a sister school, Rusununguko, which is also a ZIMFEP institution. Lweendo is doing Form One and said while she is still bitter about rejection by her biological father, the scholarship brought some hope to her life as she has an opportunity to shape her future. “My father left us when I was an infant. He abandoned my mother because she had given birth to me, a disabled child. I was angry when I was told this and I am still bitter because my mother is struggling to fend for us,” she said. Lweendo said her father doesn’t do anything for them and it’s like he doesn’t exist. “I thank President Mnangagwa for restoring my hope in life through this scholarship,” she said. Lweendo said she wants to be a medical doctor and will work hard to pass. She said she will work in her district as a way of helping her own community. Another beneficiary, Solani Siabulimo (18) who is doing Lower Sixth said he will honour President Mnangagwa by dedicating his service to Binga. Solani of Siabuwa passed eight subjects at O-level at Mosi-oa-Tunya High School in Victoria Falls and is doing sciences at Fatima High. <img class="wp-image-626518 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-58-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-58-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-58-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Solani Siabulimo “My elder brothers were paying my school fees and I was almost heartbroken when they could no longer afford. I am grateful to President Mnangagwa for the scholarship and I promise to work hard and become a responsible citizen. I am proud of our President and wish we could have such leaders for years to come,” said Solani. Binga is one of the districts that have been lagging behind in terms of development and opportunities across all economic sectors. Government is implementing various programmes aimed at ensuring all parts of the country and all citizens are not left behind as it works to attain an upper middle-income society by 2030. Ms Asah Munsaka (25) from Lusulu under Chief Siansali said she had almost lost hope of proceeding to tertiary education because of lack of funds. She passed her O-level with five subjects and her parents had been failing to raise fees for her to further her studies. She is now doing a two-year course in electrical installation at Mupfure College. “They are providing us with everything from school fees to safety clothing and I would want to thank President Mnangagwa for what he has done for us. After completing my studies, I want to work hard and show my community in Lusulu the benefits of the Second Republic’s support. I want people to embrace these opportunities and not restrict their children to the home,” said Munsaka. She is one of the female students in the group that is due for attachment in December.  Her college mate Mr Given Munkombwe from Chief Kavula area who said he was an orphan, said his vision was to open a company in Binga to employ other youths. “I am doing electrical installation and I want all young people to see the good things Government has done for us,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the 17 Binga chiefs, Chief Saba implored the beneficiaries to uphold cultural values and morals. He urged them to return and work in Binga after completing their studies. Chief Saba said the whole district was grateful to the Government for providing its children with such opportunities. Dr Gumbo said the ruling party was committed to making sure areas that were previously marginalised benefit from Government programmes. “My coming here was to donate a truck given to Fatima by ZIMFEP as well as welcome learners from Binga. “Our idea as the Second Republic through the ruling party’s education for production policy, is to make sure that no one is left behind. We want ZIMFEP school to be self-sufficient through income generating projects “These scholarships will be there every year as we want all the less-privileged children to benefit,” said Dr Gumbo. – @ncubeleon
