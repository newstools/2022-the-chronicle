The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
ZIMBABWE has had a fair share of visually-impaired artistes who have made big names in the music and arts industry. Household names that quickly come to one’s mind include the late Tsholotsho-born Fanyana Dube, South African musician and lawyer Steve Kekana who was inspired by visually-impaired American singer Stevie Wonder, the late Lazarus Kgagudi of the popular Ngembese Dali Kuyagodola song, and locals Paul Matavire and Chamunorwa Nebeta, also late. <img class="wp-image-627325 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-39-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-39-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-39-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Steve Kekana Other names include Tafirenyika Dube and Gertrude Munodawafa from the streets of Bulawayo, John Madubeko of Gweru, and Themba ‘‘Boyoyo’’ Mathe, a former frontman of Mokis Connection who became blind in 2014. Now, there is a visually-impaired music star rising from rural Binga. Oscar Sibanda from Lubimbi who is a Form 2 student at Fatima High School believes he will be part of the next generation of blind musicians. Last Friday, Sibanda performed in front of a delegation from Zimbabwe Foundation for Education with Production (Z ) at his school. He said he penned the song a week before the event and dedicated it to his school. Interestingly, he has two singles that he recorded when he was doing Form One at Copota School for the Blind in Masvingo where he learnt before transferring to Fatima. <img class="wp-image-627334 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Souljah Love He started Grade One in 2010 and is only doing Form Two now at the age of 19 because he missed school for some time. With support, Sibanda can truly add to the list of the few visually impaired singers in the country as he believes his talent is in music. Scores of delegates that were at Fatima last Friday can attest to it as the youngster left the occasion US$65 richer after people tipped him following his performance that moved them. In an interview, Sibanda said he chose the Zimdancehall genre saying he is inspired by Souljah Love and Killer T. “I started doing music in November 2015 and I have two songs; Ndiyanda Nduwe Mwaami Waangu and Ngilidumisile which I recorded when I was learning at Copota,” said Sibanda. <img class="wp-image-627337 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Alick Macheso He said he transferred from Copota because his mother could not afford to pay his school fees there so he returned to Fatima, where he did his primary education. A non-governmental organisation is now paying his school fees. A classmate at Copota helped him record the two songs on a cellphone using the TalkBack application. He, however, does not have that privilege at Fatima because cellphones are prohibited. Sadly, he is not sure whether the boy whose mobile phone he used to record at Copota, still has the songs.  At Fatima, he is learning six subjects, but he believes his talent is in music instead. “I want to be a musician and I wish I could get someone to help me realise my dream. I know I have the talent and all I need is an opportunity to record and be known worldwide. “My songs come in dreams and I want to record them. Unfortunately, we don’t have a music teacher here to help. I also appeal to the school authorities to allow me access to my phone so that I record each song I dream of because I don’t write them down,” said Sibanda. <img class="wp-image-469098 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Killer-T.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Killer-T.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Killer-T-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Killer T While he chose to sing Zimdancehall, Sibanda said he also loves sungura maestro Alick Macheso and can sing along to most of the songs that he has listened to. Fatima has a facility for disabled learners and uses Braille for the visually impaired. A classmate, Atwell Alexander from Nketa in Bulawayo is Sibanda’s close friend who moves around with him and assists him with most of his duties. “We became friends during the first term as I felt I should help him. Sometimes, he’ll be with Makhosi, a Grade 6 pupil at Fatima primary when I’m not around,” said Atwell. Sibanda is the last born in a family of five. – @ncubeleon
