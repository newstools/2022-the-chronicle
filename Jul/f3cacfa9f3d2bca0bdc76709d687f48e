Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said six suspects entered  premises in Esigodini and stole batteries and oil, loaded them into a truck from the same premises and drove off. “These six robbers tied up a security guard and went on to break the locks to the premises using a grinder which they left at the scene,” said Insp Ncube. The owner of the truck who is based in South Africa managed to determine the location of the truck using the tracker attached to the truck. Police were notified and they managed to intercept the truck along the Bulawayo-Harare road.  There was a high-speed chase on the highway when the suspects noticed the police and made a u- turn. Insp Ncube said the truck driver swerved off the road and the vehicle fell into a ditch. The suspects upon realising that they were stuck abandoned the truck and took to their heels. <img class="wp-image-632371 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> battery “Two suspects who were in the truck managed to escape but the truck was recovered and taken to Bulawayo Central Traffic which is at Drill Hall,” said Insp Ncube.
