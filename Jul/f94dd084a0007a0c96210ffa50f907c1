CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League side Bulawayo City say they are treating each game like a cup final in their bid to escape relegation. City registered two consecutive wins in the 2021/22 Premiership season by claiming the scalps of Manica Diamonds, who they edged 1-0 in Mutare, followed by a 3-1 home win over Whawha. Despite the two wins, City remain rooted second from bottom of the league table with 18 points from 20 games.
Coach Farai Tawachera, who has been in charge of seven City games since the club severed ties with veteran Philani ‘Beefy’ Ncube in May, has collected more points in fewer games than his predecessor in 13 outings. Ncube collected just six points in his 13 games in charge of  City. <img class="wp-image-621895 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-54-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Philani ‘Beefy’ Ncube Under Tawachera, City have hauled 12 points from three wins and three draws. In their next match, City will be at home to Tenax, who are two points above them in 14th place. Tawachera is happy with his charges’ performances and said besides emphasis on taking each game like a cup final, they have managed to build a strong bond between the technical team and players. He believes it is that unity of purpose that will carry them through in their fight for survival.  “Firstly, I would like to give credit to Beefy (Ncube) because he assembled a good team. The emphasis has been the need to survive relegation, with everyone knowing that being relegated means us losing our jobs,” said Tawachera. “The technical team and players know that being relegated doesn’t give a good impression of football in Bulawayo, hence the need to give our all. <img class="wp-image-592917 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Vincent-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Vincent-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Vincent-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vincent Moyo ‘If we are to go down, we will do so with honour, having put up a good fight and that is why we are saying every game is a final. The boys are pushing hard at training and we don’t have boundaries in our camp. “We’re a family and that gives a sense of belonging. Whatever we do, we must achieve as a team,” he said. What gives Tawachera hope in their survival fight is that five points separate them from 11th placed Yadah.
Yadah are on 23 points, followed by Cranborne Bullets on 22, Caps United on 21 and Tenax on 20. Harare City are tied on 19 points with ZPC Kariba, while table anchors Whawha have 15 points. <img class="wp-image-627124 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-18-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-18-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-18-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dominic Jaricha Following the transfer of skipper and central defender Vincent Moyo to Chicken Inn last week, Tawachera converted midfielder Dominic Jaricha to centre-back, partnering Mpumelelo Bhebhe in their victories over Manica Diamonds and Whawha. Jaricha, who is on loan from Bulawayo Chiefs, has easily settled in his new role. Some of the players that have been consistent performers under Tawachera include Lesley Dumo Lunga, who wrestled the right-back position from Lewis Ncube, central midfielders Cedric Chinomona, Welcome Ndiweni and Melikhaya Ncube, as well as Crispen Machisi. The strikers at Tawachera’s disposal include Dalubuhle Dlodlo, Nqobile Ndlovu and Rodi Sibanda, who is on loan from Highlanders. — @ZililoR
