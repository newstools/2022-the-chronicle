Our administrators should be able to attend these courses to keep up with changing trends that affect the sports industry.  “The level of development in sport and recreation is directly linked to skills, technical and administrative competencies within the system. Courses such as this one ensure that there is smooth governance in sport associations, which is what we want in our associations,” said Dzvimbu. He said they were expecting about 40 participants for the training . Each participant is expected to pay a course fee of US$30. Payment will be accepted both in local and forex, but confirmation of the local currency should be done before payment. The course fee must be paid on or before July 19. — @innocentskizoe
