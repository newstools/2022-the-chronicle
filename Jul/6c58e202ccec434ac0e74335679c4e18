Zimbabwe is setting up integrity committees at public institutions as an effective tool to prevent corruption and promote good corporate governance at institutional level. Integrity committees are set up to spearhead the prevention of corruption and promotion of integrity within the institutions’ spheres of control. They are focused on spearheading in-house anti-corruption efforts and enhancing good governance by institutionalising the fight against corruption. In an interview yesterday, Zacc Commissioner John Makamure said institutions should include integrity committees in their respective strategic plans to achieve the best results. “At least 26 public entities have set up integrity committees in compliance with the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission’s directive for institutions to constitute these organs to ensure an internally driven process to arrest the scourge,” he said. Comm Makamure said the Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) was one of the 26 entities that have set up the integrity committees. <img class="wp-image-624190 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) “Zinara is one of the entities that has responded positively to our incessant call to organisations in both public private sectors to establish integrity committees for the prevention of corruption in their institutions,” he said. Comm Makamure said Zacc is determined to see integrity committees established in institutions. “This has been motivated by the need to enhance our corruption prevention drive which lately has witnessed Zacc’s commendable achievements in addressing governance and administrative malpractices at various local government authorities and public entities in the country.” “I encourage other institutions to emulate such commitment to deal with corruption within their areas of authority through establishment of integrity committees,” he said. The establishment of integrity committees has been identified as one of the most effective ways to facilitate stakeholder participation in the anti-corruption drive.  Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia have successfully introduced integrity committees which are producing positive results in the anti-graft fight.
