TEAMS in the Rhino Cup Champions League (RCCL) Iganyana Division played under the Zifa Matabeleland North Area Zone finally received a huge consignment of playing kits and equipment that had been holed up in Germany for one-and-a-half years. All 20 clubs received two sets of full kits each, including socks, boots, playing balls, goal nets, cooler boxes, bibs and cones. The equipment was sourced by Wild and Free Foundation with their local implementing partner Painted Dog Conservation. Wild and Free Foundation representative Kathrin Ehrke said they will continue to support the league. <img class="size-full wp-image-623911" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/w.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/w.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/w-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wild and Free Foundation “We started this league in Mozambique in 2017 and now we have over 1 000 players, both male and female. We are also in Namibia, but now have added Zimbabwe to the list, which is my favourite country. Our goal is to create an environment where wildlife lives in harmony with humans. “We are not just sponsoring you, but also asking you to support us in this journey to have a safer environment for humans and wild life in this area. It has taken us one-and-a-half years with lots of paperwork having to be done and we are glad to have managed to do this,” she said. Guest of honour and newly co-opted Zifa board member Kenneth Mhlophe said: “Football is anchored on goodwill and stakeholder management. The support we receive from our stakeholders strengthens our institution. We are ever grateful to the gesture Wild and Free Foundation and Painted Dog Conservation have extended to the Hwange community, and it is my hope that the community will reciprocate by showing the world what they are capable of doing. Hwange is known for its rich natural resources, among them flora and fauna, which makes it great. As a tourist destination with lots of wildlife, the key to this sponsorship and partnership is conservation.” Mhlophe through his Nokel Security company also pledged to sponsor monthly top goal scorer awards in the league. — @innocentskizoe
