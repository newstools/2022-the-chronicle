MATABELELAND South Province is battling with theileriosis, a cattle disease also known as January Disease which has killed more than 400 beasts in Insiza District since the beginning of the year. The disease which was usually recorded in Mashonaland provinces, Manicaland, Midlands and Masvingo was recorded for the first time in the province in Gwatemba and Lancester Farm in Insiza. Movement of cattle from the affected areas has since been restricted to curb the spread of the disease. Theileriosis is a tick-borne disease caused by a blood protozoan parasite, theileria. The disease is manifested by high fever, enlarged lymph nodes, severe anaemia and death in some infected animals. The theileria parasite infects both red and white blood cells of cattle. <img class="wp-image-629320 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-9-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-9-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-9-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> theileria parasite It reduces oxygen supply in sick cows, causing anaemia and weakness. Theileriosis has been recorded in animals of all ages. Matabeleland South provincial veterinary director, Dr Enat Mdlongwa said they had introduced the 5-5-4 dipping regime system in a bid to contain the disease. <img class="wp-image-629317 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-7-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-7-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-7-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Enat Mdlongwa He said under the dipping system, farmers were supposed to dip their animals after five days, dip them again after five days and then dip them after four days before reverting back to five days. “The situation in Insiza District is worrying as theilerosis is slowly taking its toll. The disease was previously recorded in Mashonaland provinces but we recorded it for the first time in the province in January. We have recorded over 400 deaths in Insiza District since January, which is alarming. We have agreed with farmers that we need to get these animals tested and any animal that comes out positive has to be sold for slaughter and then farmers can use the proceeds to replace their animals,” he said. “We have also introduced the 5-5-4 dipping regime. This dipping system helps kill the stages of the parasite which carries the disease. We are providing farmers with the acaricide chemical to dip their cattle and all the farmers need to do is to pay US$2 dipping fee for each beast for the year.” He said some farmers were, however, not forthcoming to follow the dipping regime which was resulting in death of livestock. Dr Mdlongwa said the provincial veterinary lab which was opened in Gwanda recently was helping them to react timeously to diseases.  He said the lab has over 1 000 samples that are undergoing testing for theilerosis. Dr Mdlongwa said before the lab was opened the province relied on a lab in Harare, which took two to three weeks for results to return. “The lab is playing a critical role in coming up with immediate diagnosis of the diseases so that farmers can take necessary measures to protect their animals. When we were using the lab in Harare we used to get results after two to three weeks and in some cases the animals would have died,” he said. “We collect samples from the field and send them to the provincial lab, the results are out quickly and treatment of the animal is instituted immediately. We urge farmers to take advantage of this service and bring in samples from their animals for testing and then take necessary measures.” — @DubeMatutu
