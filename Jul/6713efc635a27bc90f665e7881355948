The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter GOVERNMENT has granted a waiver for acting Chief Gwebu from Buhera in Manicaland to be allocated an official vehicle and have his home electrified while a borehole will also be drilled in his homestead. Traditional leaders are entitled to official vehicles, electrification of their homes while their homes should have boreholes, but that is not accorded to those occupying the position on an acting capacity. The Gwebu community of Buhera in Manicaland consists of people of Ndebele origin who migrated from Esigodini in 1927. <img class="size-full wp-image-623761" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Buhera-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Buhera-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Buhera-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Acting Chief Gwebu They have maintained their culture for nearly a century since they relocated to Manicaland and they have an acting chief since the heir to the throne is a minor. Local Government and Public Works Deputy Minister Marian Chombo said the Ministry was aware of acting Chief Gwebu’s situation. She said while an acting chief is only entitled to allowances, it was resolved that acting Chief Gwebu be granted full benefits given to other traditional leaders. “Please note that under normal circumstances acting chiefs are not entitled to amenities which are due to substantive chiefs. They only get monthly allowances. However, the Manicaland Provincial Assembly of Chiefs resolved that the above be waived for Regent Chief Gwebu,” she said. “The Provincial Assembly resolved that the Regent Chief be allocated an official vehicle, have access road, electricity and borehole be drilled at his homestead. It was further resolved that the heir be considered for electricity, access road and a borehole.” <img class="size-full wp-image-559770" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Marian-Chombo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Marian-Chombo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Marian-Chombo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Local Government and Public Works Deputy Minister, Marian Chombo Deputy Minister Chombo said including acting Chief Gwebu, Government is targeting to provide 58 traditional chiefs with vehicles. “To date a total of 243 chiefs have been allocated vehicles. The 58 are among the new appointments targeted for 2022. However, the purchase is subject to the release of the funds by Treasury. The allocation of vehicles is based on appointment. By December 2021 all the eligible chiefs had been allocated vehicles,” said Deputy Minister Chombo. She said Government agencies such as the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and District Development Fund are expected to provide electricity, access roads and drill boreholes at chiefs’ homes. In an interview following a Chronicle news crew’s visit to Buhera, acting Chief Gwebu, said he is due to be provided an official vehicle, this is still to take place.  He has served for a decade.  “Well, I have been an acting Chief for the past 10 years and will continue in this capacity for the coming six years since the heir to the chieftaincy is still a minor. So whenever I’m travelling on chiefs’ business I face challenges as I do not have a vehicle. Also, my home has not been electrified and a borehole has not been drilled at my homestead. I think it’s necessary that these facilities be provided so that as a smaller community in this area is not seen to be marginalised,” said acting Chief Gwebu. — @nqotshili
