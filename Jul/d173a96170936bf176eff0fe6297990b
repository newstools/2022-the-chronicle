The accident occurred near the 167km peg along Mvuma–Chivhu road on July 3 around 7.30PM,” he said. Insp Mahoko said Trevor Mabugu (38) of Ruwa in Harare was driving a Toyota Hilux from Mvuma towards Chivhu with no passengers on board. He said there was also Sungai Sibanda (45) of Hertfordshire suburb in Gweru who was driving a silver Toyota Corolla towards Mvuma town.  “It is alleged that upon approaching the 167km peg Sungai Sibanda tried to overtake a haulage truck resulting in a head-on collision with Mabugu’s vehicle, which was going the opposite direction. “As a result of the incident, one passenger from Sungai Sibanda’s vehicle died on spot and was identified as Ernest Chinosengwa of Masvingo. <img class="wp-image-585877 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/acc.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/acc.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/acc-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Accidents – Image taken by Shuttershock Police attended the scene and two injured persons were also rushed to Mvuma District hospital for treatment,” said Insp Mahoko. In the other accident, he said a 36-year-old woman died after the vehicle she was travelling in crashed into a stationary vehicle on the roadside. “The incident occurred on July 2 around 7PM at the 220km peg Harare — Masvingo road. It is alleged that Pepukai Gurai (37) of Masvingo was driving a silver Honda Fit towards Masvingo with four passengers on board,” said Insp Mahoko. He said Gurai allegedly lost control of the vehicle and it veered off the road resulting in the accident. “One passenger Emelda Makanda (36) of Masvingo sustained multiple injuries and was pronounced dead upon arrival at Mvuma District hospital,” said Insp Mahoko. “We take this opportunity to warn drivers on the need to be on the side of caution. Speed thrills but affects the ability to have full control of motor vehicles, leading to road accidents,” he said.
