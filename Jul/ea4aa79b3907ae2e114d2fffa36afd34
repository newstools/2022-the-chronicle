THE automation of services at the new look Beitbridge Border Post has helped address efficiency management systems and bring back some transporters on the Zimbabwean transit route, an official has said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-625090 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-58-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-58-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-58-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimborders Consortium general manager Mr Nqobile Ncube told members of the two parliamentary portfolio committees responsible for Finance and Economic Development and that of Defence, Home Affairs, and Security that the commercial cargo coming through Beitbridge was gradually increasing. The Government and the Zimborders Consortium are modernising the country’s busiest inland port at a cost of US$300 million under a 17 and half year concession. Under the concession, the Government is providing the land and technical support while the consortium is providing funding and civil works. Zimborders will also manage the infrastructure for the duration of the concession before handing it over to the Government. “We have structured the construction works in phases, and we are already done with Phase 1 (freight terminal) and Phase 2 (bus terminal),” said Mr Ncube. Civil works on the last phase; the light vehicles terminal, and the out-of-port works, he said, were underway. “We have made great strides in addressing efficiency issues through the automation of most services and operations,” said Mr Ncube. “This move reduces too much human interface between the border officials and other border users. “So since we launched the freight terminal in October last year, we are handling an average of 800 trucks per day. At its best, the border used to carry about 1 200 commercial trucks daily, and we can surpass that margin if we continue working on upgrading efficiency issues.” The official said traffic had since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic been looking at other less busy ports via Mozambique and Botswana. <img class="wp-image-596024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 He said the separation of traffic into commercial trucks, buses, light vehicles, and pedestrians had contributed to improved border services. Mr Ncube said authorities were now dealing with issues based on each sector’s specific needs. “When we started operating at Phase 1, we were having teething challenges and these have been addressed,” he said.
“Dealing with specific types of traffic helps us to address issues based on specific needs. “In addition to that, together with other border stakeholders, we are targeting to cut the trucks’ stay time at the border to at least three hours by the end of December this year”. Mr Ncube said the turnaround time commercial cargo spends at the borders determines the transporters’ mapping of transit routes. He said upon completion the border will use hi-tech systems including booms, cameras, online clearance processes, drive-in commercial cargo scanners, and baggage scanners for those using the bus and light vehicles’ terminals. Speaking separately, Beitbridge residents said they had started witnessing the positive spillover effects that come with the border modernisation programme. “We are seeing more people visiting the border town due to an efficient border post. This will see more business in the town,” said Beitbridge Town Clerk Mr Loud Ramakgapola. “The standard set in the border upgrade may spin over into setting the standards for infrastructure in the town. “In fact, we are likely to see developers benchmarking against the high standard at the border which would be a positive development for the town”. Miss Eunice Mdau said the town was also getting a facelift and that increased traffic would enhance businesses linked to the movement of cargo and human traffic. “We also expect tourists’ arrivals by road to increase because the delays due to limited operating space were chasing away many travellers. “The ambiance at the border post has drastically improved.  It presents a good image of Zimbabwe to those visiting from South Africa,” she said. Chairman of the local pastors’ fraternal, Pastor Busani Moyo said the Beitbridge project had created a lot of employment for the locals and that a working border will boost the local municipality’s revenue collection capacity from residents and those in transit. The automation of service, he said, lessens corruption, and people will now move faster after being assisted under clearly defined systems. Ms Rumbedzani Ribombo of Dulivhadzimu said she was excited to see improved infrastructure including roads, water facilities, and housing around the town and the border. -@tupeyo
