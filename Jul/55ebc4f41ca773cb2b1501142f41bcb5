SOUTH Africa-based former Highlanders and Caps United winger Gabriel Nyoni is giving away one of his jerseys as a retirement gift to his fans. Nyoni, who was forced into early retirement at the age of 29 after failing to fully recover from a foot injury he suffered last year, said a lucky Twitter follower will get a jersey on condition that no one likes their response. <img class="wp-image-624580 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Twitter “As part of my retirement gift I am giving away one of my jerseys to any lucky winner.
