GWANDA-based dance group Bolamba Performing Arts is pinning hopes on winning its first ever national accolade through the Chibuku Neshamwari Dance Competition. Last month, the group earned a place to represent Matabeleland South province at the national competition after outshining nine other dance outfits from the rainbow province. Bolamba Performing Arts which is from Kafusi village in Gwanda district has two founding members, Africa Mate and Halifeli Ngulube, who were part of the initial Bolamba group before it was rebranded to Bolamba Culture Birds. Through the group, the duo was part of the dance competition where they won the Matabeleland South competition in 2017. <img class="wp-image-616036 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Delta Beverages Now, they have formed their own group, Bolamba Performing Arts and are working flat out to bring their best to the dance floor so they make their followers proud. “At the national final, we’re going to be up against groups from other provinces and we hope that we’ll match the standard. We’re going to maintain our unique type of dance which has proven to be very popular,” Mate said. He said doors have opened since their recent win with Delta Beverages, the Chibuku Neshamwari sponsor, supporting their art immensely by inviting them to perform at an event that was held in Bulawayo over the weekend. “We’re grateful to Delta Beverages for their support. Some of our members had never been to Bulawayo and they were excited to perform with seasoned groups like Iyasa. We’d like to thank the company for considering us, a group from down deep in the rural areas of Gwanda South to perform at such events as it gave us exposure.”  Bolamba Performing Arts has 12 members, Mate, Ngulube, Givemore Fiti Nyathi, Kegaisamang Nyathi, Ashley Phiri, Silomuzi Nyathi, Joyce Tlou, Tsepi Ndlovu, Thandolwenkosi Moyo, Njabulo Dube, Ntombi Ngulube and Dillen Moyo. Quizzed why they left the initial Bolamba group, Mate said it was due to the need to try out new things. He said they still work with former colleagues in ensuring that their performances are on point. “It’s natural that when we grow, we look for our own shelter. Management, vision and objectives may change, but we’re still together in the sense that we share a lot of developmental ideas. Before the split, we were 15 and only one dancer was from the old group. The other person is from the administration,” said Mate. He said people should look out for their upcoming Sotho album. – @mthabisi_mthire
