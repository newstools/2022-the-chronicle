THE late liberation struggle stalwart and Vice President, Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo’s legacy will continue to shine in all generations with the youth, commonly known as ‘ama2k’ and the 90s babies saying they still reminisce the inspirational stories they heard about Father Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-445571 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/The-Late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/The-Late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/The-Late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo The national hero died in 1999 before ama2k (children born in the 2000s) even came into existence. Last Friday marked the 23rd anniversary of his death. Dr Nkomo succumbed to cancer on July 1, 1999 at the age of 82 and was buried at the National Heroes Acre in Harare. The youth of today did not experience first-hand his inspirational leadership but they know, through nostalgic recollections by their elders, how he was a man of infinite love, peace and selfless sacrifice.  In separate interviews in Bulawayo, the youth said they know that the late Father Zimbabwe had the greatest vision for this country and wished he was still alive. Mr Delroy Mathobi (25) said the reason why no other national hero was given the “Father Zimbabwe” title is because none were or are like Dr Joshua Nkomo. “Even if we didn’t see him, we know that he attained the name through his father figure qualities. A father who takes good care of his children is not easily forgotten and those children shall continue praising him so that his good name never fades,” he said. “This is exactly how we as the youth know Joshua Nkomo. We have heard a lot of stories about him, which have led us to research more about the man he was. “According to our findings, he’s an inimitable hero who gave up so much for all of us to enjoy peace.” <img class="wp-image-624652 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-53.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-53.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-53-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo Mr Mathobi said in his understanding Dr Nkomo was a thorn in the flesh to those who were against the liberation of Zimbabwe. “We still live according to some of his famous sayings. The phrase ‘Nxa ufuna I ‘mali’ phendulela ibala lelo kube ngu ‘lima’ uzayithola imali’. This shows that he was someone who would encourage people to work very hard using natural resources to get the desires of their lives,” he said.  “He wished prosperity for everyone. When it comes to this encouragement of venturing into agriculture to make money, the youth are doing exactly that.” Miss Tawananyasha Simba (22) said many youngsters from Bulawayo and beyond know more about Dr Nkomo’s legacy from their parents. “We don’t know much about Nkomo in reality because we were born after his death. But what we know is what we hear from elders and from studies at school,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-624655 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-54.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-54.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-54-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “What I know is that Nkomo’s legacy continues to live.” Miss Simba said there is no way a Bulawayo youth, for instance, could not know about Dr Nkomo considering the fact the Government erected his statue at the City Centre, which continues to attract thousands of people. “That statue shall always trigger curiosity among youngsters. Once a child sees that statue, they will ask who it depicts and they will be told about him,” she said. “We also know him for having signed the Unity Accord, which gave us a holiday to kickstart our Christmas celebrations.” Miss Ethel Magodi (20) said she does not know much about the late Vice President but is aware of effort to preserve his legacy through the statue, the naming of a street after him and the airport. “I wish he was still alive so that we could witness what people are saying about him,” she said. “Nkomo is Father Zimbabwe to earlier generations but to the youth, he is ‘Grandfather’ Zimbabwe.” A 17-year-old boy from Milton High School said he is proud that Dr Nkomo’s house is in his neighborhood in Pelandaba suburb. “When we were in school during a heritage studies or history related lesson and we did a Joshua Nkomo topic I would start boasting that he was my neighbour,” he said. “I would feel like royalty just by being the neighbour of a celebrated hero,” he said.
