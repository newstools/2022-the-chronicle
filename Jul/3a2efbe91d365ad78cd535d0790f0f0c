BULAWAYO mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni has called for an urgent rehabilitation of boreholes around the city so that residents can have water even during times of water shedding. Last month, council introduced a citywide 24-hour water shedding programme as part of measures to conserve the city’s water. The Central Business District, industry and mines are, however, exempt from water shedding. Residents resort to borehole water during periods of water shedding but boreholes in some suburbs are not functioning. According to the latest council report, Clr Mguni said before enforcing water shedding, council workers should attend to all boreholes that are not working. <img class="size-full wp-image-604039" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-51-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-51-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-51-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni “Spares for vandalised boreholes should be bought and the Engineering Services Department should ensure all the boreholes that are not working have been repaired. For security and management of boreholes, water committees that involved councillors should be revived,” said Clr Mguni. Ward 18 Councillor Concilia Mlalazi said solar-powered boreholes in some parts of the city are no longer functional. “Solar-powered boreholes at Mhali and Housing Office have been out of order for a long time,” she said. Ward Two Councillor Joyce Ndlovu said her ward has no borehole. She said Neqi and Highmount are the areas with critical water shortage. <img class="size-full wp-image-467809" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Councillor-Mzama-Dube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Councillor-Mzama-Dube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Councillor-Mzama-Dube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Councillor Mzama Dube Ward Two covers Sauerstown, Tegela, Norwood, Richmond, Windsor Park and Glenville, Trenance North, Highmount, 100 Acre Lot, Harrisvale, Queensdale, Kingsdale, Northgate, Queens Park West, North End, Newmans-Ford, Lobenvale, Northlynne, Jungle, Kennilworth, Rowena, Sub 15 and 16 Trenance, Umguza Agric and Lots. Ward 25 Councillor Mzama Dube said most boreholes were handed over by donors and residents are now supposed to ensure their security. He said residents in his ward built guard rooms at boreholes and solar-powered boreholes are disconnected at night hence are still functional.  Alderman Ernest Rafomoyo said a detailed report on the status of boreholes in all wards will be submitted to this committee and the non-functional boreholes will be attended to. Residents have been urged to boil borehole water meant for drinking since the water is not treated.
