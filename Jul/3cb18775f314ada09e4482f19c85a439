As long as employees are happy, knowing that they are covered through insurance, the workplace will be productive,” said EcoSure.  To register for this service, employers should dial *900# on their mobile phones, enter their EcoCash PIN, select Micro-Employer, insert their employee’s phone number and enter at least 3 letters from the employee’s surname and confirm. Since it was introduced in Zimbabwe nearly a decade ago, EcoSure has given millions of people a reliable plan for the unexpected by reducing the financial burden presented by a funeral. <img class="alignnone wp-image-624919 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-69-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> EcoSure has a number of funeral policy packages that start from as little as US$0.50 per month up to US$5.00. Some of the packages include EcoSure Lite, EcoSure Basic, EcoSure Standard and EcoSure Premium. The funeral schemes are both payable in local currency and in US dollars. EcoSure said funeral cover is a worthwhile investment as it supports families through times of distress. “The death of a loved one is an especially stressful time, and it can be made worse by the financial strain of having to pay for funeral expenses. But if you offer your employees the chance to take out a policy with EcoSure funeral cover, then their families will be able to grieve properly while giving their loved one a dignified sendoff,” said EcoSure.
