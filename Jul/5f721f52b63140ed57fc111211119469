The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter THE Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) has expressed readiness to enter into partnership with individual farm owners with irrigable land but lacking resources. The partnership will facilitate the unlocking of full value of the land through increased productivity that will also contribute to the national economy. <img class="wp-image-625594 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-119.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-119.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-119-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vision 2030 In a statement, Arda said it was undergoing transformation to spearhead rural development and industrialisation to ensure national food security as it works towards attainment of Vision 2030. “Arda is inviting Al, A2 and commercial farm owners with irrigable land, who find themselves with limited resources to extract full value from their land, to express interest to join the market-led Arda joint venture programme for summer crop production and enhanced productivity commencing this 2022/23 summer season,” reads the statement.  Vision 2030 seeks to create a prosperous and empowered upper middle-income society with an average per capita income of US$3 207 by 2030. <img class="wp-image-611634 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-25.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-25.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-25-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The vision also encompasses national food security as enshrined in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) that nations should fight poverty and hunger. To have enough food for everyone, the Government has come up with a strategy to increase land under irrigation as climate change has seen the country experiencing many drought years. Arda said the hectarage targeted under Phase One of the proposed joint venture is at least 50 000 hectares for summer cropping. This encompasses two principal components, that is, farm owners providing access to land and labour and Arda providing other components, which farmers cannot afford. “Arda will be providing access to the following components; qualified and competent staff for management of the joint venture farms, management and agronomic support to the joint venture farms,” said the authority. Further, Arda has pledged to provide inputs and working capital support, plant and equipment, access to finance, insurance cover, technical skills transfer and market linkages and favourable farmer returns. — @SikhulekelaniM1
