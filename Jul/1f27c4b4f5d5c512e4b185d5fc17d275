Creative Challenge Show is presented by Page Poetry Alive and supported by the British Council Cultural Economy programme. This programme supports cultural organisations, festivals, artists, and creatives between the countries of Southern African Arts (SAA) and the United Kingdom (UK) to create art, build networks, collaborate, develop markets and share artists’ work with audiences. Organisers of the television game show said the intellectual game will emphasise the need to be aware of climate issues. “The aim of this project is to impact digital spaces using storytelling in exploitative ways and create art that changes the way youth around the world view climate issues, ” said the organisers. The show will blend works of literature, digital skills, film, and diverse collaborative arts. It will consist of three competitive segments happening both virtually and in person. There will be three teams having three members each battling it out. There will also be orientation and training preparations for participants via WhatsApp commencing this week. – @eMKlass_49
