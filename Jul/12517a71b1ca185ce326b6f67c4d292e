THE United States of America is eyeing top spot in their group in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Qualifier B when they face Zimbabwe in the last group match at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo today. Zimbabwe and USA have qualified for the semi-finals of the eight-team competition and today’s game will decide which team will top the group. USA tops the Group A with a superior net run rate following huge wins in their last two matches and want to retain pole position by upsetting Zimbabwe this afternoon. <img class="wp-image-626209 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Queens Sports Club USA has a net run rate of +3.857 from their two wins, while Zimbabwe’s net run rate is +3.350. Topping the group means meeting the second-placed team in Group B in the semi-finals. Netherlands occupies top spot in Group B, with Uganda and Papua New Guinea each set to battle for second place. They have both won one and lost once. USA all-rounder Cameron Stevenson said they want to win against Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-612771 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Captain Craig Ervine “We’ve got bigger things on our plate in the next days, the semi-final and a match against Zimbabwe. Hopefully, we can top the group against them on Thursday. We are focused on the end goal,” said Stevenson. He said their goal was to reach the finals and take USA to a maiden T20 World Cup. “It’s an enormous goal for me individually and I know that everyone in the team is focused on putting performances together to get us there. “To take America to a World Cup will be an incredible experience and I know that the boys are driving hard at it,” he said. <img class="wp-image-627490 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Saurabh Netravalkar In their first match on Monday at BAC, USA beat Jersey by eight wickets after top-order batsman Steven Taylor made 101 runs in their chase of 154/5. In the second match against Singapore, USA posted 201/6 with Taylor and Jaskaran Malhotra top-scoring with 58 runs each. Left-arm fast bowler Saurabh Netravalkar shredded the Singaporean batting attack, taking five wickets for 12 runs in his four overs. This was the first five-wicket haul by USA in a T20 international. Zimbabwe got off to a blistering start in the tournament by beating Singapore by 111 runs after setting a record target of 236 runs at Queens Sports Club on Monday. All-rounder Sikandar Raza top-scored with 87 runs, while the experienced Sean Williams scored 57, as they put the Singapore bowling attack to the sword. <img class="wp-image-610363 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-89.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-89.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-89-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Regis Chakabva Opening batsmen, captain Craig Ervine (34) and Regis Chakabva (24) set the tone as Zimbabwe raced to 65/2 in the first five overs. A 103-run partnership between Williams and Raza set up the huge total. In the next match, Zimbabwe managed 146 runs with Williams top-scoring with 57 runs and a late cameo of 29 not out by Luke Jongwe enabled the hosts to successfully defend the seemingly low score.  Disciplined bowling by Zimbabwe, especially leg-spinner Ryan Burl, who took 3/13 in his four overs, helped choke Jersey to 123 runs in 20 overs, despite spirited batting by Harrison Carlyon, who scored a stubborn 45 runs. —   @bonganinkunzi
