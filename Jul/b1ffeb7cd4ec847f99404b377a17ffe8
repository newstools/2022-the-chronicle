The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City FC assistant coach Bekithemba Ndlovu has challenged his charges to put in the work or risk getting relegated. A clearly unimpressed Ndlovu barked at his charges at a training session yesterday at White City Stadium as they failed to put in the expected intensity. “If you play like this at training, you boys will get relegated. The way you train is the same way you will play in a game. Give us the exact same energy that you will give us in a game,” he shouted.  Bulawayo City will face Herentals FC at Barbourfields Stadium on Saturday seeking nothing but three points in their battle to avoid relegation. The municipal side is third from bottom on the Premier Soccer League table having collected 21 points from 22 encounters. They are just a point away from escaping the relegation zone with Harare City and ZPC Kariba only a point ahead of City in position 14 and 15 respectively. Ndlovu and his head coach Farai Tawachera are well aware that only hard work will take them out of the murky relegation waters. <img class="wp-image-567074 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/fsgjdj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/fsgjdj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/fsgjdj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Farai Tawachera “We need to fight to survive relegation. What is needed is for us to keep pushing and that comes with hard work,” said Tawachera. Commenting on their next match he said: “It’s one of those games where we have to try and get a win. Given that we lost our last match it’s important for us to pick ourselves up and get back to winning ways. <img class="wp-image-583002 size-article-featured-image" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Obadiah-Tarumbwa-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Obadiah-Tarumbwa-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Obadiah-Tarumbwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obadiah Tarumbwa “If we put in the same shift like we did against Highlanders we can get something out of this game.” Veteran midfielder Welcome Ndiweni, strikers Dalubuhle Dlodlo, Roddy Sibanda and defender Mpumelelo Bhebhe are all doubts for Saturday’s game as they all suffered knocks in the last game against Highlanders. “We have injuries, yes, but I believe we have enough replacements. We have guys who received knocks at the weekend and we are assessing how they will be going into the weekend. We hope they will be back,” said Tawachera. <img class="wp-image-577236 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Highlanders-and-Ngezi-Platinum-Stars-players-warming-up-before-the-match-was-cancelled-yesterday-at-Barbourfields-Stadium.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Highlanders-and-Ngezi-Platinum-Stars-players-warming-up-before-the-match-was-cancelled-yesterday-at-Barbourfields-Stadium.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Highlanders-and-Ngezi-Platinum-Stars-players-warming-up-before-the-match-was-cancelled-yesterday-at-Barbourfields-Stadium-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Barbourfields Stadium Veteran striker Obadiah Tarumbwa has been training with City and is likely to be part of the team this weekend. “We hope to utilise him. He just has to continue working like he is doing. He will play.” — @innocentskizoe
