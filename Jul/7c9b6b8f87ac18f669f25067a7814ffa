GOVERNMENT yesterday installed Mr Ngqabutho Nkululeko Mathe as Chief Mathe in a ceremony held at Silobi Primary School in Umzingwane, Matabeleland South. Mr Mathe (51) takes over from his father, the late Leonard Mathe, who died in 2016.  The ceremony was held at the primary school as opposed to the norm where chiefs are installed at their rural homes as some of the family members did not support his installation. It is alleged that late Chief Mathe sired Ngqabutho with his oldest wife before they separated with the woman moving away with the heir. <img class="size-full wp-image-628135" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/chief-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/chief-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/chief-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Mathe installation The late chief’s second wife is said to have been against Ngqabutho’s appointment. The new chief was also not a resident of Silobi area and for most people it was the first time to interact with their traditional leader. However, Nguni customs demand that the eldest son be the heir to a vacant chieftaincy. The family feud did not stop the community from celebrating the appointment of the new chief. Pupils from Silobi Primary School and nearby schools entertained guests through traditional dances who had gathered to witness the chief’s installation. <img class="wp-image-628150 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Phathisa-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Phathisa-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Phathisa-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Pathisa Nyathi The proceedings started at about 12 noon with historian Mr Pathisa Nyathi, giving a historical background on how the chieftaincy started. Mr Nyathi said the Mathe chieftaincy can be described as one of the critical ones to the formation of Ndebele State under King Mzilikazi.  It is said the first chief to be appointed by King Mzilikazi was Gwabalanda Mathe. “This is the first chieftaincy to be created under Mthwakazi. So, after Mzilikazi had confiscated the loot after raiding Sotho people, King Tshaka sent Mhlangandlovu to go and confiscate the cattle that Mzilikazi had raided from the Sotho. Mzilikazi refused to hand over the cattle to him and cut off his headgear. The headgear was critical as it covered the nakedness of a warrior. So, fearing Tshaka, he Mhlangandlovu (Gwabalanda Mathe) never returned to Tshaka and remained under Mzilikazi. He was a traditional healer and a spiritual leader for King Mzilikazi as he escaped from KwaZulu-Natal. That is why he was called Mhlahlandlela, meaning he spiritually paved the way for King Mzilikazi and they trekked northwards,” said Mr Nyathi.  He said Gwabalanda Mathe led the first group of men which left Zululand which was named Amhlophe because it consisted mainly of the elderly people. Mr Nyathi said in the succession, the Mathe chieftaincy was shifted to the Ndiweni family who were holding the position on a temporary basis before the chieftaincy returned to its rightful house. He said the appointment of a chief is important to the holding of a people’s culture and customs.  Speaking during the ceremony, Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo concurred with Mr Nyathi saying Gwabalanda Mathe, who became the first chief was also related to King Mzilikazi. He said Government remains committed to upholding traditional cultural norms including the appointment of chiefs. Minister Moyo said traditional leaders are crucial in the process of rural development and are a conduit of attainment of Vision 2030.  “Traditional leaders play an important role working with councillors in identifying and prioritising, implementing and monitoring development projects in their areas to be funded by devolution funds and other sources of funding within their areas,” said Minister Moyo. He said traditional leaders should work closely with Government agencies to spearhead development projects. The Minister said traditional leaders must not stand aloof when they see civil servants failing to perform their duties. Minister Moyo said areas without traditional leaders are likely to lag behind as they will not have a voice from grassroots that is taking up their issues. “Now that you have a chief, your chief can take up your issues to the President because chiefs have access to the President. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-628129" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/chief.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/chief.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/chief-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 had disrupted the annual meetings that the President had with chiefs but this year, I believe he will be able to meet with the traditional leaders,” said Minister Moyo. Newly-installed Chief Mathe said he was ready to initiate development projects to benefit locals. “There are many things that need to be done in this area and putting my trust in God, I wish to fulfil the developmental wishes for my people. All this we need to do with respect and understanding.  “We don’t have a proper road network, this area does not have a mobile network so there is a need to fix the roads while also installing network boosters. We hope these things are expedited because our people have suffered for a very long time,” said Chief Mathe. Village heads and headman swore their allegiance towards the Chief Mathe in an event which was attended by various Government departments. – @nqotshili.
