The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter WITH a third of the 2021/22 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches left, the championship battle is turning into a three-team race, with champions FC Platinum in firm control of the race after opening a six-point lead. Leaders FC Platinum, who beat ZPC Kariba 1-0 through a Donald Teguru goal, are in title contention with Chicken Inn and Dynamos. Eight points separate leaders FC Platinum, who have amassed 47 points in 22 games and third on the table Dynamos, who put up a brilliant show to hand second placed Chicken Inn a heavy 3-0 defeat in Bulawayo. <img class="wp-image-630535 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Ndiraya..jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Ndiraya..jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Ndiraya.-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tonderai Ndiraya Defender Frank Makarati, midfielder Junior Makunike and striker Emmanuel Paga got the goals that secured victory for Dynamos and eased pressure on coach Tonderai Ndiraya who had lost favour from some sections within DeMbare. It was a sweet victory for Dynamos in the sense that besides ending a six-year winless jinx against Chicken Inn in Bulawayo, they also bounced back to winning ways having gone for four league matches without collecting maximum points. The last time DeMbare registered a win in Bulawayo against Chicken Inn was in 2015 when they edged the Gamecocks 1-0. In 2016 Dynamos were beaten 3-0 in Bulawayo, they drew 0-0 in 2017, lost 1-0 in 2018 and 2-0 in 2019. There were no league matches played in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19. But now Dynamos, after a four-match winless streak that included two identical 0-0 draws against FC Platinum and Triangle United, as well as losing by similar 1-0 score lines to Cranborne Bullets and Yadah, have sent a statement of intent by clobbering Chicken Inn. <img class="wp-image-604741 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-11-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-11-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-11-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Emmanuel Paga What Dynamos now need is consistency, hoping that along the way FC Platinum stumble and they close in. Chicken Inn are being let down by inconsistency and having lost to championship contenders FC Platinum and Dynamos by an identical 3-0 score-line in the second half of the season, they could slip further if they fail to improve. The defeat to Dynamos left Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas fuming. <img class="wp-image-621889 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas “We didn’t pitch up, we didn’t compete. Once again, we made defensive errors and got punished. There wasn’t much creativity at all from us. Most of the guys didn’t pitch up, it was a poor performance all round. It was a  terrible day and we deserved the beating,” said Antipas. While Chicken Inn mourn about failure to turn-up for the gruelling encounter against Dynamos, FC Platinum’s goalkeeper Wallace Magalane celebrated his ninth consecutive clean sheet to inspire his side to victory. FC Platinum, with three successive titles, are marching towards joining giants Highlanders and Dynamos in the list of clubs who have won four league titles on the trot.
