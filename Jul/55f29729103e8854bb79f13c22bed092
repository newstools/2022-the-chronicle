The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls 
MONALISA “Queen of the jungle” Sibanda lived up to her boxing moniker as she defended her WIBA intercontinental title against Uganda’s Small Valente Aciro here on Wednesday. Zimbabwe’s Sibanda said she fasted ‘for three years’ asking God for the stamina to defend her title and during that time she dated no man. She said she promised her children that she would bring back the title home and that is what happened, the belt remains in Zimbabwe. Sibanda has been with the WIBA title since 2019 when she beat Kenyan Joyce Awino before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic led to suspension of events. <img class="size-full wp-image-632647" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Joyce-Awino.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Joyce-Awino.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Joyce-Awino-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joyce Awino It was a perfect sporting night before a full house at Kingdom Hotel Casino room where the ring was set and the Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Kirsty Coventry and senior officials from the ministry were part of the spectators. The crowd comprised delegates to the World Boxing Council (WBC) All-Africa Officials Training and Grading Workshop and Africa Boxing Union (ABU) seminar and boxing fans from Victoria Falls. Sibanda won via a unanimous decision after a full ten rounds after dominating almost all rounds, keeping her opponent retreating and even knocked her down twice. Even a knock on the head that left her bleeding above the right eye, causing a brief stoppage in the eighth round after being head butted by Aciro, could not dampen Sibanda’s fighting spirit. “You can’t be a champion without fighting. As a boxer I had to train. I promised my children Shallom and Trinity that I was going to bring back the title. I was fit, I prepared for this for three years and I even cancelled my love life. For three years I was not in a relationship as I was training hard and fasting for this fight because I knew it is important,” said an ecstatic Sibanda, adding that no one could do what she did in the past three years.  She could not stop thanking sponsors, corporate world, Government, her coach, the National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board and Zimbabweans for the support. “I thank the Almighty God for this opportunity. It was not easy for me to defend my title and even the fight wasn’t easy for me, it was close to being tough but I thank God I have my title. I was ready to face any injury or anything to defend my title. So, I am proud of myself,” she said. Before the bout, her coach Simon Sankulani even said the boxer’s eyes had turned into those of a lioness as she was raging for war. Aciro blamed her defeat on an injured knee. “I was slow because my leg is failing me. I was jogging in the morning when I fell and injured my knee and since then it has not been fit. They didn’t give me enough time to heal and prepare for this after my injury. “I still want the belt. I am going to ask for a rematch and I know they will give us because the belt has to go to Uganda at all costs,” said Aciro in an interview. <img class="size-full wp-image-632650" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-25-at-12.05.31-PM.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-25-at-12.05.31-PM.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-25-at-12.05.31-PM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stalin Mau Mau Renowned promoter Stalin Mau Mau and the ZNBWCB organised the fight. While Sibanda was an obvious attraction, there seem to be new emerging gems in Victoria Falls – seven-year-old Wandisa Sibanda and Mbalenhle Ncube (8) battled it out in an amateur bout that ended in a draw. Both are in Grade Two at Chinotimba Primary and are attached to the Victoria Falls Boxing Academy. Anele Bafana of Hwange beat Alick Gogodo of Zambia hands down to win through a TKO in the second round of a six-round cruiserweight fight. Lloyd Mujibilkwa of the Vic Falls Academy settled for a draw after four rounds with Tinofadzwa Chikerema in the super lightweight match. Jeremiah beat Bernard Mwango of Malawi via a unanimous decision. — @ncubeleon
