THE Lupane Women’s Development Trust (LWDT)’s operations continue to impact positively on the livelihoods of its nearly 4 000 members. The organisation, which started in 2010, has a membership of 3 708 women whose operations are transforming hundreds of families across Matabeleland North Province. <img class="wp-image-615718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-55-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> livestock The organisation is not just producing for local consumption but for exports as well. In an interview LWDT director, Mrs Hildigard Mufukare, said the trust provides training on horticulture, livestock farming, bee keeping and basketry.  “We invite a few of them to the centre, especially those who show potential and then get someone to train them. The women will in turn train others in their respective villages,” she said. She said most of the women that have been equipped with various skills now enjoy improved lifestyles as evidenced by many of them buying furniture, cattle and other such properties. <img class="wp-image-452987 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/horticulture-500x500.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/horticulture-500x500.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/horticulture-500x500-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> horticulture “The business is doing well for most of the women who now have regular income from their works,” said Mrs Mufukare. The organisation’s operations are in line with the Government’s desire to transform Zimbabwe into an upper middle-income status by 2030. Mrs Mufukare, however, said the organisation is facing a shortage of working space and appealed to Government to assist. – @BlehKarubwa.
