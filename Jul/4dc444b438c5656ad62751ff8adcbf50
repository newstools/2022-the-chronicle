I basically can’t charge what I want,” said Mr Mkwananzi.  He said the store offers a range of products and their staff is readily available to help. “We offer all sorts of power tools and their accessories, hand tools, pumps, garden tools, safety products, generators, air tools, measuring tools and accessories for the hardware industry. We have four people and this is the only concept store in the city,” said Mr Mkwananzi. He said INGCO products have proven to be durable and hoped the customers will flock to the shop and buy. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623536" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/ingco-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/ingco-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/ingco-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> INGCO tools are devoted to making professional quality tools affordable.
