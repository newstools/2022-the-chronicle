The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls 
NEWLY appointed Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) chief executive, Ms Winnie Muchanyuka, has rallied players in the tourism industry to come together and join forces in marketing the destination for revival of tourism. She was speaking after a “meet and greet” session with industry players in Victoria Falls recently. The meeting was attended by various industry players including hoteliers, tour operators, enabling sectors, small and medium enterprises and others. <img class="wp-image-614584 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-62-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 Ms Muchanyuka said there is need to establish a sectoral committee dubbed Team Tourism Zimbabwe for a joint marketing of the destination in the wake of effects of Covid-19. The sector was hardest hit by the global pandemic, which led to closure of industry following international travel restrictions. Some businesses laid off workers while others failed to re-open as a result. Ms Muchanyuka is not new to the tourism industry as she is a former president of the Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe, and became ZTA chief executive officer last month, taking over from Mr Karikoga Kaseke who retired due to ill health. ZTA chief operating officer Mr Givemore Chidzidzi had been acting CEO. Ms Muchanyuka said tourism was an important pillar for the success of the country’s economy.  “The meet and greet that we had with industry here in Victoria Falls was critical so that I could get all the players in one room and do a formal introduction. “The reason for the meeting was to ask for industry support in the initiatives that the authority has especially in the area of marketing of the destination,” said Ms Muchanyuka. “Coming out of Covid-19, it has become critical that we start marketing again and critical to our marketing is to create marketing committee between industry and authority. “We want to ensure that we move together as Team Zimbabwe Tourism and not as the authority to market the country for the destination to become more popular and to gain in its rankings,” she said. <img class="wp-image-615964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-38-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-38-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-38-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu Ms Muchanyuka said the Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, recently met industry players in Harare where he insisted that there should be a committee. She said such a committee, once in place, would meet once a month to ensure the industry gains traction on issues of common interest and enable players to have ease of doing business while implementing the National Development Strategy 1. <img class="wp-image-624949 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-72.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-72.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-72-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) ZTA is planning on conducting roadshows and exhibitions as it drives the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) strategy. This dovetails with the Tourism Growth and Recovery Strategy through which the country targets a US$5 billion tourism industry by 2025. Ms Muchanyuka said her meeting with industry players in Victoria Falls highlighted some challenges faced by tourism among them difficulties faced by visitors at ports of entry like Kazungula. She said there is need to engage Government and line ministries as well as border authorities such as Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Immigration Department and others to resolve the issues and make the country’s borders more seamless and promote regional tourism. Kazungula Border on the border with Botswana, Namibia and Zambia is key to tourism as it handles long-haul tourists who visit multi-destinations. — @ncubeleon
