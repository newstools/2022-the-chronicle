The Chronicle Senior Business Reporter THE revival of Bulawayo’s industrial base will come under the spotlight in August when the Matabeleland Development Initiative (MDI) holds a dialogue to map out strategies to resuscitate it. Ms Nokuthula Ncube,  Programmes Director of MDI said in line with National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), the Government’s economic policy through to 2025 which is targeting rebuilding Zimbabwe’s once vibrant industrial base, said several players drawn from various sectors will deliberate on reviving industries.  The dialogue that would coincide with the launch of Queen Loziba Education Fund would be held under the theme “Enhancing sustainable development by facilitating the creation of an enabling environment for investment” Bulawayo suffered decade-long economic challenges that caused many firms to fold, with the majority of those that survived relocating to Harare. <img class="alignnone wp-image-631936 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Thousands of jobs were lost and it is in that vein that MDI seeks to input in the resuscitation drive. “We are bringing together business entities from Matabeleland to dialogue on the resuscitation of industries in the region and explore the growth paths of other business sectors. “We held the first dialogue edition in 2018 and due to Covid-19 pandemic, we could not hold subsequent editions,” she said. MDI is dedicated to achieving sustainable development, economic growth by investing in education, health as well as the environment and economic development in the Matabeleland region. “The city and the region have several firms which used to employ a lot of people that are now closed but we believe those industries can be resuscitated through dialogue and mapping out strategies. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 “We are hoping to attract Government officials, local authorities and industrialists to give insights on public private partnerships (PPPs). As the country is seized with National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) we are hopeful that a lasting solution can be found for regional industries and businesses in general,” she said. Despite the disruptive Covid-19 pandemic in the past two years, the city registered strong business recovery momentum in 2021, which was evidenced by improved capacity utilisation and exports by several local companies. <img class="wp-image-614770 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Datlabs Riding on the ongoing ease of doing business reforms, fiscal incentives and enhanced access to foreign currency through the auction system, the Government has pledged that, going forward, more attention will be given to assisting ailing firms and resuscitating some of the closed operations.
