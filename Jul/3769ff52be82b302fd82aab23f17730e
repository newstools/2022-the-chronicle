The power utility has admitted to having challenges in providing adequate power on the back of antiquated equipment and other operational hurdles. With the latest nod, Zesa has guaranteed uninterrupted power for sections of the industry that can pay in hard currency, which enables it to mobilise resources to import from the region to reduce the deficit from local generation. <img class="wp-image-616678 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-12-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-12-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-12-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Under a recent Statutory Instrument 131 of 2022, exporting firms are now required to pay part of their electricity bills in foreign currency. Based on the SI, the regulations are valid for the next six months unless earlier renewed for another period not exceeding six months. “Subject to subsection (2) and designated consumer of electricity may enter into a contract or memorandum of agreement with Zesa to pay in advance for the supply of electricity to Zesa in foreign currency,” reads part of the SI. A copy of the contract or memorandum of agreement would be required to be submitted to the regulatory, the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe before implementation.  According to the Statutory Instrument, revenue generated would be channelled towards procurement of critical equipment and machinery. Zesa is required to open a foreign currency account to facilitate deposits. However, the power utility shall not make any withdrawals or payments from any foreign currency account opened without approval from the Ministers of Finance and Economic Development and Energy and Power Development . The funds are to be used for repayment of external loans, purchasing electricity outside the country, importation of spare parts, transmission, distribution and retail infrastructure of the electricity network to ensure sustainable supply. <img class="wp-image-605950 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority In June, the country’s platinum miners entered into a special arrangement with Zesa where the mines prepay the power utility’s offshore creditors in exchange for guaranteed and uninterrupted electricity supply to boost the mineral’s output. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company has said due to depressed local power generation coupled with increased electricity demand in winter and power import constraints, there would be increased load shedding.
