So committed to the cause is the provincial leadership that Politburo members such as Cdes Samuel Mumbengegwi, Tsitsi Muzenda and Joram Gumbo and Central Committee members such as Engineer Daniel Mackenzie Ncube were also deployed to cells and branches of Chirumhanzu for the outreach programme. The outreach programme is also aimed to make sure that the province contributes to the five million votes the ruling party needs to walk over the opposition come 2023 elections. Zanu-PF Midlands provincial chairperson Minister Larry Mavima said the party is moving around the province verifying its structures and mobilising people to register to vote. “We are meeting here in Mvuma before we go out to meet the people. To see the members in the cells and districts. This is an important exercise aimed at mobilising members to register to vote, as well as strengthening cell and branch structures ahead of the 2023 harmonised elections. We will be going to all the eight administrative districts making up the province,” said Minister Mavima. He said it is also an important exercise as the members are made aware of the developmental projects that are being undertaken by the Second Republic. “We are also conscientising the people about the expectations and operations of the New Dispensation. We want to ensure a resounding victory for our candidates especially that of President Mnangagwa in the 2023 elections,” said Minister Mavima. <img class="wp-image-611793 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-85-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-85-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-85-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Larry Mavima He said there is need for people without national identity cards to make use of the national exercise so that they have the proper documentation to register as voters. “One can’t claim to be a member of Zanu-PF yet he or she is not registered. It’s as good as you are not our member. People must get IDs so that they register to vote. A slogan without registering to vote is nothing,” said Minister Mavima. He said the party should also prepare for the Gokwe-Kabuyuni constituency by-election set for August 27. President Mnangagwa proclaimed a by-election in Gokwe Kabuyuni to fill a post which became vacant following the death of Cde Lovemore Chikomba who died in a road traffic accident in May. “We need to retain this seat, we need to honour Cde Chikomba by retaining the seat and preparations are needed as a matter of urgency. July 26 we will be having party primary election,” he said. Addressing party members at Siyahukwe Village, Eng Mackenzie Ncube said the Zanu-PF-led Government is hands on and people centred. “President Mnangagwa is our sole candidate for 2023 elections. He has done a lot for the development of the country and will continue doing so because of his love for the people and the country. “So I urge you to go and get your national identity cards those who don’t have them. Remember President Mnangagwa made it possible that you get them for free after that you register to vote,” he said. Eng Mackenzie Ncube said Chirumhanzu people in need of food aid will receive it as soon as possible. “This year people didn’t get much from the fields.  President Mnangagwa has said no one must die from hunger so no one will be left to die. Get your names registered with your local leadership and soon you will receive the food aid,” he said. Eng Mackenzie Ncube said the country is also reeling under the sanctions imposed by Britain and her allies. “The opposition is the one calling for these sanctions and we must not be associated with opposition. We must not allow opposition to rule. Our gallant sons and daughters fought for this country. Some died and some were injured for the freedom we enjoy today and it will be a shame if we give the opposition any seats. That must not happen,” he said. Next week the ruling party will be in Gokwe North district for the outreach programme.
