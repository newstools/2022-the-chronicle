The Chronicle Wedding of . . . Raphael Tatenda Mativenga, the fifth born child of Raphael Josias Mativenga and Sarah Moyo of Gokwe and Sehlule Thambo Ndiweni, the third born child of Simiso Thambo and Bekezela Mabhena of Ntabazinduna. Tied the knot on . . . June 26, 2022. We chose . . . Euphorie Events in Bulawayo because it is a classy and upmarket venue. With the weather in mind, seeing that we are in winter, we opted for a place that would have a warm atmosphere to keep our guests warm together with the awesome services they provide. How did you meet your husband? We met in April 2021 through a mutual friend. He then invited me to his church the next Sabbath (Saturday) and we went together. We spent the day worshipping together and he took me home in the evening. Thereafter, he invited me for a hike the next day to a nice place. The feelings developed from there. He then proposed in August last year. I gave it a hard thought and agreed to marry him. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628435 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-102.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-102.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-102-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Leading up to the wedding . . . It was exciting as my right-hand persons – my matron of honour Miss Similo Thambo Ndiweni, my sister-in-law – tete Shumirai Mativenga, and other loved ones were there for us and ensured everything went smoothly. My fiancé was equally supportive as a well-organised man and a great planner too. He was fully hands-on with everything. Did you face any challenges preparing for the wedding? The greatest challenge was planning the wedding from South Africa as we’re both based there. We only arrived in Zimbabwe five before the wedding. So, we mostly planned with the assistance of loved ones who were on the ground. This meant that making some decisions took time. But all the same, with the help of the aforementioned, all came out beautifully. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628432 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-99.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-99.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-99-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wedding colours . . . We chose Mandebele Print, dusty pink and royal blue as our wedding colours as we wanted something that would identify with our culture and still remain modernly unique and elegant. My wedding dress . . . For the joining ceremony, I wore an all-white gown that had elaborate bead detail with lace all over, complete with a lace veil. It was designed by Tsholo Fashions Collection in South Africa and adorned and decorated with Mandebele Beads forehead, palm and neck beads with a white bridal Zulu Isicholo hat for the reception. The bridal team . . . was an eight-member one with Ngonidzashe Mativenga as best man and Senele Thambo Ndiweni as best lady. The cake . . . was a five-tier fruit cake that was baked by Tanaka Cakes. My favourite part of the wedding . . . was when the MC opened up the dance floor for gifts and dances to our guests who understood the assignment. They did dance-off challenges which were a lot of fun.
he most touching moment . . . was when we exchanged our vows and had our first dance together as a married couple. Guest list . . . 200. Photography was provided by . . . Brooklyn Films Festival.
