HIGHLANDERS midfield kingpin Nqobizitha Masuku is scheduled to fly out for a trial stint at Al Rams FC in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today and will miss the derby against Bulawayo City at Barbourfields Stadium. <img class="wp-image-571018 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Barbourfields-Stadium-pitch.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Barbourfields-Stadium-pitch.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Barbourfields-Stadium-pitch-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Barbourfields Stadium Masuku, who turned 29 last month is scheduled to play in a trial match for Al Rams. Usually impeccable sources told Chronicle Sport yesterday that the central defensive midfielder who has been a key figure at Highlanders is expected to fly out of the country today. “Masuku got his visa on Tuesday and sought a clearance from the club to travel to UAE where they want to assess him in a game situation on Sunday before signing him. It’s almost a done deal for him because they do have his video portfolio. “He was supposed to leave today (yesterday), but there was a mix-up on his itinerary which means he might fly out tomorrow (today),” said a source.  However, Highlanders sent a statement on Twitter yesterday evening saying their vice-captain had left when in fact he leaves at midday today. “Wishing our vice-captain, Nqobizitha Masuku all the best on his trials at Al Rams FC of United Arab of Emirates. Masuku left the country today, and he won’t be available for the weekend derby against Bulawayo City,” wrote Bosso yesterday. Chronicle Sport has it in good authority that Highlanders coach Baltemar Brito was opposed to Masuku travelling before the City game and preferred that he leaves after the match. Masuku missed last weekend’s 2-1 away defeat at Whawha. In the absence of Masuku in Gweru, Darlington Mukuli stood in front of the central defence, with Adrian Silla playing in front of him alongside Divine Mhindirira. <img class="wp-image-607468 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-21-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-21-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-21-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Adrian Silla Silla is equally capable of filling Masuku’s gap. While the availability of Masuku is doubtful should he manage to get a flight today, City will be without two key players – utility player Leslie Dumo Lunga and midfielder Elshama Farasi due to suspension after they accumulated three yellow cards each. City, third from the bottom of the table with 21 points in 21 outings, will be on the hunt for a fourth consecutive victory as they continue with their survival battle. City stunned Highlanders 1-0 in the first leg through a Melikhaya Ncube goal. The local authority side will look to on-loan Highlanders striker Rodi Sibanda and Dalu Dlodlo to lead their attack.
Meanwhile, Bulawayo Chiefs travel to Rusape for a date with Tenax CS FC tomorrow, hopeful of ending a four-match winless streak which includes a draw and three successive defeats. Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso predicted a tough outing yesterday but wants his charges to adapt and snatch points. – @ZililoR.
