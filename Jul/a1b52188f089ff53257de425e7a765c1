FC Platinum goalkeeper Wallace Magalane equalled his 2017 record of eight clean sheets on Sunday when the defending champions held Dynamos to a 0-0 draw at the National Sports Stadium. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628993 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-10-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-10-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-10-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The 28-year-old shot-stopper is proving to be a vital cog for the platinum miners’ title defence as evidenced by his excellent goal keeping performances since being given an opportunity to guard the goals after seasoned goalie Petros Mhari suffered an injury in April. Magalane, a benchwarmer for the better part of the season as FC Platinum relied on the experience of Mhari, has grabbed with both hands the opportunity presented to him to show his class. The former Bantu Rovers and Bulawayo Chiefs goalkeeper was called into first team after FC Platinum’s last defeat on April 30 when they went down 1-0 to Herentals in Harare and has never looked back. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628996 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-11-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-11-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-11-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Magalane, who briefly left FC Platinum for Caps United in 2020 before returning to Zvishavane last year after failing to guard goals for the Green Machine due to the Covid-19 inspired suspension of the 2020 season, has kept eight clean sheets, guiding the defending champions to seven consecutive wins. The seven consecutive wins were 3-0 against Caps United, 2-0 away at Yadah, 4-0 home win against Triangle United, three aways victories to Cranborne Bullets (1-0), Tenax (2-0) and Chicken Inn (3-0). Bulawayo Chiefs were the last team to go down to FC Platinum, losing 1-0 at Mandava. On Sunday, they drew 0-0 with Dynamos. <img class="alignnone wp-image-629002 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-9-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-9-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-9-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The record of eight clean sheets equals the one that Magalane posted for FC Platinum in 2017, the season they won their first championship. That season he had wrestled the starting jersey from Mhari. Mhari will have to work hard to reclaim his jersey from Magalane. When Magalane was thrown into the fray, FC Platinum were fourth on the table with 22 points from 13 games, eight points behind Chicken Inn, who were at the top having played 14 games. FC Platinum were then awarded three points on a 3-0 score line for the abandoned Highlanders game to reduce Chicken Inn’s gap to five. Now FC Platinum top the table enjoying a three-point lead over Chicken Inn.  Following the weekend’s draw against Dynamos, FC Platinum have amassed 44 points in 21 games. Besides Magalane being key in their title chase, FC Platinum’s defence that has among other seasoned faces Gift Bello, Lawrence Mhlanga, Gift Mbweti and Nomore Chinyerere has been watertight, conceding just seven goals in 21 games. The platinum miners have complemented their defensive abilities by being ruthless at goal, having scored the most number of goals compared to any team in the present season, 32 goals. FC Platinum’s next match is at home to relegation-threatened ZPC Kariba, with Magalane, if selected to play, eager to continue with his fine run of form. — @ZililoR
