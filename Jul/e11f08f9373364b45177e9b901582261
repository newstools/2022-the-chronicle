The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter GUITARIST Tariro NeGitare performed at the Bulawayo Theatre at the weekend to carry forward her series of shows that she is currently embarking on. The “Tariro NeGitare in Concert” took a detour at the City of kings and queens on Saturday where she brought the Bulawayo Theatre down with a well-polished set.  Barely days after her first of three shows took place in Harare, Tari put on an energetic performance laced with choreography and a blend of instruments. Some of the songs she played included Chipo Changu, Usadaro, Surrender, and a cover of South African late artiste Hugh Masekela’s Thuma mina. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628822 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-22-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-22-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-22-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> At one point, she was left alone with her guitar on stage and she gave a soulful piece of Surrender. The singer showed how important it is to have a special connection with one’s audience as she gave fans a chance to join her on stage and sing a few lines of one of her songs. A challenge ensued to see who would sing the song best. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628825 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gospel music lovers must have had a weekend to remember as Tari belted out spiritually-uplifting music with precision. Gospel musician Vuyo Brown joined Tari on stage for a performance of their single, Areka and the two received a standing ovation for their efforts. After the Bulawayo show, Tari NeGitare is expected to head down to the resort city of Victoria Falls for a show on August 5. – @eMKlass_49
