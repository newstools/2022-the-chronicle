“IT’S morphing time!” A lot of children and those young at heart will remember these famous words synonymous with the American superhero television series, Power Rangers which had Jason Lee Scott as their leader. There is a new breed of Zimbabwean “Power Rangers” who are changing the visual arts industry in distant lands. Shanduko (to change/morph) is a group exhibition curated by Richard Mudariki and devoted to four contemporary Zimbabwean visual artists; Linnet Rubaya, Franklyn Dzingai, Mostaff Muchawaya and Wilfred Timire. <img class="wp-image-625834 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Linnet Rubaya One member of the group exhibition, Linnet Rubaya told Saturday Leisure how it all started for her in the visual arts divide. “I’m a self-taught British-Zimbabwean figurative artist based in Leeds. I was born in Harare 31 years ago and was raised in London. I studied Biomedical Science (BSc) at the University of Brighton with hopes of being a doctor but moved to Leeds to work as a Software Test Analyst. I know I described what I do but what I do is an extension of who I am. Beyond that, I’m still figuring out who I am,” she said. Rubaya pays homage to her father and credits his availability in moulding the feminine force of art that she has become. “As any Zimbabwean kid, my life was adorned with art from the wooden and stone sculptures that seemed to be in every household to watching cartoons. I think the difference was my mum and dad actively created things. Spending one summer at my father’s house in Bulawayo paved the way for me. “If my memory serves me right, I think I drew a cartoon or something and my father said it was good, but the proportions were off (like any 6/7-year-old would do). Instead of leaving it at that, he decided that we’d spend more time perfecting my drawing but we’d start with the basics – stickman or hangman! We drew stick men again and again until I started to get the proportions right. I essentially had a masterclass in proportions! To this day, when I’m sketching ideas out, I start with stickmen,” she said. Rubaya won the Saul Hay Emerging Artist Award last year, which she said has opened more doors for her. “It (winning the award) was amazing. I was in tears when I found out! As part of the award, I was given the opportunity to have my first solo exhibition. This was the first time I began to think about my work as collections of work being displayed together in a space. I learnt a lot about storytelling, finding the balance between bearing it all on a canvas and leaving more to be desired. This was an invaluable experience and has changed the way I approach my work since then,” she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-625843" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bridgman Studio Award (2019) Rubaya has also been shortlisted for several awards including UK Young Artist of the Year 2019 (now known as UK New Artist of the Year), Bridgman Studio Award (2019) and Art Harare Africa First Prize (2020). The Leeds-based artist who grew up in London said growing up in the UK has been a blessing in disguise as it afforded her the chance to connect with fellow countrymen. “The UK is a great place to be an artist, however, not being quite fully British has led me to a place where I began pursuing my roots in order to understand who I am. Shanduko to me is a marker in my life where I have begun to look back at my Zimbabwean roots and explore my cultural heritage along with my blackness and womanhood. “I’m grateful to Richard Mudariki of ArtHarare for providing a route to connecting with Zimbabwe and other Zimbabwean artists in an artist community that goes beyond borders. “It’s been so enlightening being involved in this group exhibition curated by Richard. I’ve been able to learn a lot about the challenges faced by my contemporaries in Zimbabwe and how they are overcoming them. I’ve also learnt that people and the community are a common thread in our works,” she said. Rubaya has carved a niche for herself in the creative field but she is also involved in the Biomedical Science field where she works as a software test analyst.  “I have a 9-5 job as a software test analyst. I feel like there’s been a myth built up especially on social media that creatives just create content and it’s all roses thereafter. I find power and solace in my day job. I enjoy it as it challenges me in new ways every day. “It literally keeps me on my toes and it gives me a forced break from thinking about art. Also, because of it, I have the luxury of being able to accept only commissions that I’m truly excited about and have conversations with potential collectors of my work knowing that my bills and food – for as long as I have a job are covered. This helps me to clearly identify and avoid the potentially-exploitative situations that are experienced by artists, freelancers and budding business owners. “I’m an advocate for people doing both for as long as they are able to. There’s no shame in being a creative with a 9-5. You don’t have to choose one. The beauty about being a creative and multi-potentialite is that you get to carve your own path,”she said. Rubaya builds on the figurative work produced by Kerry James Marshall and Barkley L Hendricks and Amy Sherald, creating a style that is distinct and uniquely hers. <img class="wp-image-625846 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Christopher Doyle Artists and cinematographers such as Alma Thomas, Zhao Xiaoding and Christopher Doyle have influenced her use of colour as language. Deviating from her earlier work, Linnet has sought to depict the vibrancy and beauty of the world despite the expectation of misery. Stab the Rubayas and you will see that they bleed art! Linnet Rubaya is siblings to producer and artiste, Lucian Rubaya who is known in the music circles as Black Orient. Asked how she relates to music, Rubaya said sometimes she titles her work of art after song titles and lyrics. “Music inspires me. I find that a lot of my paintings are titled as derivatives of song titles or a line within a song. But no, I don’t sing, produce or do anything musical,” she said. Rubaya said perseverance is the antidote needed by artists if they are to make a name for themselves in the sector. “I would like to urge artists to keep on creating. Create despite, in spite, because of…just create,” said Rubaya as a parting shot. – @eMKlass_49
