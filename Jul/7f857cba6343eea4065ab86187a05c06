They were reduced to 37/3 in 5.4 overs after the departure of skipper Craig Ervine, Regis Chakabva and Wessley Madhevere. Williams, however, stood tall and notched up his ninth half ton in this format of the game. The left-hander got to the milestone with a boundary off the bowling of Julius Sumerauer. After Williams fell, Jongwe ensured that Zimbabwe got a decent total with some good knocks. To win, Zimbabwe had to ensure that their bowling and fielding was on point and they did just that. What was crucial for Zimbabwe was to stifle run scoring opportunities for Jersey to up the run rate. Leg-spinner Ryan Burl bowled brilliantly to finish with three wickets for 13 runs in four overs. There was a wicket each for Tendai Chatara and Blessing Muzarabani. Chatara walked off the field holding his shoulder after falling awkwardly while fielding and Zimbabwe will be hoping he recovers in time for the match against USA. <img class="wp-image-627082 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwean batsmen Sikandar Raza and Sean Williams in action against Jersey at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo yesterday In the afternoon match played at the same venue, Netherlands also secured their place in the semi-finals with a seven-wicket win over Hong Kong.
