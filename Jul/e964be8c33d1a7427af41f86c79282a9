THE private sector has been urged to work closely with the Government to drive successful economic projects implementation as the nation marches towards attaining an upper middle-income status by 2030. Director for economic development in the Midlands Province, Mr Kosheni Mtisi, said this in remarks during a Kwekwe District Private Sector Stakeholders meeting held in the mining town last week. The meeting was organised by the Kwekwe District Development Coordinator’s economics department to forge an alliance between the private players and Government departments. Kwekwe is home to key mining, industrial, manufacturing and farming operations but is still lagging behind in terms of infrastructural development. “The country doesn’t belong to the Government but to the people. Government is only there to create a conducive environment for you (private players) to be able to operate,” said Mr Mtisi. <img class="wp-image-627847 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> farming operations “This is the reason why we are here today so that we can listen to your concerns and work on improving them.I have noted that some companies go to an extent of importing raw material from other countries yet the same raw material is found at a company next door. Forums like this one should be able to bring us together and be able to share products that we have,” said Mr Mtisi. His sentiments came after an official from ZimChem raised concern that they were producing one of the cheapest road-making materials but have never sold it to any local company. Given the abundant resources available in Kwekwe, Mr Mtisi said the district should be open for the most developed cities in the country. “This is one of the richest cities in Zimbabwe but for us to develop our city, let’s rely one upon another and create synergies and see how we can work together,” he said. “Where we feel we need the Government for assistance, let us approach the Government for assistance so that we unlock the potential that the city has.”  Different speakers lamented the bad state of roads in Kwekwe, which they said did not depict the riches in the area. Silobela-Nkayi Road was one of the roads discussed by the meeting as stakeholders complained about its adverse impact on business. The road links Kwekwe and Silobela where Jena Mines and other irrigation schemes are located. Stakeholders also raised concern over some infrastructure like Shamwari Hotel, which has been under renovations for close to a decade as well as lack of key infrastructure like a Government complex in the city. Kwekwe City director of works, Engineer John Mhike, said the contractors being given work by the Government to repair roads were letting them down. <img class="wp-image-627850 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-43-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-43-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-43-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> bad state of roads “The rate of failure by contractors under the ERRP is shocking. As we speak, we are in the process of revoking contracts for some who failed to do the job as required,” he said. “But we are working to make sure that the roads are repaired.” Kwekwe DDC, Mr Fortune Mpungu, said they were in the process of formulating a district economic blueprint derived from the national one in line with devolution. He hailed the Kwekwe business community for standing with the Government throughout the Covid-19 induced lockdowns through supply of various things like fuel and others. The meeting was attended by representatives from companies, mining companies, industry, farmers, as well as the business representatives.
