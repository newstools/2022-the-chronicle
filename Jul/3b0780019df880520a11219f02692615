THREE suspected armed robbers who allegedly broke into a Kwekwe house where they fatally assaulted a woman and left two other family members seriously injured before getting away with US$312 and other valuables have been remanded in custody. The trio reportedly broke into a house in Mbizo 18 and was later arrested in Gokwe. Hardlife Mushipe (26), Liberty Chipanga (22) and Trust Chipanga (23) appeared before Kwekwe Magistrate Ms Mildred Matuvi facing murder and two counts of robbery.  She remanded them in custody to July 21. In opposing bail, the State, led by Miss Nyasha Hloka argued that the accused persons have previous convictions and Mushipe is a habitual criminal who was once convicted for a similar offence. The State also argued that they are likely to abscond as there is overwhelming evidence against them. Ms Matuvi, however, urged the trio to apply for bail at the High Court. It is the State’s case that on July 2 at around 1am, the trio went to number 18958/18 owned by Mr Kudakwashe  Muurungi armed with logs, hoe handles and stones. <img class="wp-image-625741 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> iron bar They forced open the main door using an iron bar and gained entry. They beat up a heavily pregnant Ms Cecilia Musha who surrendered her mobile phone. They then proceeded to Mr Muurungi’s bedroom where he was sleeping with his wife Ms Pretty Mxotshwa. “They covered him with a blanket and assaulted him with a log on the head demanding cash. He surrendered US$12 but they demanded more cash and continued assaulting him,” the court heard. The trio also assaulted Ms Mxotshwa with logs all over the body until she gave them US$300. <img class="wp-image-625738 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-19-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-19-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-19-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> blood They dragged Ms Mxotshwa outside while assaulting her with logs and left her lying in a pool of blood and she later died on the same spot.
