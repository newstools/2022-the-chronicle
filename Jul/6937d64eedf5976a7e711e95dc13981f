The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter WHAT started as a pastime during the Covid-19 lockdown has today turned into a full-time business venture for Mr Tselapili Bedza (40) of Beitbridge who now operates a small, but lucrative carpentry and joinery business, which he has blended with interior design. Mr Bedza capitalised on the temporary setback brought about by the lockdown to start and gradually grow his enterprise. This was after losing his job as a cross-border transport operator following the prolonged closure of the country’s inland borders due to Covid-19. Zimbabwe and South Africa closed their borders to general human traffic in March 2020 when they effected their first 21-day lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19. The closure of Beitbridge Border Post, the busiest inland port of entry in sub-Saharan Africa that is shared by Zimbabwe and South Africa, affected mostly Zimbabweans who relied on cross-border travel.  Mr Bedza sustains his family of 12 through his ornamental work of joining pieces of wood to enhance the interior of commercial and residential properties. He operates from his backyard in Dulivhadzimu suburb in the border town and employs four people. Mr Bedza is in the process of registering his company, Lestar Interior Designs, which specialises mainly in interior designs, shopfitting, fitted kitchens and built-in-cabinets. “My journey in carpentry and joinery started in 2020 soon after Beitbridge Border Post was closed in March 2020 as part of the Covid-19 restrictions. As a cross-border transporter, I was left jobless hence I decided to venture into carpentry and joinery as a pastime,” he said. Mr Bedza said his late father played a major role in shaping his career path by grooming him at a tender age. He however, didn’t bother himself by developing the craft until the lockdown which eventually led him to a full-time carpenter. <img class="size-full wp-image-628597" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/today8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/today8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/today8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bedza’s works “I was a cross border transporter and when the borders closed due to Covid-19, it dawned on me that I had carpentry and joinery skills imparted to me by my late father. Initially it was more of a hobby, but surprisingly people liked my work,” said Mr Bedza. “I then thought of venturing into carpentry full time, which has kept me going until today. I specialise in interior designs, shopfitting, fitted kitchens and just last year I started doing cupboard designs.” Mr Bedza targets markets in Beitbridge and other parts of the country. “I have done a sizeable number of jobs for local clients and also managed to secure a lucrative contract from one of the big companies in Beitbridge,” he said. Mr Bedza said the major challenge that he is facing is the issue of tools. “This trade requires sophisticated carpentry tools. A carpenter’s peculiar treasure is the toolbox and the bigger your collection of tools, the greater your flexibility and excellence,” he said. “I use gloss and super texture boards to make wardrobes, fitted kitchen and built-in-cabinets. The prices for wardrobes range from US$160 and US$280 for fitted kitchens depending on size and type of material.” Through carpentry and joinery, Mr Bedza has managed to build a modern homestead and bought a residential stand, which he is in the process of developing. “Carpentry has also enabled me to pay school fees for my children and looking after my mother, grandmother and siblings,” he said. Mr Bedza said as the company grows, he hopes to incorporate technology in the production process and create more employment for youths. — @mashnets
