THE National Society Security Authority (Nssa) has sent its general manager, Mr Arthur Manase, on forced leave to pave way for investigations over corruption allegations. <img class="wp-image-610462 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-107.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-107.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-107-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Security Authority (Nssa) The pensions body recently came under fire amid several suspicions of corrupt dealings involving massive financial mismanagement levelled against senior managers, which have prompted public criticism by President Mnangagwa and concerned policy holders. In a statement published yesterday, Nssa chairman Dr Percy Toriro, said the board was working closely with the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc), and other key agencies to interrogate the serious matter. <img class="wp-image-624178 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) “Stakeholders must have followed with concern several allegations of problems at Nssa over the past few months,” he said. “The challenges are multi-layered and could be attributed to a variety of factors. A comprehensive investigation has been instituted to get to the bottom of the matters. “To support this and ensure that the exercise is conducted in an independent and transparent environment, the board is sending the general manger on leave until the exercise is complete,” said Dr Toriro. Following accusations of Nssa and the Zimbabwe National Pensioners Forum Trust (ZNPFT) being allegedly engaged in corruption and misgovernance, the authority had responded by issuing a statement in which it dismissed the allegations as a deliberate ploy to derail the good work that the two have jointly accomplished in improving the welfare of pensioners.  ZNPFT is a registered trust that seeks to promote the welfare of Nssa pensioners and beneficiaries. Dr Toriro said the board fully supports all investigations into NSSA operations as it believes this will restore confidence in the strategic organisation. “The board has in the interim time appointed Dr Charles Shava, director of occupational safety and health as the acting general manager to ensure business continuity while the investigations take place,” said Dr Toriro. — @SikhulekelaniM1
