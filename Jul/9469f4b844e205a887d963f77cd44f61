It paved the way for me to get recognition as I have been able to win the Outstanding Kwaito Artist in the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards and since then, the goal has been to inspire the young generation, “ he said.  Mawiza said his latest offering cements who he is and his mission in the music business. “This one is about continuity. My goal and vision have always been to inspire the young to carry forward what I have started concerning music. Being the product of the ghetto, l am still and always the voice of the ghetto, “ said Mawiza.

Kay Media Africa (Zimbabwe) in conjunction with Reprezent Radio (UK) with support from the British Council and Swiss Agency for Development and Co-Operation (SDC) launched the Scripts and Bars project.

Mawiza has been keeping himself busy with Script and Bars programmes, the latest being the Interstellar Residency where he played the audience to a cultural exchange program a few weeks ago. “I was chosen for the Script and Bars program. It caters to creative individuals within the 18-35-year age group who have a minimum of two years of being actively involved with music, literature, or digital content creation. This is what I have been doing, simultaneously with the recording of my latest EP. It has been quite a rollercoaster ride lately, “ added Mawiza. – @eMKlass_49
