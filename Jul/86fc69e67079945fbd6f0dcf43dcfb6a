SIX more cattle have been donated by farmers from Matabeleland region to the Nkayi family that lost 21 cattle last month bringing to 19 the total number of donated beasts. The family lost cattle after dozing them with a deadly grain protectant.  Two weeks ago, the family received a donation of 13 cattle, 12 heifers and one bull. Last Friday, four heifers and one bull left for the Mpofu homestead at Dolahali area in Nhlekisa Village from the Bulawayo Veterinary offices after being cleared while the sixth cow was donated by someone in Nkayi. The truck which transported the cattle was loaded with bales of fodder and cattle vaccines donated by well-wishers. A representative of the farmers, Mr Obert Chinhamo said there is one cow which was donated but could not be processed which would have taken the number of received cattle to 20. <img class="wp-image-626326 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Obert Chinhamo He said farmers have closed the campaign to assist the family and hailed the support from various stakeholders who assisted the Mpofu family. “We have managed to mobilise 18 cattle and another we gather has been donated in Nkayi. “More than US$2 000 was also donated and this is the money which funded the movement of the cattle from the farms to Bulawayo and then Nkayi,” said Mr Chinhamo. He said after the story broke out in the Chronicle a farmer, Mr Scotch Dube was the first to volunteer to donate followed by Dr Dlodlo of Nguni Brahman. <img class="wp-image-626329 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-33-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-33-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-33-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nguni Brahman He said through their networks as farmers, they mobilised donations which they hope will transform the Mpofu family. “We would like to see a successful cattle project in Nkayi starting from the donated cattle. It is important for the family to be able to look after these cattle in a good condition. “We will not be auditing the cattle but the most important thing is to hear a good story coming out of Nkayi regarding this donation. It will be a big story for the Mpofu family and everyone else who has made a donation,” said Mr Chinhamo. — @themkhust
