The wound is still fresh but today we don’t want to cry and mourn but to celebrate his legacy and achievements. “Dr Nkomo ran his race, he left us all a legacy, a gift and present for our nation and that for our future generations to emulate.” Minister Ncube described the late Dr Nkomo as a selfless leader who put the interests of others ahead of his own and those of his immediate family. “Dr Nkomo was a nationalist and a pan-Africanist who worked selflessly and tirelessly for Zimbabwe. He dedicated his entire adult life to fighting for the liberation of Zimbabwe from the yoke of oppression and colonialism,” she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-603666" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-22-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-22-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-22-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube “He led his people to freedom and cultivated unity across the length and breadth of Zimbabwe. He believed in inclusiveness and unity, he loved all people in Zimbabwe regardless of race, tribe, class and ethnicity. He hated regionalism, he hated racism, and oppression.” Minister Ncube said reconciliation in the country was best expressed in the 1987 Unity Accord, which brought to an end the civil strife of the early 1980s commonly known as Gukurahundi. “Even in the darkest times of a menacing dark cloud of potential civil strife and terror in the early 1980s, Dr Nkomo’s desire for unity prevailed leading to the signing of the Unity accord in 1987,” she said. “This development brought peace and tranquillity with Zimbabwe becoming a model of unity and peace in Africa and the world at large. This put to shame the hand of detractors who sought to put us at war.” Minister Ncube said Dr Nkomo was never a regional leader but was a nationalist par excellence who appealed to Zimbabweans from all walks of life hence his title ‘Father Zimbabwe’. “Dr Nkomo, the pioneer of peace believed in peace and reconciliation. He believed that in order to achieve great things, we must unite as a nation. He also believed that our prosperity lies in the land,” she said.  Cde Ncube said the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa was appreciative of key role-played Dr Nkomo and castigated opposition political elements that belittle the liberation stalwart’s legacy by restricting him to Matabeleland and claiming that he sold out by signing the Unity Accord. Dr Nkomo’s daughter, Mrs Thandiwe-Nkomo-Ebrahim paid tribute to the Second Republic for recognising and honouring their father’s legacy and received a gift in the form of a tractor from President Mnangagwa. She said the gift was relevant to her father’s memory as he was passionate about agriculture and the empowerment of all Zimbabweans. “We knew our father did not belong to us alone but we understood that he was the father to so many people and we are comforted by the numbers of so many people who still remember him like we do, 23 years later,” said Mrs Nkomo-Ebrahim. “We are very grateful to the President for this thoughtful gift, a tractor.”
