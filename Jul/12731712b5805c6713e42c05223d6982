The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
VICTORIA Falls Tennis Club wants to develop the game in the resort city, but lack of funding and scarcity of facilities is hampering its efforts. The club was formed in 2014 by members from around Hwange district with a vision to promote the sport at grassroots level. “The challenges we face include lack of tennis courts, especially in Matabeleland North, and we still need to break the belief that tennis is an elite sport. “We also lack funding to promote the sport at grassroots level,” said club chairman Warren Mthabisi Ncube, who is also the Matabeleland North Tennis Board chair.  Despite the setbacks, the club has hosted an annual tournament in Victoria Falls and participated in tournaments in Harare, Bulawayo, Matopo and Vumba. At the weekend it played and beat Bulawayo Athletic Club. Ncube implored the local authority to invest in sport for the benefit of the community. “We have two established teams at the moment, but we want to grow the sport across Matabeleland North. We had an invitational seniors’ tournament against our hosts BAC, an affiliate of the Bulawayo Metropolitan Board, and we won. Ours is to promote wellness and domestic tourism through sport. <img class="wp-image-626653 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-4-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-4-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-4-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Athletic Club “As chairman, I encourage individuals and companies to value wellness programmes through exercise and sport, and for Zimbabweans to explore the beauty and grandeur of our country through sports. “I challenge the city fathers in Victoria Falls to build a sports complex that will house all codes in line with the recently acquired city status. We also encourage Government and private organisations to provide such infrastructure in all districts in this province,” said Ncube.  Only Hwange district has standard tennis courts in Matabeleland North. Victoria Falls Tennis Club uses Elephant Hills courts for training and matches. — @ncubeleon
