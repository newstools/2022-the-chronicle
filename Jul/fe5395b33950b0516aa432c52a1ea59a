A total of 258 Ward 21 residents in Bulawayo have signed a petition for the closure of an illegal nightclub nicknamed Migalo in Sizinda, saying it was causing violent crimes in the area. Residents of the high-density suburb blame Power Foods Butchery, which according to them is operating as an illegal nightclub, for the spate of violent crimes. Earlier this month, residents from the suburb woke up to a gory scene of a bloodied body of a man, Alson Moyo (36), who was reportedly stabbed and killed just 50 metres from his house. Angry residents called for the closure of Migalo at Richards Shopping Centre where beer is illegally sold. <img class="wp-image-629488 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-224.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-224.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-224-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beer The deceased’s father, Mr Fanyana Samson Moyo said Alson was buried last Thursday at Umvutsha Park Cemetery in Bulawayo, adding that the family was still in mourning. According to a petition gleaned by Chronicle, Ward 21 residents said: “As residents of Ward 21, we call for the closure of the illegal operation of a night spot, behind Past 7 Shopping Centre in Sizinda. We call for this action as we have noticed stabbings of individuals and the death of another on the 10th of July 2022.” Ward 21 councillor Tinevimbo Maposa said Power Foods Butchery was operating an illegal nightspot. “We met with stakeholders, and there is consensus that it (Migalo) has to close. We also met the police and they were clear that the law must take its course regarding the operations of that place. The place does not have a licence to sell beer, and it is supposed to be a butchery as per their licence,” said Clr Maposa. <img class="wp-image-613147 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council (BCC) Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association secretary for administration Mr Thembelani Dube said the petition has been signed and taken to Bulawayo City Council offices. He said residents are concerned by acts of thuggery and deaths in their neighbourhood. “The petition has 258 signatures of residents in Ward 21. The residents are simply exercising their constitutional right to express their displeasure regarding the bar that has been opened there and which is causing a lot of thuggery activities. At the same time there’s a lot of noise pollution and other nefarious activities taking place around that bar,” said Mr Dube.  He said BPRA urges authorities and business people to consult with residents first before they open such establishments. “Before any establishment opens, that is likely to interfere with the rights of the residents that establishment must first of all consult with the residents so that they get the green light. There’s a need for continuous liaising with the residents’ leadership by the establishment so that they know their concerns,” said Mr Dube. <img class="wp-image-610744 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Inspectors-Abednico-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Inspectors-Abednico-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Inspectors-Abednico-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said they were still investigating the case and they will continue doing raids. – @bonganinkunzi
