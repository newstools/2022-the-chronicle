THE Zanu-PF Matabeleland North Youth League has endorsed President Mnangagwa as the ruling party’s Presidential candidate for the 2023 harmonised elections. The party’s provincial Youth League held an inter district meeting at the party’s provincial offices in Lupane recently and endorsed President Mnangagwa as the sole candidate, saying the Second Republic should be allowed to complete numerous projects being implemented in various provinces and the country pushes towards an upper middle income society by the year 2022. <img class="wp-image-606754 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde John Paradza The party’s deputy secretary for Youth Affairs Cde John Paradza was the guest of honour at the meeting. Cde Paradza implored youths to strive to promote peace both in the party and in their communities. He said the party will continue to empower youths through various projects and encouraged members to take advantage of the programmes being spearheaded by the Second Republic under the leadership of President Mnangagwa. “Matabeleland North is endowed with various resources such as mineral deposits, timber and other economic enablers in tourism.  As youth we should position ourselves in these various economic activities. We will help each other get claims especially in mining since your province has many gold mines, timber and tourism. “Let’s remain united as youths and community,” he said. <img class="wp-image-624268 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF The party’s provincial youth chair for Matabeleland North Cde Alvin Lundy Sinzeka said the inter-district meeting was organised to mobilise youth to register to vote for the revolutionary party Zanu-PF, as well as listen to challenges faced by youths in the province. “We want to thank the Deputy Youth Affairs Cde Paradza for coming to teach us about unity, peace and development. The meeting’s resolution was that President Mnangagwa is our candidate for the 2023 election. We will stand by him as the Youth League in the province,” said Cde Sinzeka. He said some of the major challenges highlighted by youths were around lack of access to empowerment projects as empowerment banks visit to collect proposals but few have got the loans. He said most of the demands made by banks were beyond the reach of many youths who have no collateral. “Youths want to get into mining, farming and tourism sectors but access is difficult,” he said. -@ncubeleon
