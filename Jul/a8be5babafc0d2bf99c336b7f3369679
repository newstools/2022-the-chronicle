The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter R&B/SOUL and Afro-beats songwriter, producer and sound engineer Troy Larmain has embarked on a rebranding exercise and has changed his stage name to AZIEL. With new beginnings being the artist’s foundation for growth, AZIEL has released his second album titled Issues. The 17-track album has songs that include Boss Moves featuring Luminous, Short Temper featuring Helen Nyati and Bella featuring Khid Marque. “I believe when you are on a journey, you get to learn a lot of things as you travel, and this has been my case in the music industry, where l was still trying to find the right sound. “Rebranding from Troy Larmain to AZIEL is one of the outcomes of me finding my place in the music industry. I have made sure the new stage name makes an impact through the release of the Issues album. The album talks about love, trust issues, heartbreaks, depression and hustling,” said AZIEL.
