The people in Matabeleland South are not difficult to deal with, we just have to deliver what they want. If there’s an electricity fault anywhere, let’s rush and fix it. If there’s a land dispute, let’s solve it,” said Cde Ndlovu. He applauded various Government departments for putting their best foot forward and ensuring President Mnangagwa’s vision of an upper middle-income society by 2030 is achieved. “As Zanu-PF we want to appreciate what you’re doing to help our people. Where you’re not doing anything, we’ll make sure that you do something,” said Cde Ndlovu. Under the Second Republic, the Government has stepped up efforts to implement key development projects in the Matabeleland region in line with the devolution policy and Vision 2030.  Some of the notable key projects include Lake Gwayi-Shangani in Matabeleland North and Tuli-Manyange Dam as well as Beitbridge Border Post modernisation project, both in Matabeleland South. Several irrigation schemes have been established in the region while many others have been rehabilitated to enhance food security and nutrition. More than 20 health facilities are under construction in Matabeleland South as the Government moves to improve access to medical services. – @Yolisswa
