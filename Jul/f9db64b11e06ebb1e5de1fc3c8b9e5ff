The Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme will be extended to 3,5 million households for the 2022/2023 summer cropping season, and the Government has already released $20 billion towards the goal, as efforts to ensure food security continue. This year’s target means an additional 1,2 million households will benefit from the Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme, after 2,3 million households participated. Beneficiaries would be drawn from communal farmers, A1 farmers and those settled in old resettlement areas and peri-urban farmers, chief director for strategic planning and business development in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Mr Clemence Bwenje, said yesterday. <img class="size-full wp-image-600407" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Clemence-Tapererwa-Bwenje.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Clemence-Tapererwa-Bwenje.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Clemence-Tapererwa-Bwenje-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Clemence Tapererwa Bwenje, He said this during a capacity building workshop for Parliament’s Agriculture Portfolio Committee that was meant to enhance legislators’ capacity in monitoring and tracking the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) allocated to the ministry. The workshop, which was held in conjunction with the Southern Africa Parliamentary Support Trust, was also aimed at monitoring the implementation of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) projects in the agricultural sector.  The Pfumvudza/Intwasa is a conservation agriculture scheme that was adopted by the Government to boost yields especially for communal and smallholder farmers who do not have access to irrigation. The scheme was adopted in light of the erratic rains the country has been receiving in the past few years that has affected yields. Said Mr Bwenje: “The Pfumvudza scheme is targeting 3,5 million households in communal areas, A1 farmers, old resettlement areas and peri-urban farmers (this year). The programme will target crops such as maize, traditional grains, beans, sunflower and vegetables. The input pack will include water retention enhancers that will enhance the water retention capacity of the soil. “You understand that the issue of mulch in most of our areas is a challenge so these water retention enhancers will come in handy.” <img class="size-full wp-image-597699" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Pfumvudza-Intwasa-fields.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Pfumvudza-Intwasa-fields.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Pfumvudza-Intwasa-fields-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pfumvudza Intwasa fields Mr Bwenje said the Government had also introduced the National Enhancement Agricultural Productivity Scheme under which 225 000 hectares of land would be put under maize, soya beans and sugar beans. He said farmers would be chosen depending on which crop was suitable for their ecological region. Farmer organisations yesterday welcomed the extension of the Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme to more households saying the move will increase yields. Zimbabwe Farmers Union president Mr Abdul Nyathi said: “Pfumvudza has never disappointed since it was introduced. It has been a successful story benefiting both small-scale farmers and commercial farmers. <img class="size-full wp-image-516087" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Mr-Abdul-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Mr-Abdul-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Mr-Abdul-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Abdul Nyathi “As farmers we appreciate the Government for initiating Pfumvudza and increasing the number of households benefiting because it is very reliable and they will see an increased yield. “It is guaranteed that we are given everything that we need including the seed and the yield gives room for exporting maize.”
Zimbabwe Integrated Commercial Farmers’ Union (ZICFU) president, Ms Maiwepi Jiti, said increasing the number of beneficiaries will capacitate more farmers.
