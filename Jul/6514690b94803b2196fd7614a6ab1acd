The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter Rapper Luminous has extended his portfolio with the release of his debut book titled Confessions of a fornicator and an EP titled Love, Sex and the Gospel (LSG) slated for Friday. The Ungay’vusa singer who is known for his high-energy stage performances has since channelled his energy to authorship.  He said the book is a confessional of sex and religion. “The confessions of a fornicator is exactly what the title suggests, confessions. It’s Christian literature and is a story of a boy raised in a Christian family, but struggles with lust and addiction. “We follow his journey to healing and his fight to hold onto a faith that saved him. In our society, topical issues involving sex are taboo so I’m opening a can of worms, with the hope of helping someone make informed decisions on sexual matters,” said Luminous. In this project, Luminous worked closely with the British Council, Kay Media Africa, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Corporation. <img class="wp-image-629824 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> British Council The LSG EP is a conceptual project with eight tracks.
