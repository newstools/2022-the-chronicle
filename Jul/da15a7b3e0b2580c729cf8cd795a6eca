Bulawayo-bred Kimberley Richards (born Chigubu) who is dating Holy Ten said this is her first single as she grows her creative career which has largely been in modelling. She said working with her partner was interesting. “I’m excited as this was my first time to record a song. Working with Holy Ten was an amazing experience as he pushed me to record, despite how much I resisted as I wasn’t sure of myself. But nevertheless, he got me to record and surprisingly, the feedback has been humbling,” said Kimberley Richards. The second-year Political Science and Diplomacy student at the University of Zimbabwe said she joined the creative industry out of passion.  “I honestly can’t say I was inspired by anyone to join the industry as I naturally found myself in this space. Feedback from the people liking me for simply being me gave me the confidence in what I was doing and here I am.” She seems to have a flourishing career as a model as she was crowned the 2020 Miss UZ first princess and is the reigning Miss UZ Most influential personality 2022. “I also hold the best model/video vixen and Best Event Host titles,” she said. Balancing work and school, Kim said can be challenging as it can get overwhelming. “School and my career are both demanding of my time but generally, I’ve been moving quite swiftly,” she said. To those who want to join the arts industry, the beauty queen had this to say: “Consistency and hard work are fundamental. In the beginning, it may seem like it’s not working out, but with time, you’ll start seeing results.” Apparently, Holy Ten and Kimberly Richards have been together for a considerable amount of time. <img class="wp-image-429254 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Beyonce-Jay-Z-on-stage-in-SA.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Beyonce-Jay-Z-on-stage-in-SA.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Beyonce-Jay-Z-on-stage-in-SA-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beyonce Knowles-Carter and Jay Z Now, with the pair collaborating on a song, a carbon copy of Brangelina (a couple consisting of celebrities Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) or a Jay-Z and Beyonce is on the horizon.
