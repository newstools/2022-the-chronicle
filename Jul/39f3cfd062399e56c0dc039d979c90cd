GWERU councillors have been accused of opposing development in the city after turning down a request by a Harare-based company to develop the local authority’s works yard into a shopping mall. With the refurbishment of Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus into a modern facility in line with the smart city concept spearheaded by the Government — the council works yard is now an eyesore.  The beauty of Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus is being shadowed by the works yard. The works yard is a site primarily used by the City of Gweru for the maintenance, repair, and storage of equipment, vehicles and other goods used by the local authority in the delivery of services. There is also an accessory administrative office at the works yard. This site was a point of discussion during the recent City of Gweru ordinary full council meeting held at the town house. During the meeting, councillors agreed not to accede to the request of partnering with Bentach Resources to dismantle the council’s yard and build a shopping mall. This was after Bentach Resources, the same company that rehabilitated Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus requested to turn the works yard into a state-of-the-art shopping mall to benefit residents and the council. According to the recommendation from the business committee presented during the ordinary full council meeting: “The development will change the face of Gweru and is expected to bring in more business and assist in bringing revenue for the city council. Bentach Resources entered into a 15-year lease with the local authority after it renovated the Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus at a cost of about US$2 million.” Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus was officially opened by President Mnangagwa who hailed the public-private partnership between the local authority and Bentach Resources. <img class="wp-image-602223 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-55-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-55-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-55-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Ward 16 Councillor Tawanda Magidi urged the cash-strapped local authority to reconsider its decision and allow the construction of the shopping mall. “Why are we refusing a shopping mall for the betterment of our city? It’s better to have a shopping mall that can give us the revenue than keeping the works yard in the central business district,” he argued. His argument was turned down by the deputy Mayor Councillor Cleopas Shiri supported by predominantly Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) councillors. Clr Shiri who was chairing the meeting said: “Council is not prepared for that hence the request is rejected.” Sources at the town house accused CCC councillors of hatching a plan to derail development of the city. <img class="wp-image-625177 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Citizens Coalition for Change They said the decisions to do with development outside the council chambers are always aimed at frustrating development. “You see, these councillors are becoming anti-development because the coming of modern development is shutting them out in terms of corruption. Look at Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus, they used to be space barons running multiple vending stalls. Now they have been kicked out after Bentach renovated the terminus. Even rank marshals are no longer harassing passengers and that is the development they are against because they don’t have control of funds,” said a councillor close to the matter. Another councillor said even the coming in of City Parking to run the streets of the central business district saw another of councillors’ source of revenue diminishing. “Remember City of Gweru was running at a loss when it was controlling the parking department. The city was always in the negative as cartels ran the city parking department. Some revenue was not banked and some funds were transferred from council accounts. But when City Parking came, it meant no more interference by councillors and their cartels and that irked them. The same with works yard, they ran operations from there and don’t want it developed,” said the councillor. Council procured a $14 million backhoe loader using the share of revenue from City Parking which wasn’t well received by councillors and some anti-development residents.
