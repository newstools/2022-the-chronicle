The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Health Reporter HYPERTENSION, diabetes and HIV account for more than half of the chronic diseases prevalent in Zimbabwean households as Government continues to incorporate non-communicable diseases (NCDs) into primary health care. Statistics from the recent Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVAC) show that the three diseases remain prevalent in homes from a list of about 14 illnesses. Other chronic diseases include heart disease, asthma, hypertension, arthritis, epilepsy, stroke, cancer, tuberculosis, liver diseases, kidney diseases and ulcers. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that about 39 percent of Zimbabweans may be suffering from the silent killers which are part of the leading causes of death. <img class="size-full wp-image-620698" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> World Health Organization (WHO) People living in urban areas are at a higher risk of hypertension based on their usually sedentary lifestyles. Eating a healthier diet with less salt, exercising regularly and taking medication can help lower blood pressure and these lifestyle-related behaviours have been proven to be effective in preventing and treating hypertension and diabetes. “Of all the chronic illnesses, HIV and Aids (25,5 percent) and hypertension/high blood pressure (25,4 percent) constituted over half of the conditions recorded during the assessment,” read the report. “At least 25,5 percent household members were suffering from HIV, 10 percent from diabetes while 25,4 percent reported to be suffering from hypertension. Matabeleland North and South provinces have the highest number of households with members living with HIV at 35,5 percent and 36,3 percent respectively.” In terms of diabetes, Midlands and Mashonaland West provinces have the highest family members suffering from the chronic illness while Mashonaland East and Manicaland dominated in terms of hypertension.  In a statement, the acting Ministry of Health and Child Care director for Oral Health Dr Hardwicke Matikiti said in light of the disease burden, Zimbabwe was focusing on NCDs with keen interest and incorporating them into primary health care programmes. “Regarding non-communicable diseases, we continue to pay particular attention to their management in view of their increase in the population by integrating them into primary health care. The country is engaged in massive awareness-raising and in addressing the risk factors,” said Dr Matikiti. “On diabetes prevention and control, we believe it is important to raise its priority in view of the increase in premature mortality. We are also concerned that people with NCDs, including diabetes, are at a higher risk of becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19,” he added. <img class="size-full wp-image-577286" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mr-Itai-Rusike.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mr-Itai-Rusike.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mr-Itai-Rusike-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Itai Rusike Contacted for comment, the Community Working Group on Health (CWGH) director Mr Itai Rusike said funds are needed to set up the promotion, public health controls, prevention, early detection management of chronic illnesses. “Zimbabwe is experiencing an increase in chronic conditions such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes that are more expensive to treat not only for the health sector but also for the economy. Early interventions are an ideal investment which will help us avoid costs related to treating these illnesses,” he said. — @thamamoe
