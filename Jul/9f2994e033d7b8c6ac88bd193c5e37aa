He said the focus is now turned to production and productivity. “We remember fondly, all your teachings and on this day, we take pride in knowing that you rest in eternal peace. Zanu-PF shall forever cherish the peace, tranquillity and harmony brought about by the 1987 Unity Accord which bears his signature,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-556926" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo “His indelible signature remains dear to all our people because it ushered in the fruits of peace and development that we continue to enjoy today.” Dr Nkomo’s wish was to see Zimbabweans of all races united and this desire for a united Zimbabwe saw him leading the then PF Zapu to sign the 1987 Unity Accord with Zanu-PF.  The late Vice-President had a strong vision anchored on equality for all and a determined drive to develop all parts of the country, which the Second Republic has magnified in a big way through its philosophy of ‘leaving no one and no place behind.’ Cde Mutsvangwa said Zanu PF and its leadership under the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa remains alert and ready to confront every challenge that comes its way. – @mashnets.
