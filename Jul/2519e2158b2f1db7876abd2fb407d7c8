The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent MORE than 2 000 people in Kwekwe received free diagnostics and treatment of diseases courtesy of the Indian Embassy and the Kwekwe Indian Business Community which conducted a free health camp at Sherwood Clinic on Sunday. The health camp in Ward 31 at Sherwood Block saw medical practitioners from Bulawayo and Kwekwe coming together to meet patients from the resettlement area most of whom cannot afford to travel long distances to access treatment. Tests and treatments were conducted on diseases ranging from tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes, HIV and asthma among other diseases with free medication being administered on the spot. Beneficiaries of the health camp commended the organisers of the event saying it had come as a relief to them. <img class="wp-image-513963 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Deputy-Minister-Raj-Modi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Deputy-Minister-Raj-Modi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Deputy-Minister-Raj-Modi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Raj Modi Mr Joel Mbano, who has been suffering from non-small cell lung cancer stage 2, said he was relieved after the Indian Embassy facilitated his trip to India for an operation. “I am very grateful to the Indian Embassy and the Kwekwe Indian Community at large for this gesture. I should be going to India in two months’ time for my operation. My condition was almost getting out of hand but I am really grateful for such initiatives as they come as life savers,” said Mr Mbano. One of the organisers, Mr Thakor Patel said the Kwekwe Indian Community took a leaf from Deputy Industry and Commerce Minister, Raj Modi who usually conducts such clinics in Bulawayo. “We noticed Mr Modi and the Ambassador conducting such initiatives in Bulawayo and we decided to replicate it here in Kwekwe and this is what it has culminated into. We then talked to them and they agreed to facilitate drugs and free medication,” said Mr Patel. He said this was one of the ways of giving back to the community. “We are giving back to the community, especially those in the rural parts as most of them struggle to access medication. We are grateful that we managed to facilitate free medication and treatment for the community,” he said. <img class="wp-image-632098 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-33-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-33-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-33-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> education Indian Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Vijay Khandula, who also attended the event, said the camp was part of India’s 75th Anniversary celebrations where a number of activities are lined up. “We are celebrating 75th years of India Independence and we are organising a number of activities including these people centred programmes across all provinces and this health camp is part of it. We are also organising cultural celebrations and other events but we wanted programmes that benefit the community the most,” he said. He described India’s relations with Zimbabwe as “ever improving” with many lines of trade being opened in other sectors like energy, education, health and ICT among others. <img class="wp-image-632101 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ICT Deputy Minister Modi said he was driven by the need to enhance Government efforts towards health delivery for the people especially in the rural parts. “We have been doing it in Bulawayo and we decided to take it to Kwekwe after we talked to Mr Patel. I am mainly driven by the need to ensure that everyone in Zimbabwe gets access to health,” he said. Ward 31 Councillor Tichafa Chitate also lauded the initiative which he said had come at the right time. “This is the best time for such an initiative and it has come as a panacea to most of the elderly people who had been suffering in homes either because they had to travel long distances to access health facilities or there are no drugs within health facilities,” said Clr Chitate.
