HE joined Twitter last month, has 43 Twitter followers, and very little else in the metaverse. But for the past few days, the fellow has touched the imaginations of many, inspired a few more, and been subject to a thread or two in the metaverse.  “Whenever I think of giving up on my dreams, I hear voices in my head shouting, ‘Hamba malume’ and that gets me going.” This is how one Twitter user has been positively affected by ‘malume’ – the online swimming sensation from South Africa also known as Welile Msomi in the real world or @msomiw44 in the metaverse. Malume the swimmer has been the talk on social media, topping the trends after he entered a swimming competition where he was the only black person. His swimming skills left a lot to be desired and got the world talking. Malume’s infamy was activated when one fan of his began cheering him on – “hamba malume”. And away he went, straight into a floating lane line. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628297 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-80.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-80.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-80-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He recovered admirably and began ‘swimming’ towards the finish. Malume who visibly could not swim, never quit the race even though he noticed he was last, and now memes and stickers have been made in dedication to “malume”. But why was the novice swimmer in the water in the first place? Well, his nephew was swimming at a school gala, and being the good, dutiful uncle he is, malume was there to provide moral support. One @gamfaya tweeted: “Malume knows nothing about swimming. He was just there to guard the school children where he works.” And Malume replied: “I don’t work at the school, I came to see my nephew swimming.” Malume also told people what happened when he dived into the swimming pool on the fateful day. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628300 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-81.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-81.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-81-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I hit the paving, let’s be thankful I didn’t die #kunzimaokwamalume.” And the thread began to grow, and so did the jibes. @NandosBW suggested: “Malume had a quarter chicken before swimming. And we all know the rules about eating before swimming.’ To which malume was very clear in his reply: “Malume didn’t have a quarter chicken, it was bablaas (emojis) kusho Mina umalume.” Our very own Croco Motors joined the bandwagon. The prominent car dealer tweeted a picture of a Ford and tagged it #HambaMalume #Malume #TheJourneyContinues #harare #zimbabwe before their tongue in cheek “If you know, you know” followed by emojis of laughter, a swimmer and a water wave. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628303 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-82.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-82.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-82-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> But many who followed the thread have been inspired while some have been supportive. Some Twitter followers of the thread recommended that he signs up for swimming lessons. Mabopane Auto Centre or @MACHUB2019 as they are known on Twitter donated swim gear to malume. The company said: “#uMalume swam his race and finished it to the end. As the MAC family, we’re also behind him and have offered to sponsor his swimming GEAR.” “We thank you #Malume for inspiring our nation, #swimmingmalumesmatter indeed,” they added. Whatever it is Malume is about, whichever school his nephew goes to, the metaverse is in love with this dude, and with his 43 Twitter followers, he is sure to have a little fun twarring! @RealSimbaJemwa
