The Chronicle Genesis 25:2 And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. (NKJV) Genesis 25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. (NKJV) Spiritual Blessings are different from material blessings.  One would rather possess a spiritual blessing than material blessing because wherever you go, you will possess and become what was pronounced over your life.  Abraham gave everything thing he had in the spirit. <img class="wp-image-603235 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible- Image taken from Shutterstock Genesis 25:6 But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the country of the east. (NKJV) Isaac prospered because he did not receive the tangible but he received the intangible blessings (spiritual blessings). All Abraham had was in Isaac spiritually. When Abraham was called by God he was not given material things but was given God’s blessings that are spiritual. The blessing of God is not receiving cars, money etc. but it is receiving spiritual blessings. Money operates by the blessing of God and the blessing of God is not tangible. The blessing of God is in you everywhere you go. You do not become a millionaire the day you start counting millions but the day you get blessed with millions in the spirit. Esau and Jacob were fighting for spiritual positions when they were still in the womb. Ashar means the happy one (blessing). When a Hebrew child is said to be blessed, they would have released the Ashar upon that person.  A good marriage and wisdom does not come with money as it is not a physical gift but it is a spiritual release unto someone.  Hebrews 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. (NKJV) Read Genesis 27:37 Blessings can be taken away from people.  A blessing is given spiritually and it can be taken spiritually. Maybe Esau had many things in the physical that could prove him to be the master but Jacob had riches that would later manifest in the spirit. He had nothing to show in the physical because the blessing was spiritual. Wine speaks of joy. Grain talks of prosperity. Spend your time concentrating on how you can receive the blessing from God, not materially for greater is the spiritual blessing. God Bless… eaglelifeassembly@yahoo.com
