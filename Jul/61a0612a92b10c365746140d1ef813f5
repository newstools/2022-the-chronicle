HIGHLANDERS have insisted that Joel Ngodzo is still their player following reports that the club has gotten rid of the midfielder. Ngodzo was reportedly on his way to Bulawayo City on loan as Bosso look to run down his contract. Bosso already have goalkeeper Reward Muza and striker Roddy Sibanda on loan at Amakhosi.  Ngodzo has reportedly failed to impress the new coaches and disciplinary issues are also believed to have put him on the exit front. Social media was yesterday awash with news that the midfielder had been sacked, but Bosso shot down the claims.
“Ngodzo is our player. He has not been fired. As things stand, he is our player,” said Highlanders’ marketing and media officer Nozibelo Maphosa. <img class="wp-image-606007 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders Ngodzo was not in the side that faced Manica Diamonds on Sunday where 16-year-old Prince Ndlovu made his debut for Bosso in a central midfield position where Ngodzo plays. The club has already parted ways with Keith Mavhunga, who failed to make an impact during his stay. Although the coaches have ruled out any incoming players, it seems likely that players from their junior structures will replace those that depart, as the club seeks to revive its culture of promoting players from the development setup. <img class="wp-image-626047 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Prince-Ndlovu-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Prince-Ndlovu-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Prince-Ndlovu--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prince Ndlovu Ngodzo has made a few cameo roles for the club since his return to his boyhood club in April last year. It has been a struggle for the midfielder to replicate the form that won him the Soccer Star of the Year accolade in 2019. — @innocentskizoe
