The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE start their campaign in the International Cricket Council Twenty20 World Cup Qualifier B when they play against Singapore at Queens Sports Club this morning. <img class="wp-image-609481 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Queens-Sports-Club.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Queens-Sports-Club.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Queens-Sports-Club-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Queens Sports Club  The host nation will be looking to get off the blocks early in the tournament in one of the two matches scheduled for Queens Sports Club, with the afternoon fixture featuring Netherlands and Papua New Guinea. Across the city at Bulawayo Athletic Club, Jersey and the United States of America, who are in the same group as Zimbabwe, square off in the morning followed by the Hong Kong clash with Uganda in the afternoon. <img class="wp-image-626410 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-156.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-156.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-156-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dave Houghton Zimbabwe under new coach Dave Houghton, are oozing with confidence but they should, however, be reminded that the last time they played at Queens, they were second best against Namibia and lost the fifth T20 International by 32 runs despite the bowlers having done a wonderful job of restricting the Namibians to 127/7 in 20 overs. By winning that match, Namibia made history and took the five-match contest 3-2 to record their first ever T20I series victory over an ICC Full Member country. Sean Williams is back which is a massive boost for Zimbabwe’s batting, which was found wanting against Namibia as well as in the white ball matches against Afghanistan.  Williams, a left-handed batsman who also bowls left-arm spin, will be key for Zimbabwe in this tournament as he is very much familiar with Queens Sports Club. Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine has been struggling with the bat of late but is capable of producing magnificent performance. Innocent Kaia, Regis Chakabva, Ryan Burl, Sikandar Raza and Wessley Madhevere will also be key to Zimbabwe’s batting. <img class="wp-image-480780 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Mr-Tavengwa-Mukuhlani11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Mr-Tavengwa-Mukuhlani11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Mr-Tavengwa-Mukuhlani11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Tavengwa Mukuhlani Madhevere, a former Zimbabwe Under-19 vice-captain, was singled out by Zimbabwe Cricket chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani as a perfect example of a player who came from the dusty streets of Chitungwiza to represent his country in international cricket. “We also have our own Wessley Madhevere. Wessley represents what cricket is all about; a journey from the dusty streets of Chitungwiza or as we proudly call them, the ghettos, to stand today representing aspirations of a whole nation,” Mukuhlani said, Blessing Muzarabani, the towering fast bowler leads the Zimbabwe bowling attack with fellow seamers Tendai Chatara, Luke Jongwe, Richard Ngarava and left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza. <img class="wp-image-626308 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-148.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-148.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-148-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Kirsty Coventry Speaking at the official opening ceremony of the tournament at Queens Sports Club yesterday, Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kirsty Coventry said her ministry will continue to back all sports associations in the country so that they not only host international sporting events, but also win them. “My ministry will continue to support all of our sporting federations to ensure that we continue to climb this international stage and are able to not only host more international events, but win them. We welcome home our head coach Dave Houghton and we know that the team is in good hands. Good luck to our Chevrons, we believe in you, we stand behind you all the way, you are not only inspiring, but uniting our country,” Minister Coventry said. Houghton has promised that there will be a lot of positivity in the way his team will approach their game and play without fear. Zimbabwean fans will be eager to see Houghton’s influence when they meet Singapore this morning. The two countries have only met twice in T20Is, at the Singapore Twenty20 Tri-Series in 2019, with each team winning once. Singapore won the first encounter by four runs before Zimbabwe came back strongly to win the second match by eight wickets. Entry for the group stages is free, which should be a motivating factor for fans to attend in their numbers. Spectators will only be required to pay for the two semi-finals and the final to be played at Queens Sports Club on Sunday.
