The Chronicle   Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CHICKEN INN coach Joey Antipas and striker Brian Muza have bagged their second individual accolades of the 2021/22 Castle Lager Premiership season after being voted Coach of the Month and Player of the Month for June. These are their second accolades following a haul in February. The PSL announced on Tuesday morning that the duo was voted the best for June, giving Antipas and Muza something to smile about following Saturday’s 3-0 home drubbing by champions FC Platinum. In June, teams played two games, with Chicken Inn winning both against Triangle United (1-0) at Gibbo Stadium and a 4-1 demolition of Cranborne Bullets 4-1 in Mutare. Muza has scored 10 goals and has been a consistent performer for Chicken Inn and his performances are why they are challenging for the championship. – @ZililoR
