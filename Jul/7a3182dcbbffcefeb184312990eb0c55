The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter GOVERNMENT yesterday said there is room for dialogue and believes it will reach an understanding with civil servants after they stated that they will go on a two-day strike. Civil servants, through their unions, yesterday reportedly gave notice to Government that they will undertake a two-day strike. Government this month effected a 100 percent salary for its workers, despite the employees arguing that it fell short. Civil servants receive a hybrid salary consisting of foreign currency and local currency.  Since March this year civil servants have been receiving US$175 while the difference is paid in local currency. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima said he had not received the strike notice but added that Government is committed to addressing their concerns. “I have not received it [the notification letter] but the fact of the matter is that there is a window for engagement. We have been in engagement with their leadership in trying to reach common ground and we will continue with the engagements. So, we encourage them to continue reporting for work as negotiations are ongoing. I hope we will have reached an agreement before they go on strike,” said Prof Mavima. <img class="size-full wp-image-593053" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Minister-Professor-Paul-Mavima.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Minister-Professor-Paul-Mavima.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Minister-Professor-Paul-Mavima-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Professor Paul Mavima In a letter dated 25 July, civil servants’ union leaders reported that they held a meeting last Friday where they resolved to go on strike tomorrow and Thursday. “That civil servants in the health, education and the rest of civil service will proceed to a national two-day strike on Wednesday 27 July 2022 and Thursday 28 July 2022.
