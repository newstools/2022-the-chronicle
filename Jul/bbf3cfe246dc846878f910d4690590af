Council’s chief executive officer Mr Farai Machaya confirmed the development.

He said council will rehabilitate Crossroads to Gweru Road once it receives more funds. Turning to devolution funds, Mr Machaya said the council is expecting to commission Bhalimasvesve Primary School F14 staff house, Zhombe flea market and Columbina public toilet. “We expect to commission Sherwood Clinic next month, Langton Clinic in September, Hunters Secondary School in October and Fafi Clinic block in November,” said Mr Machaya. Meanwhile, the City of Gweru has purchased a tipper truck worth US$102 660 using devolution funds.  City of Gweru management, led by acting town clerk Mr Vakai Douglas Chikwekwe and audit committee chairperson Councillor Albert Chirau, took delivery of the truck at town house recently. Council spokesperson Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee said the tipper truck, the first for the local authority, is expected to go a long way in improving service delivery. “We realised that we could not operate without a tipper truck particularly in the roads section which needs improvement. We have been having challenges because we did not have a tipper truck to carry gravel,” she said. Ms Chingwaramusee said council has been hiring tipper trucks. “We intend to buy more tipper trucks to beef up our fleet,” she said. The truck comes a few months after the local authority commissioned a truck and a dumper purchased using devolution funds.
