POLICE in Bulawayo have bemoaned an upsurge in cases of baby dumping, infanticide and termination of pregnancy. They called on residents to desist from such acts as they violate children’s rights. <img class="wp-image-628987 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-174.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-174.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-174-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Child rights This follows an incident where a woman found a newly born baby dumped on a mountain while conducting prayers last Thursday. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said of late the reports were increasing which is a cause for concern. “A 30-year-old woman from Bulawayo had ascended a mountain to conduct prayers when she bumped into a baby wrapped in a towel. She assumed the mother of the baby was nearby and went on with her prayers but no one came for the baby. This prompted her to report the matter to the police as she realised the baby could have been dumped on the mountain,” said Insp Ncube. “In a separate incident in Matsheumhlope, on Friday at around 5.30PM a dog brought home what appeared to be a human foetus. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628999 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-175.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-175.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-175-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The owner of the dog, a 34-year-old man, discovered that it was a half body of a human foetus; from the stomach to the legs. Both legs were there but the left foot was missing and he immediately made a report to the police.” Insp Ncube called on women to use contraceptives to avoid falling pregnant. “The upsurge of cases of baby dumping, birth concealment, termination of pregnancy and other cases involving newly born babies, is very disturbing. As police we urge women to avoid unwanted pregnancies,” he said. Insp Ncube said in the event one finds herself in trouble as a result of pregnancy or child birth, she must seek assistance or advice from fellow family members, church or community leaders or the police victim friendly unit. – @thamamoe
