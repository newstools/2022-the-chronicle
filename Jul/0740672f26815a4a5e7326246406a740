SPOKEN word artiste Andrew Manyika is set to embark on a nationwide tour which will see him perform in four cities. Manyika, a world-class comedian, poet and sought-after master of ceremonies is on a mission to create and capture moments and memories. Dubbed Colo(g)niser, the tour is set to kick off at Kwekwe Theatre next Saturday before it heads to Hope Centre in Bulawayo on July 30. Mutare will play host to the artist on August 20 at Courtaid Theatre before he wraps up the tour with a live recording in the capital city at Reps Theatre. Through his manager and wife Tinovimba Manyika, the artiste said he is geared up for the tour that will see him share the stage with fellow comedian, Bulawayo-based MaForty.  “The Colo(g)niser is a unique live show that combines poetry, comedy and music to create a one of a kind experience fit for the whole family. It’s an hour that’s part comedy, part poetry, and fun times. People in the cities that we’ll visit should be prepared to laugh a lot and think a little as The Colo(g)niser will take them on a ride through the funny side of life. “It’s got a lot more than the title suggests,” Manyika said. “In Bulawayo, he’ll be supported by renowned comedian MaForty and the stage is going to be designed by Fun and Fab Functions who do stellar work with events. So it’s really something to look forward to,” she said. Manyika said the tour has been necessitated by the need for their brand to grow nationally. <img class="size-full wp-image-594240" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-7-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-7-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-7-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> MaForty “I’ve put on several one-man shows – Love and Laughter (2016), Home Coming (2016); Just Married (2019) and The Drew Mann Show (2019) and I got to a point where I wanted to challenge myself to take things to the next level. “When I made that decision, an amazing opportunity opened up in the form of Scripts and Bars, a collaboration between the Swiss Agency for Development AMA Cooperation, the British Council and UK-based Reprezent whose support made this tour possible,” he said. Turning to her husband’s career, Manyika said he was educated in Kwekwe, Mutare and Johannesburg. He was inspired by Chris Rock among other comedians. “Watching Chris Rock’s special ‘Kill The Messenger’ in 2008 was the moment that he got the idea that he could do this. His career began in Mzansi in 2011 when Trevor Noah’s star was still on the rise, so he was also a definite inspiration. “Aside from travelling to America and Egypt to perform at some of their international poetry festivals, one of his biggest highlights was performing at the Permican Awards at the Harare City Sports Centre in 2019. That was the first time a spoken word artiste performed to a sold out City Sports Centre.” <img class="wp-image-627895 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chris-Rock-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chris-Rock-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chris-Rock-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Chris Rock She said his biggest challenge has been learning to appeal to audiences. “The thing about showbiz is that when it’s showtime it’s showtime! That’s the contract you as the entertainer have with your audience, so the most interesting challenge was learning how to be fully present on stage so as to give the people the experience that they would have come for. “He’s managed to grasp things and uses four phrases to describe his comedy style – family friendly, clean, smart and of course funny.” Manyika holds accolades that include Champion of the Drama For Life Poetry Slam in South Africa that set him on a path where he has been recognised by the National Arts Merit Awards with an Outstanding Comedian nomination. “He’s also won several regional and international poetry competitions.” – @mthabisi_mthire
