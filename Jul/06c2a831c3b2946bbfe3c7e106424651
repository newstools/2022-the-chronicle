The regulatory authority said this calls for policy and strategic intervention at both the operator and fiscal levels. “On their part, operators need to innovate and explore sustainable revenue generation and cost containment avenues considering the current economic climate. “On the other hand, monetary authorities need to consider the prioritisation of the sector in terms of foreign currency given the capital-intensive nature of the industry.” In the period under review, Potraz said total postal and courier volumes declined by 13.4 percent to record 556,618 items from 642,432 items recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. <img class="wp-image-518779 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/TelOne-telephone-lines.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/TelOne-telephone-lines.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/TelOne-telephone-lines-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  telephone lines International incoming courier was the only category to register growth in volumes.
