The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau WORK on the construction of a new plant and animal quarantine, which is set to decongest the Beitbridge Border Post and enhance the country’s capacity to control exports and imports of related products is nearing completion. The facility is located about 5km north of the Beitbridge Border Post. It is one of the key projects that the government in partnership with the Zimborders Consortium is constructing under the US$300 million Beitbridge modernisation initiative. Prior to the latest development, related services were being offered within the border area albeit under limited space. <img class="wp-image-632797 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Water reservoir- Image taken from Shutterstock The border modernisation project is being done in a 17 and half years concession, which will see the consortium managing the facility for that period and retaining its investments from toll fees. Afterwards, the facility will be handed over to the Government. Some off-port-works include the construction of 220 staff houses, a fire station, a 14, 5 mega litres water reservoir, sewer oxidation dam and road upgrade. These are at various stages of construction. Zimborders Technical Coordinator, Engineer Stephen Rupiya said, “this project is being carried out concurrently with the in-port works. Within this facility, we have various laboratories with a special focus on animal health, general hazards, and farming-related equipment that will be examined for conformity with imports and exports regulations.”  He said the main structures were completed and they were putting final touches. “Some of the laboratories will be managed by the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), Veterinary Services, Agriculture Plant, and the National Biotech Laboratory. This will help decongest the border since this department will be based here full time to attend to issues as and when they arise.” Eng Rupiya said they were on course to complete the port works by the end of April next year. He said the fire station, sewer oxidation dam and water reservoir had been completed while remarkable progress had been made on the housing section. Beitbridge’s Health and Plant Inspector-in-charge, Mr Levy Gama said the new facility will improve efficiency considering that all laboratory analysis will be done on the spot. <img class="wp-image-632800 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> animal health- Image taken from Shutterstock He said previously they would send samples to other urban areas, especially in Harare which was time-consuming. “This is a welcome development which will enhance the ease of doing business,” said Mr Gama. “The facility has labs and incinerators for us to do the laboratory analysis and to destroy rejected products. In addition, this is good for citrus and horticulture farmers since we will be able to do all the necessary checks for exports and imported raw material closer to them”. A customs clearing agent, Mr Itayi Misihayirabwi said the availability of an animal and plant quarantine one-stop shop was a relief. <img class="wp-image-632809 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-43-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-43-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-43-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> laboratory analysis He said the move will help resolve most queries that have been arising between importers/exporters and authorities on standing rules and regulations. Mr Misihayirabwi said in some instances animals and perishable commodities could spend a long time within the border pending various laboratory checks done elsewhere. “In this case, every query will be solved on the dot and this will then improve the turnaround time on cargo clearance. This may be locally or regionally destined cargo,” he said. Ms Evelyn Jegede said the new facility will cut costs for many transporters who convey animal and agriculture-related products. She said previously these would spend more time within the border or Beitbridge awaiting lab results on their products requiring imports or export permits and inspections. The development, she said, had brought critical services that affect regional and international trade closer to the people. – @tupeyo.
