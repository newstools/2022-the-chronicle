Mr Melody performed some of the songs at his birthday party at the new Royal African Dining and the song Kiss sent attendees, both young and old, into a frenzy. The party was attended by about 100 people comprising mostly Mr Melody’s family, close friends and fans. The party ignited life into the quiet city as  people danced until midnight. The occasion exposed the great desire for night life in Victoria Falls as some uninvited people gatecrashed the event. Singers from Danica Studios entertained guests. It was a romantic affair as attendees were dressed to the nines with Mr Melody’s girlfriend – Leslie Ndlovu posing for photos with the birthday boy on the red carpet. After the presentation of gifts and presents, it was time for Mr Melody to present his EP. If the feedback from attendees is anything to go by, then the producer is onto something. <img class="wp-image-629401 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Audio Mack Mr Melody said the EP is now available on Audio Mack, Sound Cloud and Spotify. “We’re working on videos for the album.
