THE delivery of 220 000 housing units by 2025 is not the Government’s sole responsibility but a collective stakeholder approach aimed at reducing the estimated 1,5 million housing backlog, a Cabinet minister has said. The housing delivery pillar within the National Development Strategy 1 is expected to deliver 220 000 housing units by 2025.
The trajectory towards the attainment of Vision 2030 revolves around providing human settlements, which meet the aspirations of the Zimbabwean people, while addressing affordability and modernisation aspects. Speaking to the Chronicle in Bulawayo yesterday during a tour of Hopelyn Housing Estate near Mahatshula suburb, Housing and Social Amenities Minister, Daniel Garwe, said concerted efforts are being made to reduce the national housing backlog which he described as a moving target. <img class="size-full wp-image-628165" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Minister.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Minister.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Minister-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hopelyn Estate project manager Mr Alastair Coulson shows Minister of National Housing and Social Amenities Daniel Garwe maps of stands during a tour of Hopelyn stands in Bulawayo yesterday. “The national housing backlog is a moving target. At the beginning of the year, 1. 5 million housing units were required but the demand is always increasing. “We are doing everything possible to ensure that we reduce the backlog and we have a target of 220 000 housing units to be constructed by 2025,” said minister Garwe. He explained the key players involved in the delivery of 220 000 housing units. “The 220 000 units is a conglomerate figure, the houses are being constructed by the Government, local authorities, private developers, financial institutions and pension funds. “When people hear of 220 000 housing units, they think it’s the central government building on its own but it’s a collective approach. All players in the construction sector are working together to ensure that we meet the target,” said Minister Garwe. <img class="size-full wp-image-619480" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Housing and Social Amenities Minister, Daniel Garwe The public-private-partnerships (PPPs) are perceived as one of the ways of fulfilling the 220 000 housing units target and go a long way towards easing the burden on the Government in terms of clearing the national housing backlog. During the tour, minister Garwe expressed satisfaction with the implementation of the three-phased Hopelyn housing project.
He said the private developers are implementing the Government’s recommendations of first laying out vital infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer reticulation facilities before construction. “The development speaks directly into the dictates of the National Human Settlement Policy which indicates that we should now stop building houses before on-site infrastructure is done. That reduces pressure in processing title deeds,” he said.
He was shown the project layout that would have all key social amenities. Hopelyn Estate Project Manager Alastair Coulson said the uptake of stands was at 95 percent. “We have 120 houses that are in the process of being built and 30 residents have moved in. We are pleased with the uptake. We have encouraged those who have bought stands to follow certain minimum standards of building so that we have a uniformity of structures,” said Mr Coulson.  Mr Coulson said the housing project is part of efforts to reduce the national housing backlog. “We are certainly contributing to the reduction of the national housing backlog. With all three projects in the next ten years, we would have provided about 5 000 housing units,” he said. The project comes at a time when the city is battling to reduce the housing waiting list and such private sector input goes a long way in reducing the demand for shelter. More than 125 000 residents are on the Bulawayo housing waiting list. — @nqobilebhebhe
