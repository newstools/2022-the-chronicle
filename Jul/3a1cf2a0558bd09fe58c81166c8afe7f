The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City coach Farai Tawachera says the club’s management is trying to acquire the signature of out of favour Highlanders’ midfielder Joel Ngodzo and two other players before the transfer window closes in two weeks’ time. Tawachera hinted that a lot was happening behind the scenes to acquire Ngodzo to bolster his squad to fight relegation. <img class="wp-image-607530 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Farai Tawachera “The management is handling that issue. Mine is to wait for the guy to pitch up at training and we go. We are looking to sign three players, but in my view, the process is getting slow. We need players like now and l am hopeful we will get the players we want. Our big brothers are promising to assist us and we are hopeful. There is a need to speed up the process,” said Tawachera.  Although Highlanders dismissed reports that Ngodzo will be released, sources have said the attacking midfielder is on his way out and besides City, struggling Caps United are also in the running to snap up their former player, who won the Soccer Star of the Year accolade while turning out for the Green Machine in 2019. If Ngodzo leaves, he would be the second player to be released by Bosso after Keith Mavhunga, who was offloaded last week. Ngodzo joined Caps United from Highlanders in 2015 after he dumped Bosso to join FC Platinum, only to rejoin Bosso, but he has failed to make an impact. He has only made a few cameo roles for Bosso since his returning to his boyhood club in April last year. — @innocentskizoe
