POLICE have raised concern over an upsurge in the number of suspects who have died in cases of ‘‘mob justice’’ across the country. In a statement, national police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi warned members of the public against taking the law into their hands. “The ZRP (Zimbabwe Republic Police) is concerned with murder cases which are continuously occurring in various parts of the country. The ZRP encourages people who would have apprehended suspects for various criminal acts to surrender them to police for the law to take its course through the courts,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said police will not hesitate to arrest people who would be involved in beating suspects to death. <img class="size-full wp-image-602061" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi This follows an increase in the number of suspects who have died at the hands of the mobs in recent months. In one case, according to police, which occurred on 10 July, a mob assaulted Tinashe Mangwende (41) to death for allegedly breaking into a house in Ruwa and stealing a television set. “Police have since arrested Samuel Masiyandima (24) and Ishmael Magunje who were part of the mob which assaulted Mangwende to death in Ruwa,” said police. In another case, Tapiwa Moyo (40), succumbed to injuries he sustained during an attack by a mob in Norton on 10 July for allegedly breaking into houses and stealing cash and other valuables.  “The mob accused Moyo of breaking into Enara Chikata’s house in Katanga where he stole two cellphones. The police have so far arrested Enara Chikata, Prince Layi and Last Chivero in connection with the case,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. Meanwhile, William Hwede was found dead on 11 July near a wholesale shop in Karoi town after he was allegedly assaulted by unknown suspects on allegations that he stole unidentified property at Karoi Hospital. Police recovered a stick and a pair of catapult suspected to have been used in the assault of the victim at the scene.
This also comes at a time when cases of housebreaking and robbery are on the increase.
