GOVERNMENT will contribute US$175 million towards partial compensation of insurance policy holders and pension scheme members for losses they suffered during the period leading to 2009, when the country switched to the multi-currency system. Cabinet has considered and approved the move, which is part of the Compensation Framework for 2009 Insurance Policy Holders and Pension Scheme Members and Supplementary Compensation. Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, made presentation over the issue during Tuesday Cabinet meeting. The compensation process seeks to address historic concerns emanating from the period when Zimbabwe adopted the multi-currency regime in 2009, which sparked public outcry over loss of value by insurance policy holders and pension fund members. <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay Public complaints pointed to lack of transparency in the manner in which their long-term contracts were converted from the ZW$ to US$ in 2009. In response to this, the Government commissioned the Justice Smith Commission of Inquiry in 2015, which culminated in a detailed report that was submitted in 2017 and adopted by Cabinet in 2018. In September 2018, Government then mandated the Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) to implement the recommendations of the Justice Smith Inquiry. “Cabinet wishes to highlight that significant progress has been registered in implementing the recommendations,” Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said in a post-Cabinet media briefing.  “In recognising the prejudice suffered by pensioners and policy holders, Cabinet has approved that Government contributes US$175 million towards the pre-2009 compensation to partly cover for the loss of value suffered. This will also bring closure to this long outstanding matter. “Cabinet further highlights that draft regulations to bring legal force to the compensation framework are now in place. The regulations will be issued in terms of the Insurance Act and the Pensions and Provident Funds Act.” Among other key recommendations, the minister said legislation governing insurance and private occupational pensions funds has been reviewed. “The Bills to amend the Insurance and Pensions Commission Act, the Pension and Provident Funds Act and Insurance Act are at different stages of consideration in Parliament,” she said. <img class="wp-image-627118 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/monica.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/monica.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/monica-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa “The amendment Bills will address all strategic deficiencies in the legal framework as identified by the Commission of Inquiry.” The regulatory and supervisory capacity of IPEC has also been enhanced through increasing the staff complement and diversifying its skills base. This also includes enhancing oversight roles of corporate governance, risk management and investment management in pension funds and insurance companies. Sector-specific guidance was also provided to the insurance and pensions industry following the 2019 currency reforms in order to ensure seamless transition of long-term contracts denominated in foreign currency to ZW$ without prejudice to policyholders and pension scheme members. “The Compensation Framework outlines the processes required to achieve an objective and transparent compensation exercise,” said Sen Mutsvangwa. <img class="wp-image-627571 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-39-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-39-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-39-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> multi-currency “This ensures that prejudiced members of insurance policies and pension funds get reasonable benefits, while simultaneously maintaining stability and confidence in the industry.” The minister said targeted beneficiaries of the compensation are policyholders of life savings products and pensioners whose benefits were due or paid during the years 2000 to 2010. This is the period during which the macro-economic fundamentals had the most adverse impact on long-term savings contracts. “The period 2009 to 2010 is meant to deal with conversions that took place in response to currency reforms,” she said.
