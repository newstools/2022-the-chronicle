FARMERS in Zvishavane District, Midlands province have started preparations for the 2022-2023 summer cropping season.
With most of Sub-Saharan Africa reeling from the adverse effects of climate change induced droughts, farmers in Zvishavane are working on the pretext that a stitch in time saves nine with preparations for the summer cropping season already underway. Mr Tafara Moyo from Muzondiwa Village in Zvishavane said they have started digging holes in line with Pfumvudza/ Intwasa concept. <img class="wp-image-620440 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-372.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-372.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-372-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Agritex “We have already started preparing our fields with assistance from our Agritex officers. We want to surpass last season’s exploits since Government has promised to give us inputs for five plots instead of the previous three plots. “This is the time for us to commence the liming process, and we are using stalks for the process. We want to reach the province’s hectares under maize target,” he said. Acting Midlands Provincial Director, Agriculture and Rural Development Services Mrs Madeline Magwenzi said while some farmers in Zvishavane District have started preparations, some across the province were still to commence.  She encouraged farmers to start preparations now as they take advantage of the moisture content in the soil. “We have farmers in Zvishavane District in the Midlands province who have started preparations for the 2022-2023 summer cropping season and that’s commendable. We advise farmers without irrigation to start working on their plots or land,” said Mrs Magwenzi. <img class="wp-image-625366 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-94.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-94.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-94-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pfumvudza/Intwasa She said Government is going to assist villagers with inputs under the Pfumvudza/ Intwasa programme. “This upcoming cropping season we are increasing farmer support as we are giving farming inputs for five plots up from three plots,” said Mrs Magwenzi. “Government through the Agritex officers is also training farmers on productive farming. We have been having trainers training workshops including all Agritex officers from across the province who will cascade down the knowledge to farmers across the districts.” Mrs Magwenzi said many farmers who had not taken the Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme last summer were impressed and inspired by high yields realised by others to join the programme. She said Midlands province is targeting to put 410 000 hectares under maize this 2022/2023 summer cropping season, up from 393 000 hectares planted this season to meet food security for the province.
