Through Lusste Marketing which we ran together, we hosted several big shows, something that I’m striving to continue doing. “One of our biggest shows was between 2011 and 2012 where we brought Sulumani Chimbetu and Oliver Mtukudzi to Bulawayo in what turned out to be a memorable night in the city’s arts scene,” said Rice. “This month, we mark one year since we lost a figure who changed the tourism face of the city. To ensure that we keep her legacy alive, we want to celebrate her by hosting this commemoration gig. We hope to host the event in mid-July at a venue to be announced,” he said. He urged people to attend the commemorations in their numbers adding that they will be roping in a lot of local talent. “We’re going to rope in many local artistes as we want to give them a platform to shine.” – @mthabisi_mthire
