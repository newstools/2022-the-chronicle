Unimills-Hokoyo team principal Davis Muhambi was thrilled by his cyclists’ performances, given that it was their first attempt in duathlon. He said the ride had been experimental, as the club looks to spread its wings as a sporting club and take part in other events. “We are very happy that Nkust (Nkulumo) and Thulani did well in an event they have never competed in before. We have always been saying that our vision is to empower the youth and to do this we decided to use sport to achieve this goal. “Duathlon is a sport that we are exploring and we may just continue to take part in events such as the national championships,” said Muhambi. — @RealSimbaJemwa
