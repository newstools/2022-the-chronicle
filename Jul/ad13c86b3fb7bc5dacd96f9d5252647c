The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FACING the big guns tends to psych up players from the so called small teams and it will be no exception when supercharged Bulawayo Chiefs players face Harare giants Dynamos on Sunday at the National Sports Stadium. Having lost the first leg 2-0 in a match in which Chiefs failed to convert a penalty, Chiefs captain Marlvin Mkolo, who has been a vital cog at defence, predicts a tough encounter. It is a match that the Chiefs skipper believes they have to collect maximum points to move up the ladder. Chiefs are on position 10 with 29 points after 22 games and can move three places up the ladder if they beat Dynamos, in the event that Ngezi Platinum Stars (30), Black Rhinos (31) and Herentals (32) lose their respective matches. <img class="wp-image-604749 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marlvin Mkolo Ngezi and Black Rhinos, who fired their head coaches during the week, take on Triangle United and Cranborne Bullets respectively while Herentals visit unpredictable Bulawayo City. Mkolo said following their last weekend’s 2-0 away win at Tenax CS FC where they got their goals from striker Obriel Chirinda and attacking midfielder Aurthur Musiyiwa, morale in camp is high. “Dynamos are a big side and players are always keen on playing in such big matches and our team is no different. This is one of the big fixtures in terms of history that Dynamos has and we are not putting ourselves under unnecessary pressure but are focused on fighting for three points.  “It’s a self-motivating fixture, everyone is working hard to be available for selection and I’m sure we’re giving the coaches a positive headache because of the energy that the guys are giving at training. We understand the importance of getting maximum points so that we move  up the ladder,” Mkolo said. The defender seems to have established a formidable partnership with veteran Ben Nyahunzwi at central defence in the absence of Kevin Moyo. It is unlikely that Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso will temper with the backline of Mkolo, Nyahunzwi, Tarisai Chikwende and Felix Moyo when they face DeMbare. Chiefs’ rising star Mthokozisi Msebe who missed his team’s 2-0 win at Tenax as he was serving a suspension having accumulated three yellow cards, is hoping to bounce back. <img class="wp-image-623527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-45-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nilton Terroso Msebe, who is having a remarkable Premiership debut season, having joined Chiefs from Zifa Bulawayo Division Two Soccer League side Bantu Leopards, is eager to play a role against Dynamos. “When a team wins, it’s difficult to just find your way back into the team and I’ve been working hard to try and make sure that I can be part of the squad on Sunday. I’m enjoying great form of late and I want to play in such games. <img class="wp-image-631570 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZIFA “As a team, we’re working hard to make sure that when we travel to Harare we bring a good result. I would be happy if I can play a part in getting the desired result,” said Msebe. Chirinda, who is not new to big matches having done so while at Chicken Inn and defunct Bantu Rovers, says they want to maintain consistency. “It’s a big game and all eyes will be on us but it’s just like any other match. What’s key for us is to try to be consistent and build from our win against Tenax,” Chirinda said. — @ZililoR
