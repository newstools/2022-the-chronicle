THIEVES in Gweru are now targeting water meters amid reports that residents from 24 houses made reports with the police.
Last week households in suburbs such as Ridgemont and Mkoba 14 extension woke up to find not a single drop coming out of the taps in their homes. As they went outside to investigate, they saw water streaming in their yards. Mr Mark Sibanda from Mkoba 14 extension said he woke up around 6AM to find that there was no water in his bathroom on Monday. “At first, I thought there was no running water because of the usual water shedding we are experiencing in Gweru,” he said.
“But then I heard the shouts of my neighbour telling me that someone had disconnected the water meters. Several houses in our area were affected,” he said.  Another resident said he heard a gurgling sound from the kitchen tap, went to the front window and saw water gushing out where the water meter used to be. The targeted water meters are made of copper and brass and it is believed they are stolen and sold to scrap merchants for the metal content. Some residents are alleging that coffin makers smelt them and make brass handles for their product. <img class="size-full wp-image-623653" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/water-meters-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/water-meters-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/water-meters-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Water meters “These thieves are becoming more opportunistic and are now even stealing water meters to make a quick buck. The police must interrogate coffin makers who are sprouting in Gweru and find out where they are getting the copper and brass handles,” said Mrs Angela Siziba from Ridgemont suburb, She said they are considering replacing the water meters with plastic ones. Mrs Siziba said the result is often water running to waste as the water will be gushing out from where the water meter used to be. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623650" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/water-meters.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/water-meters.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/water-meters-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> City of Gweru spokesperson Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee confirmed the negative development. “In an unusual new trend thieves in Gweru are now targeting water meters at households. We have received reports from about 24 residents who made a report with the police,” she said. Ms Chingwaramusee encouraged residents to report theft of water meters to the police and council immediately. “The theft of water meters’ matter is being handled by the police. Council is not aware why these are being stolen,” he said. “However, in a certain case we attended at the courts the culprit said he was smelting the meters made of brass which are then used to make coffin handles,” she said.
