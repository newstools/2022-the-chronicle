The Chronicle ARTISTES from Bulawayo are set to get a rare opportunity of collaborating with Amapiano hotshot, Nkosazana Daughter, 3D Events Management Managing Director Mduduzi Mdlongwa has said. Nkosazana Daughter (real name Nkosazana Nolwazi Kimberly Nzama) is set to meet with local artistes during her maiden tour of Zimbabwe where she will perform at BAC Leisure on August 8 in the city. <img class="wp-image-617173 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/kabza.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/kabza.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/kabza-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kabza De Small The voice behind hits such as Dali Nguwe and Sofa Silahlane will jet into the country on the very day that she will be performing. The show, in honour of Mdue’s cousin Bethson Mdlongwa, will see Nkosazana Daughter interacting with a selected few artistes. “We are expecting Nkosazana Daughter on the 8th of August afternoon for my cousin’s birthday celebrations. “We thought of bringing the most trending female artiste and she was an obvious choice as her music has a huge following this side, “ said Mdu. <img class="wp-image-523703 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Master-KG.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Master-KG.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Master-KG-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Master KG Most of the times, international artistes only perform and leave without even getting to interact with local acts, a feat that Mdlongwa said is set to change. “Nkosazana Daughter’s show will be like no other. Besides her touring the city, she will also get to meet local acts for a possible feature. <img class="wp-image-606712 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Maphorisa “This is a rare opportunity that may be the kick that may catapult one of our artistes into stardom. She is targeting female artistes and details on who she will be engaging with will be availed in due course, “ said Mdlongwa. He also revealed that only those with advanced tickets will be granted access to BAC Leisure for the show as there are no ticket sales at the gate. “I advise revellers to buy their tickets on time as the space is limited and we are going to only accommodate those who have advance tickets, “ he said.  The 21-year-old Amapiano singer has so far collaborated with Master KG, Tyler ICU, Kabza De Small, DJ Maphorisa and Soa Mattrix. In March, she travelled to Mozambique and will now add Zimbabwe to her list of destinations she has performed in. – @eMKlass_49
