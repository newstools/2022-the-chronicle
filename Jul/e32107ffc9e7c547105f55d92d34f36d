THE Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec) has set the exchange rate to be used for payment of examination fees for Grade 7, Ordinary and Advanced Level candidates. <img class="wp-image-613983 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-47-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimsec The fees, which are subsidised by Government, are pegged in US$ with parents or guardians forking out US$10 per subject for Grade 7 while the fees for O- and A-level candidate will be US$11 and US$22 per subject respectively. The registration window for the examinations opened yesterday and will close on July 29. “The exchange rate to be applied is at $454,7758 to US$1.  Payments must be made into the ZWL accounts which Zimsec communicated to the centres,” Zimsec said in a circular. “United States dollar and rand payments will be accepted via direct deposits through centres into the accounts which Zimsec communicated to the centres. <img class="wp-image-612018 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-68-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-68-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-68-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> foreign currency Zimsec continues to accept examination fees in the currency paid by the parent or guardian to the centres. Centres must therefore transmit examination fees in the currency which the parents or guardians pay the fees.” The Government is subsidising examination fees for learners in public schools, local authority schools and non-for-profit mission schools by 55 percent. Primary and Secondary Education Minister Dr Evelyn Ndlovu recently told Parliament that plans were in place to ensure that every prospective candidate registered for their exams. She said it was illegal for schools to insist on payment of fees arrears before registration for public examinations which may result in some candidates missing the examination deadline. “This is illegal and a violation of the right to education for all school going citizens,” she said.
