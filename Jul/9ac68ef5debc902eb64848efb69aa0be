The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo, Mat’land South Bureau Chief An information deficit on disability in rural communities is breeding various forms of abuse of people with disabilities (PWDs). According to research, PWDs, who comprise 15 percent of the world’s population are more likely to be poor, as they face catastrophic health expenditures and have lower levels of education that can allow them access to economic participation. Children with disabilities in most cases cannot access education due to long distances travelled to school. Experts say these children are often left behind in rural development interventions and in some cases are seen as objects of charity, medical treatment and social protection instead of individuals who are capable of exercising their rights, making decisions based on their free and informed consent and being active members of society and the economy. <img class="wp-image-631453 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-12-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> medical treatment In some rural communities, children with disabilities are hidden from the public eye by family members who are ashamed of them or believe they are a form of curse. Nkomwa Foundation Trust director Mr Pick Nkomwa said PWDs in rural communities experience all forms of abuse from their counterparts. “This is because of the information deficit on disability in communities. Communities are unaware what disability is or the causes of disabilities. They don’t know how to parent children with disabilities either. This is also because of cultural practices and beliefs as well as misconceptions about disabilities.  “There is no notice given for one family to be aware that a new member will be introduced to the family with a disability. When one with a disability is introduced, families divide,” said Mr Nkomwa. In most cases, he said, PWDs grow up in the custody of grandparents or other guardians. “To a greater extent, grandparents are heroes of many people with disabilities. Society views PWDs as objects that can be used for anything. Some regard PWDs as asexual. Some believe PWDs can be used to appease their spirits. Communities don’t have adequate knowledge about disability. Some practices are done knowingly and others unknowingly,” said Mr Nkomwa. <img class="wp-image-631465 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-13-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> education He said there is a need to continuously engage parents, communities and their local leadership on disability issues. “The media fraternity should continuously educate the society and demystify issues surrounding disability. Communities need to depart from seeing the disability first before the person. They need to see a human being with rights that every person should enjoy,” said Mr Nkomwa. “I appeal to all organisations, public and private and individuals in the disability fraternity to work hard in bringing awareness about disability to communities. With collective efforts, a change in attitude can be witnessed.” <img class="wp-image-631480 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-14-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> charity Ward 13 Councillor Miclas Ndlovu said failure to include PWDs in community initiatives is a form of abuse. “If we’re to take a close look at what has been happening, we realise that we have been abusing PWDs mistakenly. We have a lot of PWDs in our community and we have been conducting meetings in their absence which shows that we were not considering them as human beings. We thought that PWDs are only abused when they are beaten or raped but we realise that we have been infringing their rights. Therefore, it is our wish that we continue to be educated on disability issues and share knowledge on how to care for PWDs,” said Clr Ndlovu. — @Yolisswa
