The Chronicle Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm
(Daniel 6:3) THE Bible says an excellent spirit was in Daniel. <img class="alignnone wp-image-628948 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-169.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-169.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-169-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> How would you like that to be said of you? Well, the same is true about you because the day you received the Holy Spirit into your life, the excellent Spirit came to live in you. This excellent Spirit is manifested in you when you choose to let Him have His way in your life and when you accept the Scriptures as His real and perfect will and live accordingly. You’ll suddenly discover that everyone will be esteemed in your eyes.  When you’re awakened to this truth, everything about you becomes top-class; your life becomes an expression of the perfections of Christ. Daniel excelled above the presidents and satraps because they didn’t have an excellent spirit; rather, they had a bitter and complaining spirit. They saw that the king was always favourable towards Daniel and it hurt them, so they conspired against him out of bitterness. When people who don’t have an excellent spirit see others being praised, promoted and commended, they get hurt. In Matthew 7:18, the Lord Jesus said, “A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit, nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration]” (AMPC). Notice how He described an excellent fruit; He said it’s worthy of admiration. That’s amazing! What’s your life like? Is it worthy of admiration? If everyone turned out like you, will you be happy? If people behaved towards you the way you behave towards others, would you like it? Let your life be a manifestation of the Spirit of excellence in you. Tower above envy, bitterness, anger and all the negativities of life, because you’re an excellent tree bearing excellent fruits: “Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off, takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit, to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit” (John 15:2 AMPC). <img class="wp-image-624844 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prayer PRAYER Dear Father, I thank you for the special ministry of the Holy Spirit in my life today; you’ve given mean excellent spirit that produces in me an excellent character. Therefore, bitterness, anger and envy have no place in my life. Christ’s nature of excellence is manifested in me, and evident in my walk, talk, and everything I do, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
