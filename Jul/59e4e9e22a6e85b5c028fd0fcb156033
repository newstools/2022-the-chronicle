The graduates of the National Youth programme will be given first priority by institutions of higher learning including Polytechnics, teachers colleges, nursing schools as well as employment by army and Govenment. “The nation is further informed that four of the country’s provinces have no training centres at the moment. Some of them have since availed land for the construction of these centres in their respective provinces while those with training centres have allocated more land for income generating projects,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.  She said allocated land will form the basis of the production units of the training centres. “A total of six National Youth Training Centres will be refurbished while a further 15 new training centres will be constructed during the five-year period.” — @mashnets
