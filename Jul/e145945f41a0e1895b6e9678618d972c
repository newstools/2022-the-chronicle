In an interview after the AGM, Mr Shoniwa said his team would continue with its efforts to restore Bulawayo to its industrial hub status. “I am sure our re-election means that the members trust us in what we have been doing as people who are passionate with the development and turnaround of industries in Bulawayo and the nation at large,” he said. “We are going to continue representing the industry and engaging the authorities to make sure that the issues that the industry are facing are addressed. That’s our key responsibility that we have to do,” said Mr Shoniwa. “Our role is to advocate on behalf of businesses and represent them in all the forums where their interest is.” <img class="wp-image-629371 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-211.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-211.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-211-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Mr Shoniwa said the industries are facing a lot of challenges but insisted that Bulawayo must reclaim its industrial hub status. “We tried to have Special Economic Zones but that did not really help, so we need to continue to engage to make sure that this is an attractive destination for businesses,” he said. “At the moment you find Mashonaland is leading in terms of attracting investment but we think we have a strategic advantage in that we are close to countries like Botswana, South Africa, Zambia and shorter way to get into DRC but there is still need for more development.”  Mr Shoniwa said they need to identify the strength of the region and make sure that they take advantage of that in penetrating other business area. Ms Nkomo said industry was the driving force of the economy hence it was heartening and fulfilling for her to be involved in the deliberations and decision-making that is targeted at promoting the growth of industry in Bulawayo and the Matabeleland Province. “Moreso as we collectively work towards continuously increasing capacity utilisation, industry revitalisation and injecting more into the economy, I am honoured to be working with a team of powerful thought leaders,” she said. @SikhulekelaniM1.
