GOVERMMENT is targeting to provide revolving loans to 1 000 people with disabilities (PWDs) countrywide. PWDs will access up to US$1 000 which will be provided in local currency at interbank rate while grants of US$3 000 equivalent will be allocated to groups of people living with disabilities. This is part of the broader strategy that has been adopted by the Department of Disability Affairs in the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare to promote, protect and ensure that they enjoy their rights. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima revealed this on Wednesday during the National Assembly Question and Answer session saying this will address problems associated with some PWDs begging on the streets. <img class="size-full wp-image-625528" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-110.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-110.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-110-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Professor Paul Mavima “The Department of Disability Affairs has procured over 300 assistive devices for PWDs which are equitably distributed throughout the 10 provinces in Zimbabwe. Additionally, the Department of Disability Affairs is targeting to provide over 1 000 PWDs with disability revolving loans and special grants,” said Prof Mavima. “Please note, individuals with disabilities will receive loans amounting to US$1 000 equivalent to the prevailing current Zimbabwean dollar rate and PWDs groups of 10 will receive special grants amounting to US$3 000 equivalent to the prevailing current Zimbabwean dollar rate.” He said it was worrying that minors were being used by PWD while they begged on the streets.  Prof Mavima said of concern is that most of the PWDs reside in urban areas and are living below the poverty datum line.
He said Government has since launched several social protection and social safety nets anchored on the National Disability Policy, National Development Strategy 1 among other legal instruments. Prof Mavima said Government is considering putting children used by PWDs for begging purposes in foster care. He said Government will further consider providing capacity building training workshops on positive parenting skills specifically targeting parents with disabilities who are begging on the streets being accompanied by minors.
