GROWING up in the dusty streets of sprawling Cowdray Park suburb in Bulawayo, fringe national team striker Obriel Chirinda never thought he would be one of the best strikers in local football as he was a goalkeeper in his developmental years. Football has been kind to the pint-sized forward who is a menace to opposition defenders and enjoys tormenting his opponents. One of his prized memories in football is being part of the locally-based Warriors squad that participated at the finals of the African Nations Championships (Chan) last year in Cameroon. <img class="wp-image-631045 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-19-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-19-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-19-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> African Nations Championships (Chan) And being able to attend a continental competition is something that Obina, as his friends call him, treasures. “Growing up, I never thought that one day football would take me to different countries, let alone to be part of the national team. It’s every player’s dream to represent your country, be it in junior national teams or senior level. I’m fortunate to have played in the national Under-23 team as well as in the Chan squad. “When I look back to where it all started, I really feel the grace of God. At some point I was a goalkeeper while playing for the juniors, but because of my height, my development coaches encouraged me to improve on my infield style. I was blessed with speed and skill, so it became easier for me to play as a striker and grow to be the player I am today,” said Chirinda. As a primary school pupil at Mahlathini in Cowdray Park, Chirinda played for a local team before moving to Highlanders’ Under-13s in 2007 where he linked up with present Bosso player-of-the-moment Godfrey Makaruse, Chicken Inn’s central defender Itai Mabhunu and Bulawayo City goalkeeper Wandile Ndlovu. Chirinda says when his family moved to Nguboyenja a year later, he joined EM Sport Academy where he trained under Field “Stokee” Mlambo from Under-15s up to Division Three. “I used to double as an infield player and goalkeeper at EM Sport Academy. I’ll play as an infield player in the Under-15s and then be the goalkeeper in the Under-17s. I enjoyed it, but as I grew older, I had to face the reality that I’m short and if I’m to take football as a career I had to concentrate on my infield talent,” Chirinda says. He says his football break came in 2015 when football legend Agent “Ajila” Sawu lured him to Zifa Southern Region Division One Soccer League club Ntabazinduna Prison where he played for just a season before being snapped up by Bantu Rovers. <img class="wp-image-597613 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/zifa-cc.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/zifa-cc.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/zifa-cc-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zifa Rovers were known for being a development side that produced and marketed players like Marvelous Nakamba, Kudakwashe Mahachi, Teenage Hadebe and Nqobizitha Masuku among others,  and Chirinda knew that joining them would open opportunities. Chirinda played a key role in winning Rovers the Southern Region Division One Soccer League title in 2016, as they were promoted into the topflight the following season. Four months into the Premiership season in 2017, Chirinda was on the move, going to Cape Umoya, a First Division side in South Africa. However, he lasted about five months before returning home to join Chicken Inn in 2018. “I picked up a knee injury at Cape Umoya and that meant being on the side-lines for some time which affected my career. I was young, about 20 years old, so coming home to revive my career was the best option,” he said. He spent four years at Chicken Inn before leaving for new challenges at Bulawayo Chiefs where he believes he is one of the cornerstones of an ambitious project. Chirinda joined Chiefs at the beginning of the year and has scored four goals. Chiefs are going through a bad spell, going for three consecutive defeats, something Chirinda believes will come to pass.  “I had stayed long at Chicken Inn and had to move. Highlanders made an offer and so did Bulawayo Chiefs, but after consulting my family, we agreed that it wasn’t the time to join Bosso and I chose Chiefs. “I think the Chiefs project is progressing well. Of course, there are challenges here and there, but we will pass this rough phase. Everyone believes that we just need one turn of luck and once we hit the right chord, it will be sweet,” Chirinda says. On the challenges that he has faced during his career, Chirinda said: “I’ll say playing without any financial reward like we did at Ntabazinduna was a challenge but coach Ajila always spoke about being patient and using the platform to make names for ourselves which kept us going. When I moved to Cape Umoya, I struggled with the language as everyone spoke Afrikaans which they were comfortable with and as a youngster, I think it affected me.” He wishes that Zimbabwe returns to international football so that as players they participate at regional, continental and international events to expose their talents. In his parting shot, Chirinda who runs a  video gaming shop in Nguboyenja encouraged up  and coming footballers to shun drug and  substance abuse. “When I set up the video gaming shop in Nguboyenja, I wanted to first of all use it to supplement my income and secondly to create an environment where youngsters can spend their time playing games instead of abusing drugs and other substances. I grew up ekasi and I’ve seen talented guys wasting away because of drugs and substance abuse. So, I think I’m doing my part in fighting the scourge of drugs and substance abuse through the gaming shop.” — @ZililoR
