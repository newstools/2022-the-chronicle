The Chronicle That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand (2 Thessalonians 2:2). The expression, “the Day of Christ”, in our opening verse is wrongly assumed by many to generally mean “the last days.” There’s a difference between the Rapture of the Church, the Second Coming of Christ, and the Day of Christ. The Day of Christ refers to the millennium that begins with judgment. This isn’t the Great White Throne judgment in Revelation 20:11 or the Judgment Seat of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:10. No! It’s the judgment of His enemies at His second coming, just before He sets up His millennial reign.  On that special day, the Lord Jesus will be revealed from Heaven; He’ll come to rule in this world. At His appearing, the world, being at the Armageddon, will immediately unite against Him and the saints with Him, but these enemies will be destroyed, and all who reject Him: “But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me” (Luke 19:27). 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 also says, “ . . . the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.” However, before that great day of Christ, the Bible says there’ll be an apostasy: many who professed to be Christians will fall away from the faith: “Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way, for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first. . .” (2 Thessalonians 2:3 AMPC). <img class="size-full wp-image-570964" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible What could bring about such a thing? It’s the cares of this world: the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust for its pleasures. That’s why the Bible says, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world . . .” (1 John 2:15). It’s important that as the coming of the Lord approaches, you live your life stronger and stronger in Him so that you don’t fall away. Don’t cling to the things of the world. Let your focus be on the Master and on that day when He shall be revealed from Heaven. We all will be gathered unto Him to be with Him always. What a day that will be! Confession: My life is guided by Christ’s love, His Word, and my expectation of His imminent return. I’m established in His righteousness, awake and alert in the spirit. Through me, many today are brought out of darkness into the glorious liberty of the sons of God as I minister the Gospel to them, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
