Zanu-PF candidates Cde Spencer Tshuma and CCC candidate Mr Costin Muguti were nominated after successfully filing their papers before the Nomination court closed at 4PM.  Nomination officer, Mrs Dorcas Mpofu, who is the Midlands Provincial Zimbabwe Election Commission officer announced that the by-election will be held in Gokwe- Kabuyuni on August 27. “There were two nominees for Gokwe-Kabuyuni constituency meaning that on August 27, there will be a by- election. Spencer Tshuma of Zanu-PF and Costin Muguti of CCC successfully filed their papers,” she said. <img class="wp-image-624268 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF Gokwe-Kabuyuni has traditionally been held by Zanu-PF and the ruling party is expected to retain the seat. Cde Tshuma said considering the huge turnout during the internal party primaries to find a candidate to stand for the party, he was confident that the huge turnout would be there come by- election day. “I am confident that we are going to win the seat because we are a people’s party. I am confident that the huge turnout experienced during the primary elections will give the constituency back to the party,” he said. Cde Tshuma said the party is involved in a lot of life changing projects such as borehole drilling and rehabilitation of roads.
Mr Muguti said he was also confident that his party would win the seat. “We are going to take this constituency from Zanu-PF. We are going to engage in a lot of road rehabilitation works and improve the livelihood of the people,” he said. Popularly known as “Bhudhi”, Chikomba died 20km away from his home along the Gokwe-Chitekete highway when he was coming from a Zanu-PF Provincial Co-ordinating Committee meeting in Gweru.
