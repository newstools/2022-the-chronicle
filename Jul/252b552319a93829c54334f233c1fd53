As Zimbabwe we are very grateful to ABU for affording us this grand opportunity to host such an important conference. This is the first of its kind and thumbs up to the Zimbabwe National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board (ZNBWCB) for spearheading this event. “The official opening is tomorrow morning (today) and will be done by Vice-President, General (Rtd) Dr Costantino Chiwenga and will also be graced by the Minister of Youth Sport, Arts and Recreation Dr Kirsty Coventry and her deputy Tino Machakaire,” he said. Commenting on the training workshop, Noone said WBC was proud about the expansion of boxing in Zimbabwe and Africa. “The whole purpose of this ring officials seminar was to educate people who are new to the sport of boxing and use the minds of eminent people like van de Wiele to educate them so that they can go back and spread the education throughout the whole ecosystem of boxing in Africa.” He said the training sessions were very impressive and engaging. <img class="wp-image-563145 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Min-Machakaire.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Min-Machakaire.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Min-Machakaire-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tinomuda Machakaire “We are very impressed with the level of engagement and enthusiasm which is valuable and very important. This evening we will spend time going through the examination papers because we are not just handing out certificates,” he added. Meanwhile, Monalisa’s coach Simon Sankulani said the boxer is aiming for a knockout.  “She has been preparing since the day she took the title because she knew the belt would be defended. She is a hungry lion and I can see even the change in her eyes. She knows what she is facing. Our game plan is to go for a knock out and we just hope the match comes earlier so that she doesn’t become impatient,” said Sankulani. — @ncubeleon
