THE African Swimming Confederation (CANA) Zone IV junior level championships will be held virtually in October.
The Zone IV countries taking part include Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The tournament, which will run from 23 to 29 October, will see results and times from the virtual swim meets recorded and then used to determine the winners. Speaking to Chronicle Sports, Bulawayo Amateur Swimming Association (BASA) chairperson Phawulani Ngwenya said this will be the first major competition this year and they have already started preparations.  “We have started winter training, land training and water training,” said Ngwenya. The age groups that will be participating start from nine to 18 years and they aim to rank them like the seniors. Countries can enter as many  swimmers as they can to take part in the competition. The event will now become an annual competition on the Zone IV calendar in order to develop swimming and   competition within the region at junior level.
