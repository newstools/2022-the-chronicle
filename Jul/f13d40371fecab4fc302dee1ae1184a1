It’s the first time in Gwanda we are doing it at The Phoenix Tshisanyama. Activities will include performing artists, modelling, fashion designers’ stalls, fashion brands, 360 booth Birthday celebrations, musk Up dress code and after party,” he said. DJ Joe the OG said 22 Gwanda artists will get a chance to perform. “So, the performing artists include Afro Legacy, Maseko the Poet, Zwelithini Mjabulisi, Nera, King Lenny, Sbhev, Hlasera, Shammie, Gerry, Tariq, Black Element, Brian Drei, Eltian, Emkay the kid, Gegana, Lotis, Swae Savage, Twist, YNGDEE, Tinnel, Tyda Williams and Xervey.
