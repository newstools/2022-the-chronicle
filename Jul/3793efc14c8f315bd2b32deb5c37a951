CHICKEN Inn’s leading scorer, Brian Muza, who has scored ten goals so far, is subject to a late fitness test ahead of today’s crunch tie against Harare giants Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium. Muza, scorer of the solitary goal in the first leg played in February at the National Sports Stadium when the Gamecocks gave DeMbare a reality championship dream check, picked up a knock in Wednesday’s training session. The pint-sized stocky striker, who is in his debut Premiership season, has been a marvel for second placed Chicken Inn, who are keen on building up from last weekend’s 3-1 derby win against Bulawayo Chiefs. Declaring his charges ready for DeMbare, Antipas raised concerns about his top marksman. <img class="wp-image-621889 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-52-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas “The guys have been working hard at training and competition has been stiff. Muza picked up a knock at training on Wednesday and will have to pass a late fitness test to be done in camp, otherwise all the other guys are available for selection. “In terms of players’ attitude, Dynamos is Dynamos and it’s one game that you don’t need to psyche up the players, it’s a self-motivating fixture. We’re ready to play them,” said Antipas. Chicken Inn, who normally play their matches at Luveve Stadium, trained at Barbourfields Stadium on Thursday in preparation for their big game. Chicken Inn scorers against Bulawayo Chiefs, Brett Amidu, Marlvin Hwata and Munashe Pini are expected to play a key role in Gamecocks’ search for a win. Goalkeeper Pride Zendera, who saved a penalty against Chiefs, could start ahead of Donovan Bernard whose move to South Africa’s Sekhukhune hit a brick wall, forcing the player to return to Bulawayo. <img class="wp-image-630811 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-25-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-25-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-25-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pride Zendera Bernard trained with the Gamecocks yesterday. Sources said Bernard felt “belittled” by Sekhukhune, who told him that they wanted to give the fringe national team goalie trials before he signs a contract. While Chicken Inn have all their players available for selection, Dynamos will miss at least four of their key players.
Shadreck Nyahwa, Ralph Kawondera, King Nadolo and Brandon Mpofu are out of the game owing to injury and illness. Youngster Bill Antonio is also not available after sneaking out of the country for trials in Belgium. Meanwhile, in other matches set for today, table-toppers FC Platinum face relegation threatened ZPC Kariba who are fifth from the bottom with 22 points at Mandava Stadium, with Yadah playing host to Benjani Mwaruwari-coached Ngezi Platinum Stars at the National Sports Stadium, while Cranborne Bullets lock horns with Harare City in Rusape.
