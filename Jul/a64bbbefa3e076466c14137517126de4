ZIMBABWEANS should be wary of the country’s detractors posing as opposition political parties and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using food handouts to confuse people, Zanu-PF second secretary Cde Kembo Mohadi has said. <img class="wp-image-624268 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF The warning comes in the wake of renewed attempts by the country’s detractors to effect illegal regime change in Zimbabwe using their pawns in the opposition, civil society, trade unions and NGOs. Cde Mohadi was on a tour of Matabeleland North recently where he interfaced with traditional leaders and the party’s District Coordinating Committees in Lupane, Hwange and Binga to drum up support for the revolutionary party ahead of next year’s harmonised elections. He said opposition parties and NGOs were wolves in sheep skin as they dangle food handouts on people yet their motive is to destabilise the country. He said Zimbabwe should remain a unitary state and encouraged citizens not to vote for “these parties because they are an arm of colonialists.” “After the national Cell day, the President sent me to go around the country meeting and talking to people. He instructed me to help unite people and grow the party by explaining its manifesto and that’s what I am doing. As Zanu-PF we don’t own people, we have members who come from among you (traditional leaders). “Even the Bible says let’s be wary of false prophets who come in sheep skin when they are foxes. They come wearing nice clothes of food yet they want to take away your country.  These NGOs bring food so that you go against your own Government. These boys are foxes, let’s be careful about them,” said Cde Mohadi referring to opposition. He said the revolutionary Zanu and PF-Zapu parties united to form Zanu-PF in 1987 and no other party can claim to have liberated Zimbabwe. With specific mention of opposition Zapu, Cde Mohadi said while it is normal to have differences within an organisation, a party is a not an inheritance that can be transferred to a child. “Those are people who only want to confuse you,” he said. Cde Mohadi said it took the nationalists 23 years to defeat the political enemy, independence which ushered the economic revolution happening in the country. He said the second Republic had committed to complete capital projects such as Ziminya Dam in Nkayi, Zhovhe Dam in Matabeleland South and Lake Gwayi-Shangani in Matabeleland North which will have downstream benefits through infrastructure development, food security and jobs creation. Cde Mohadi said his tour of Matabeleland North was also to explain the Second Republic’s development agenda to people and why it is being undertaken in the manner it is being done. He said people need to know how the agenda is actually leading to attainment of vision 2030 and challenged all patriotic citizens to be involved in the development agenda. “We also have to explain to them how the devolution fund is being employed on the ground,” said Cde Mohadi. “The feedback from kraal heads is good. It seems they have been sidelined by us politicians and Government agencies on the ground and now that we have managed to bring them together, they feel very much happy and honoured.” He said such engagements with traditional leaders should be an ongoing exercise because they are the ones in touch with ordinary people. <img class="wp-image-605100 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Cde Mohadi encouraged the party’s District Coordinating Committees to work closely with traditional leaders and to continue making cells towards the target of 5 million votes for President Mnangagwa. He said since the country has between 35 000 and 36 000 villages, if cells are made in each village that translate to a significant number of voters for the ruling party. Cde Mohadi said Zanu-PF leadership will verify the cells. — @ncubeleon
