Zimbabwe and Rwanda yesterday signed three more collaborative frameworks increasing the areas for partnership to 22 as the countries continue excellent working interchanges in many areas. The growing cooperation between the two is built on President Mnangagwa’s vision of advancing economic interchange to improve people’s livelihoods and that is anchored on attaining an upper middle-income society by 2030. <img class="size-full wp-image-597730" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa President Mnangagwa witnessed the signing of the agreements at State House yesterday.

We signed an extradition treaty and this is a very important instrument to be able to deal with criminals who could be here or in Rwanda who committed crimes here,” said Minister Biruta. This year, Rwanda has started recruiting Zimbabweans to fill critical skill gaps in its education sector, exploiting the good bilateral relations that exist between the two countries. The hiring of Zimbabweans is a consummation of the professional memorandum of understanding signed last year that allows the two republics to exchange educational personnel and expertise.
