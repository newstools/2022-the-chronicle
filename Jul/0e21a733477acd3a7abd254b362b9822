Recently, an ERRP 2 monitoring committee was established to assess road works being implemented to prevent shoddy work witnessed in some areas last year. Under the ERRP 2 in the Midlands province, the Government is tarring Woodlands Road in Gweru, Mberengwa-Mataga Road in Mberengwa and rehabilitating Lower Gweru-Crossroads Road. The programme in the Midlands province had been delayed after the Government terminated contracts for six local contractors who had failed to deliver. In an interview, Midlands Provincial Roads Engineer Dennis Mupfurira said following the cancellation of six local contractors who are failing to do the roads rehabilitation works- the Government took over some of the projects while waiting to re-tender others.  <img class="wp-image-630109 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-25-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-25-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-25-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> roads rehabilitation works “As we speak there are several projects taking place across the province because the objectives of ERRP 2 are to improve the road network, which was extensively damaged during the rainy season, and to harness the potential of the transport system in promoting economic growth,” he said. Eng Mupfurira said Woodlands Road tarring which had stalled had recommenced. The Woodlands Road starts from Lower Gweru turn off up to Lower Gweru. Motorists going to Woodlands suburb or Mutasa cemetery or Lower Gweru have been forced to use a detour that goes through Ascot suburb. A Chronicle news crew witnessed workers engaged in demolition and removal, grading and sloping, preparation of the sub base and binder and surface course of the road . Workers have been putting stones on parts of the road to protect it from traffic so that it is not damaged before hot tar and crushed stones are spread. “If you visit part of the road, you can see that we started the tarring process. Right now we are waiting for temperatures to increase before the hot tar is spread on the surface and compressed into the crushed stone foundation. Otherwise all the layout has been done and we have even blocked the road so that no traffic passes. We had a challenge of impatient motorists who would be removing the stones we use to block the road, but after they have seen the Government’s commitment to finishing off the road, they haven’t removed the stones or barriers,” he said. Turning to Mberengwa, Eng Mupfurira said tarring of Mberengwa- Mataga Road had commenced. Mberengwa-Mataga Road also passes through Mnene Mission Hospital which is one of the biggest referral hospitals in Mberengwa District.  “The road starts from Mberengwa centre at Mberengwa turn –off along Zvishavane – Bulawayo Highway and goes down to Mataga Growth Point. It has always been critical to have a road going to the growth point,” he said. Eng Mupfurira said work crews were also waiting for temperatures to increase before putting hot tar and crushed stones. He said the 10 km tarring of part of Mberengwa- West Nicholson road had been completed. “We started tarring part of the Mberengwa- West Nicholson Road and we have completed 10km now. Mberengwa-West Nicholson Road, which will have tarmac, will become the shortest route linking Gweru and Beitbridge,” said Eng Mupfurira. He said rehabilitation of Lower- Gweru – Crossroads Road has also started. “The rehabilitation is starting at Okeechobee and goes right to Crossroads . It’s an important road because motorists were being forced to go to Crossroads via Kwekwe. If the road is rehabilitated, it will cut down the distance from Gweru to Crossroads,” said Eng Mupfurira. Mberengwa North Member of Parliament Cde Tafanana Zhou commended the Government for availing funds to see ERRP 2 through. He said improved road infrastructure was going to result in an economic boom for Mberengwa District which is characterised by bad roads. “West Nicholson road is of great economic value to Mberengwa District and the Midlands Province at large and so is Mberengwa- Mataga road. We commend the Government for the ERRP 2 initiative and other programmes aimed at empowering the people,” said Cde Zhou.
