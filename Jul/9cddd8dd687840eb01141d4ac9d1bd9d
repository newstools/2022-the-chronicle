USA could only manage 139/8 in 20 overs, with their best individual contribution coming from their best batter Steven Taylor, who hit 46. Left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza was Zimbabwe’s best bowler, taking four wickets for 11 runs in his four overs. Taylor gave USA a flying start in their run chase, putting on 55 for the first-wicket partnership with skipper Monank Patel. <img class="wp-image-613270 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Joel-Luphahla-on-the-touch-lin.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Joel-Luphahla-on-the-touch-lin.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Joel-Luphahla-on-the-touch-lin-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joel Luphahla Richard Ngarava provided the much-needed breakthrough for Zimbabwe when he got Patel caught by Williams. Aaron Jones did not last long at the crease, as he was caught at deep cover by Milton Shumba of the bowling of left-arm spinner Williams for seven runs. Masakadza was introduced into the attack in the 11th over and picked up two wickets. First to depart was USA dangerman Taylor for 46, with Shumba again getting the catch at deep cover before Jaskaran Malhotra was bowled out two balls later. Masakadza took his third wicket when he forced Gajanand Singh to hit the ball into the hands of Ryan Burl. At that stage, USA were under pressure, as the run rate continued to climb and they could not cope with the Zimbabwe bowling attack and fielding which plugged all gaps and dried the runs. Zimbabwe also enjoyed great support from fans, who turned up in their numbers, as entry was for free. <img class="wp-image-627904 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-50-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-50-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-50-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wellington Masakadza Highlanders head coach Baltemar Jose de Oliveira Brito and his assistants Antonio Torres and Joel Luphahla, as well as first team players were also among the crowd supporting the Chevrons. Meanwhile, Papua New Guinea managed to squeeze into the semis despite losing to Hong Kong by two wickets in the last ball of the match at BAC. Papua New Guinea posted 185/7, but Babar Hayat’s 86 and 42 by Zeeshàn Ali ensured they successfully chased the target to end on 186/8 in 20 overs. — Follow on Twitter @Mdawini_29
