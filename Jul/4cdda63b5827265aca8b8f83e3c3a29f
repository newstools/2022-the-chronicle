The Chronicle Lovemore Kadzura, Harare Bureau Black Rhinos 1-1 Yadah BLACK Rhinos moved four places up the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League table despite being held to a draw by a determined Yadah at Vengere Stadium in Rusape yesterday. Rhinos, who were ninth going into yesterday’s match, jumped to fifth place courtesy of a point gained in an evenly balanced match. The Miracle Boys were the first to settle down and took control of the game and had a glorious opportunity to take the lead in the seventh minute when Kudakwashe Mangami came face-to-face with goalkeeper Blessing Mwandimutsira, who stretched out his leg to block the shot. It was then Rhinos’ turn to miss when their Congolese forward Eli Ilunga shot into the side net in the 27th minute. The army side was then forced to pull out captain Farai Banda due to injury. His replacement Blessing Mbavarira blocked a goal bound shot with his hand and referee Arnold Ncube pointed to the spot.  Nkosi Mhlanga took the responsibility and scored past a diving Mwandimutsira to give Yadah the lead. Rhinos returned from the breather a resurgent side and were rewarded in the 79th minute when Yadah defender Brian Kadamanja fouled Vincent Mhandu inside the box and Dennis Dauda converted the resultant penalty. Rhinos’ substitute Stanley Murove could have stolen all three points for his team in the 84th minute, but he blasted his effort wide. <img class="wp-image-621892 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-53-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Yadah Herbert Maruva, the Rhinos coach, was satisfied with the result saying they can still sneak into the championship race. “We did well today. Title contenders are slowly losing grip and dropping points every week and we have to capitalise on that. You never know what will happens,” said Maruva. Yadah coach Genesis Mangombe said his charges did well to pick up a point on the road. “It’s an away point gained against a good side. The game was quite physical, but our boys were up to the task,” he said.
