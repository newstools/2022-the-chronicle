The Chronicle LEADING short-term insurance firm Moovah says farmers should take up its agriculture insurance packages that protect large-scale and smallholder producers from weather-related crop damage and other shocks, especially during this winter season. This comes as very low temperatures this winter have left some farmers in some parts of the country counting their losses. Several crops that do not thrive under cold weather such as tomatoes, potatoes, green mealies, and butternut squash are already recording considerably high failure rates due to the extreme weather.  While winter wheat is tolerant to cold temperatures, it is generally affected by frost conditions during critical growth stages, such as flowering. Moovah, a subsidiary of diversified digital and fintech giant EcoCash Holdings Zimbabwe Limited, said with some farmers witnessing their significant investments go down the drain, agriculture insurance can provide them with the much-needed financial protection. <img class="wp-image-610006 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tomatoes “Our crop insurance policy covers agriculture producers against unforeseeable losses arising from natural and unnatural disasters. “The disasters covered by Moovah Crop Insurance include crop destruction by windstorm, uncontrollable pests, stray animals, fire, frosts,” said Moovah. Agriculture is a significant contributor to Zimbabwe’s economy, employing almost two-thirds of the country’s working population and contributing about eight percent to GDP. However, its consumption of insurance service is very minimal, contributing 3,35 percent of the gross premium written in the first quarter of last year. Moovah said it was also crucial for smallholder farmers in the country, who are the highest producers of diverse food crops, with an estimated supply output of over 80 percent of all agricultural produce consumed in Zimbabwe, to prioritise insurance, given that the country is prone to climate change-related risks, including extreme weather events. Over the last decade, the agriculture sector has been exposed to weather-induced losses caused by harsh weather patterns, such as hailstorms, cyclones and dry spells. <img class="wp-image-627880 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-47-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-47-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-47-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> butternut squash To help improve agricultural insurance penetration in Zimbabwe, Moovah has provided farmers with access to innovative and affordable financial products and services, targeted at mitigating the effects of global warming and other risks, for resilient and sustainable agricultural production. “With Moovah Crop Insurance, you also enjoy discounted rates on insuring other farm assets,” the company said.
