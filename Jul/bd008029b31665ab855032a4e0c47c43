Twenty-three years ago, one of the makers of this country, Dr Joshua Nkomo died. He lost his battle against prostate cancer aged 82. Like most blacks in colonial Zimbabwe, he had a humble professional beginning as a carpenter having undergone technical training in Tsholotsho. However, the never-say-die spirit in him took him to South Africa where he graduated with a degree in social work, his first of other degrees to come. <img class="size-full wp-image-556926" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo He returned home and secured a job as a social worker for the Rhodesian Railways, now the National Railways of Zimbabwe. That was in the 1940s. Like most of his contemporaries, he was involved in labour unionism which became the foundation for his impressive political career. He was heavily involved in black demands for fair labour practices at a time when whites had everything their way in the country. In the 1948 general strike, the first general strike in the history of this country, he was among the leading lights together with the likes of Benjamin Burombo, Grey Bango and others. It was obvious that Dr Nkomo would graduate into politics — the African National Congress of Rhodesia and the National Democratic Party both of which he led as president. After both were banned in quick succession, he was elected president of Zimbabwe African People’s Union (Zapu). It was during his time in Zapu that the armed struggle, the most confrontational stage for Independence started. He also led the party’s armed wing, the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army. <img class="size-full wp-image-622891" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Benjamin-Burombo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Benjamin-Burombo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Benjamin-Burombo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benjamin Burombo Together with sister party and armed wing Zanu and Zanla, they prosecuted the liberation struggle that yielded Independence on April 18, 1980. He was Home Affairs Minister in the first post-Independence Cabinet and became Vice-President of Zanu-PF and Government at the signing of the Unity Accord in December 1987. He served in those capacities until his death on July 1, 1999. We learn a lot from his life. His patriotism, selflessness, pursuit for unity and national development. Said President Mnangagwa about the legend:
“The late Father Zimbabwe, the former Vice-President Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo, just the name Father Zimbabwe already speaks volumes as to who that person was, was the father of our nationalism in Zimbabwe from as early as the early 1950s. So, it is necessary that we keep his memory alive from generation to generation.  “It is the duty for us the leaders today to make sure that we observe and commemorate his life. Now, the first of July will be the twenty third anniversary of his death so we remember him for his contribution and sacrifice throughout his life, he lived for this country, he struggled for this country, he went to war for this country and today we are free.”
