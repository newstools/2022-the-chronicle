THE National Association of Primary Heads (Naph) Matabeleland North hosts provincial ball games finals at Loziba Sports Grounds in Inyathi tomorrow. Each of the province’s seven districts, Binga, Bubi, Hwange, Lupane, Nkayi, Tsholotsho and Umguza, will be represented by a team in football, netball, basketball and volleyball.  By virtue of being hosts, Bubi will have two teams in each sport code, bringing to eight teams that will participate in each discipline. Besides ball games, there will be a quiz competition conducted by a private stakeholder, Music Consultancy Society, to raise awareness about visual performing arts activities among primary school learners. Sport and art constitute part of the new competence-based learning curriculum. <img class="wp-image-576216 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/netball-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/netball-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/netball-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> netball Government recently allowed schools to resume sporting activities noting that measures introduced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 were bearing fruit, and learning institutions immediately set the ball rolling with competitions at cluster, zonal and district level, which culminated in today’s provincial finals. Naph Matabeleland North provincial secretary Nelson Nhlalo Masukume said yesterday was dedicated to vetting teams, with players expected to be formal learners aged between 12 and 14 years. “These are teams that went to cluster and won and became champions at district level.

He said the full list of teams expected to participate were supposed to be confirmed by the end of day yesterday after the arrival of all districts. <img class="wp-image-436024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/basketball-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/basketball-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/basketball-680x380-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> basketball The host district will be represented by Balanda Primary in football, Lukala in basketball and volleyball, and netball will have Mbembeswana and Lukona.
