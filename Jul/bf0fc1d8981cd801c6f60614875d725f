The Chronicle Sports Reporter MARATHON and health and fitness fans will celebrate the return of the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon tomorrow morning, with thousands set to take part in the popular event. The marathon makes a physical return to the resort city after two years following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions that had suspended all sporting events. Lifting of restrictions opened the door for close to 5 000 participants from around the world to register for one of Africa’s premier marathons because of its unique route through the Zambezi National Park. However, all participants, including coaches and officials, have to produce a negative Covid-19 test result taken 48 hours before the marathon, or a fully vaccinated certificate. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623506 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-40-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief operating officer Kezito Makuni, an ardent marathon runner himself, said tomorrow’s marathon was special because it comes at a time economies in the region and across the world are starting to recover from effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. “This year’s marathon is special as it marks the reopening of borders and economies and the return of visitors to our beautiful resort and tourist destinations around the country following the pandemic, along with the economic benefits it brings to Victoria Falls and the hospitality and tourism sector in general,” said Makuni. The marathon is entirely supported by local organisations, creating business and local employment opportunities for the Victoria Falls community and the hospitality and tourism sector. Makuni said crowd and traffic control are provided at the marathon. “As in past events, we can assure visitors and athletes of world-class organisation and crowd and traffic control, including communications and sweep cars, route marshals, clear signage, water at several points along the routes and most importantly, adequate first aid, medical and emergency services for the whole duration of the marathon,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623509 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-41-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Econet has been sponsoring the marathon since 2009 and it has over the years become a favourite and important event, drawing runners from around the world and across all categories, ranging from some of the world’s elite runners to a large and growing number of health conscious and wellness-minded amateur athletes. Makuni said Econet is a strong proponent of health and wellness in the workplace and in families, and will once again use the marathon to encourage members of the public to adopt healthy lifestyles, which include active exercise and jogging. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623512 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Besides helping to set the stage for this wonderful experience at a top tourist resort, we will be once again using the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon as a vital platform to spread the word on the importance of keeping communities healthy through active lifestyles,” he said. To underpin its growing importance, the Econet Vic Falls Marathon has earned the recognition of World Athletics and the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS). The event features a rebranded Elephant route, which is the 42,2km full marathon, Leopard route (21,1km half marathon), Lion route (7,5km Family Fun Run) and the 2×10,5km relay.
