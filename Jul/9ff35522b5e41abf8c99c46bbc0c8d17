He is set to share the stage with Asaph, King Mo and Jah Nera. On the decks, DJ Mzoe, Kead Wikead and Henry HP will take care of business. The following day, the Mwana Ndakubirai hit-maker will upscale rap music in the border town of Plumtree at a show to be held at KoNdabayakhe (Ex Dumms Palace). He will be accompanied by Etherton B and Garry B while DJ Carter and DJ Lexi will turn the tables. The 10-track album has delighted fans and music lovers alike as evidenced by trending videos of past tours. Organiser of the shows, Dee Nosh who this year, embarked on a mission to promote local talent said the tour is meant to grow the rap industry.  “Through the Energy tour, Holy Ten is collaborating with various hip-hop artistes who want to push their music throughout the country. He approached me to work with him and he couldn’t have done this at a better time as I’m also hosting several shows with local acts to promote them. “We opted to have a show in Plumtree because not many hip-hop shows have been taking place there so this is our way of growing the genre,” said Dee Nosh. <img class="wp-image-624838 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-61.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-61.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-61-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Audiomack The album that was released last month is available on different online platforms such as YouTube, Audiomack and Spotify.
