The Chronicle PRESIDENT Mnangagwa on Thursday commissioned a US$7 million detonators plant at Intrachem Explosives Company in Kwekwe. The new plant which has an import substitution value of up to US$20 million per year, is set to boost production of mining explosives at the company.

President Mnangagwa said the young investors had taken heed of the Government’s call for Zimbabwean professionals working in the diaspora to return home and contribute to the development of their country. “I am very pleased that these young engineers who were working in SA decided to return and invest back home taking advantage of the conducive investment environment that Government has created,” said President Mnangagwa. He said the young investors have said the market for their products is very huge and as such were at the moment failing to meet demand. President Mnangagwa said Government will therefore do its best to assist the new investors to expand and boost production. Engineers are among Zimbabwean professionals who left the country to seek greener pastures. The country has churned out about 6 000 civil, mechanical, architectural and scientific engineers but a few remain in the country. <img class="size-full wp-image-603096" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-1-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-1-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-1-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa We want at this juncture to call on professionals working in the diaspora to return and invest back home like what the owners of Intrachem Explosives Company have done.
