The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent BILATERAL relations between Zimbabwe and India continue to deepen with the two countries now looking into expanding trade linkages to different sectors of the economy. Zimbabwe has enjoyed cordial relations with India since the precolonial era and over the years India has supported the local education and energy programmes.  Speaking on the sidelines of a health clinic programme organised by the Indian Embassy in Kwekwe last Sunday, Indian Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Vijay Khanduja, said the two countries were now looking at broadening their relations to other key sectors of the economy. “We have enjoyed a good and friendly relationship with Zimbabwe. In recent times it’s actually broadening as we move into energy, health, education and skills development, as well as other key sectors of the economy,” he said. <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay Amb Khanduja said the health camp initiative, which benefitted more than 2 000 people through free medication and treatment, was also a sign of how the ties between the two countries are growing. The Indian Embassy, working together with the Indian Community in Kwekwe, organised the health camp where drugs worth about US$1 500 were distributed. This was part of events lined up to celebrate the Indian 75 Independence Anniversary celebrations in Zimbabwe, said the Ambassador. “We are having the 75th celebrations of India Independence and we are organising a number of activities including these people centred programmes across all provinces and this health camp is part of it,” he said. “We are also organising cultural celebrations and other events but we wanted programmes that benefit the community the most.” <img class="wp-image-627118 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/monica.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/monica.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/monica-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa This comes as the Government is pushing for Zimbabwe and India to improve their information communication technologies (ICTs) trade cooperation as these relations still lag behind. Recently while delivering her keynote address at the 17th CII-EXIM Bank Conclave on India-Africa Growth Partnership held in New Delhi in India, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, said the Second Republic was keen to tap from India’s technological advancements as it forges towards developing the country into an upper middle-income economy by 2030. She said India has realised the full benefits of digital economies, which has resulted in the financial inclusion for most of its citizens. “India has demonstrated prowess in developing the intellectual property of the emerging digital economy. It has exhibited outstanding capabilities in computer software development,” said the minister. <img class="wp-image-460626 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Intellectual-Property-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Intellectual-Property-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Intellectual-Property--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> intellectual property “The advent of the internet and digital economy has seen New Delhi harness this prowess for the goal of total national digital inclusiveness. “All digital platforms are being systematically integrated so that digital content fully replaces paper and other analogue legacy-based media foundations.” Minister Mutsvangwa said Zimbabwe and India trade relations date back to the precolonial era hence there is a need to strengthen economic ties.
