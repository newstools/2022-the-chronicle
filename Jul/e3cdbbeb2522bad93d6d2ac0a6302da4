Runners came from more than 30 countries while hundreds more turned up to cheer their loved ones and enjoy holiday as family and groups. The Victoria Falls border was closed between 6am and 9am on Sunday to allow free passage of the marathon participants to the Victoria Falls Bridge. There was traffic congestion along Park Way from town to the Big Tree turn-off, as vehicles gave way to runners whose route followed the route into Courtney Selous Avenue. Tourism authorities said the marathon had grown to be Victoria Falls’ flagship event and dovetails with Government Meetings Incentives Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) initiative, which is one of the strategies towards achieving a US$5 billion tourism industry by 2025. To the tourism industry it was the first-time operators exhibited on the sidelines of the annual event at Elephant Hills Golf Course. A record crowd gathered at the golf course where a Zumba dance session was done creating a carnival atmosphere.

So, for me this marks a success for the event to promote domestic tourism. We want more and more such events where people can come together and operators are able to offer their services and tourism is booming again,” said Ms Muchanyuka. She commended the downstream effect of tourism as shown through the exhibition. “It is encouraging to see so many smiles from all ages after Covid-19 and if we can continue to have this, it will be a success for the tourism operators. “All the operators including enabling industries are out exhibiting. I am really excited and for something like this to happen in my first month gives me so much hope for the industry,” said Ms Muchanyuka. She said the marathon adds to a cocktail of events on Team Tourism Zimbabwe plans including roadshows as a way of marketing the destination. Econet chief operating officer, Mr Kezito Makuni, said the marathon was the telecommunications company’s way of contributing to tourism growth through MICE. He said they opted for Elephant Hills as the facility exudes a world class brand to project a good image of the country to international visitors. Runners went through the Victoria Falls Border and Bridge, which Mr Makuni said was the special part of the marathon as it gives athletes an opportunity to experience the light Victoria Falls showers and view the magnificent bridge and gorges.  “Econet Victoria Falls Marathon is going to continue as we are a strong believer in wellness. As you are aware, the Government has the MICE programme and we believe that the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon contributes to that,” she said. “We have many participants from different countries in the region and internationally and as they come, they realise that some of the narratives they hear about our country might be wrong,” said Mr Makuni, who has participated in the 21km race for years. Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe national chair Mr Farai Chimba said there should be efforts to have many exhibitions. “We welcome such events, which are part of big MICE thrust and we are quite happy as the hospitality association that we have seen three different events so far — Mapopoma Festival and Carnival and this one, which is obviously the flagship event in Victoria Falls drawing over 3 000 participants. We also got overflow of family and other people taking time to enjoy,” he said. “For us this is quite significant and these are sort of events we should continue to drive towards to put our destination on the map and overally spread tourism across provinces. “This definitely should be supported as we should draw more events that will bring a lot of downstream business,” he said. Mr Chimba who is Victoria Falls Hotel general manager said operators went out to exhibit at the event so as to give full value to their clients off premises. He said this is what drew people to the marathon compared to other events, which give services to specific operators thereby presenting better opportunities. Victoria Falls City Mayor Councillor Somveli Dlamini said the city was buoyed by the huge turnout and business opportunities. “We believe this will go a long way in enhancing and boosting tourism in Victoria Falls as well as changing our fortunes in as far the tourism economy of the city is concerned,” he said. <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 “We are coming straight from Covid-19 and lodges are full and there is a lot of employment creation which we believe will help improve revenue for the city,” he said. — @ncubeleon
