Nkulumane-based Charleston Trust Primary School Choir has been nominated for the upcoming African Children of the Year Awards (ACOTYA) to be held in South Africa in November. <img class="wp-image-629812 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> African Children of the Year Awards (ACOTYA) It all started last year with the release of their debut single, Colour My Dreams. Those dreams might be coming to fruition as the choir is an Arts and Culture nominee for the ACOTYA. The ACOTYA which is in its fifth edition is a brainchild of Stacey Fru Foundation with Stacey Fru being the custodian of the awards. Stacey Fru is an award-winning bestselling author of chapter books in the world who wrote her first book at the age of seven without her parents’ knowledge.  ACOTYA competition coordinator, Dorcas Gwenhure said the awards are meant to establish sound African leaders. “Our intention and goal is to establish an Africa with future leaders that say ‘I CAN’. Any child between the ages of seven and 13 is eligible to enter any category. Children under seven and already 14 can be entered in the Special Mentioned category,” said Gwenhure. Charleston Trust Primary School Choir director Trevor Mawaka welcomed the development, saying this year has been good. “It’s a great feeling to be nominated for a regional award. It’s been a great year for the children. We’ve recorded three songs and three videos, of which the most recent (Son of Africa) is getting great airplay on stations like Skyz Metro FM, Khulumani FM, and Classic 263. <img class="wp-image-626707 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Charleston-Trust-Primary-School-Choir.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Charleston-Trust-Primary-School-Choir.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Charleston-Trust-Primary-School-Choir-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We’ve had a couple of shows and have been invited to the annual Let Them School Arts Festival taking place on the 30th of July in Domboshava. The children have given it their all and getting such a nomination has uplifted them to great heights. We’re really humbled,” said Mawaka. Submission for entries for the awards is ongoing and should be done before the end of August. The final selection should be done by mid-November. Awards up for grabs at the event to be held at the Profound Conference Centre in Johannesburg include Safety and Security, Arts and Culture, Education and Skills Development, Philanthropist, Leadership, Community development/Engagement, Motivational/Personal Development, Science and Technology, Sports and Recreation, Entrepreneurship as well as a Special Mention. The Special Mention award will be Stacey Fru’s selection of the child who wows the judges. This category is in recognition of the first award that she ever won. – @eMKlass_49
