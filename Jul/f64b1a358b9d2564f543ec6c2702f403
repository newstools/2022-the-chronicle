Moyo already has a laptop that was donated to the club by Dingani Bookshop and yesterday’s donation by TTI was another big shot in the arm for office staff as the club continues to reach out for assistance from individuals and corporates. TTI’s managing director, Bongani Nyathi said this was a start of a mutually beneficial relationship between his company and the football giant.  “This is the beginning of good relations that we want to foster with the club. As a company that serves the Bulawayo public, we saw it fit to respond to Highlanders’ appeal for assistance,” sid Nyathi. <img class="wp-image-624535 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso Nyathi, who is staunch Bosso supporter, said he hopes other companies will  also assist.

He also revealed that other members of Highlanders had donated another laptop and a camera for the club’s media department.
