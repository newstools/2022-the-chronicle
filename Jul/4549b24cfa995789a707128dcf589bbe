THE construction of Lupane Provincial Hospital, set to be the country’s biggest public institution, is progressing well with some sections of the facility likely to be commissioned soon. Authorities have said if all goes according to plan, the hospital will open its doors to the public this year. The hospital is expected to ease pressure on Mpilo Central Hospital and United Bulawayo Hospitals which also serve the southern region of the country. Upon its completion, the hospital will be the first provincial hospital for Matabeleland province. <img class="size-full wp-image-473700" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Mpilo-Central-Hospital-in-Bulawayo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Mpilo-Central-Hospital-in-Bulawayo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Mpilo-Central-Hospital-in-Bulawayo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mpilo Central Hospital It is the Second Republic’s vision to construct critical infrastructure countrywide to reduce the distance travelled by citizens to access services, one of the tenets of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) The Second Republic has made construction of the Lupane hospital a top priority and last year Government allocated $47 million for the project. The Government is upping the tempo when it comes to decentralising services to provincial, district or even ward level to ensure access to critical services for all citizens. In an interview, Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Richard Moyo, said much progress has been done in terms of completing the massive hospital. He said a decision is yet to be made on whether some sections will be open to the public before completion of the whole hospital. <img class="size-full wp-image-615864" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-74-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-74-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-74-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Cde Richard Moyo “The construction is coming up very well and I am glad to say we have managed to complete roofing in some of the major buildings. We are happy with the pace and confident that soon, our people will be able to benefit from this hospital which will save lives,” said Minister Moyo. “Some sections are almost 100 percent complete and we await guidance to determine if these can be commissioned before the hospital is complete so that people start benefiting from certain departments.” He said the central stores has been completely roofed and plastered overall completion stands at 65 percent. Ceilings hanging for the same building is at 100 percent while electricity tubing and wiring is in progress. <img class="size-full wp-image-613666" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Lupane-Govt-complex-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Lupane-Govt-complex-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Lupane-Govt-complex-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The nearly complete Lupane Provincial Hospital staff residence “The pharmacy is now completely roofed, with internal plastering at 100 percent while rhinoset plastering is at 95 percent. Plumbing works are waiting for internal fittings, hanging of brandering and rhino boards at 95 percent and overall progress is at 62 percent,” he said. Minister Moyo said the casualty department has been roofed and that electrical and plumbing is in progress. “The twin buildings that will house the outpatient department are at roof level and internal plastering is at 90 percent. The administration block is at roof level and is waiting for trusses and roof cover. Also of note is the fact that roofing is in progress for the staff accommodation.” He said the eye and dental building is now under construction as footing, sub structure brick work and concrete slab pouring are 100 percent complete. The paediatric ward is nine percent complete as the sub-super structure brickwork on footing has been completed.  “The surgical ward, maternity ward, theatre, kitchen and labour ward are also coming up as footing has been done. We are happy and grateful for the commitment by Government to ensure that we also have our own provincial hospital,” said Minister Moyo. The Government under the Second Republic remains committed to improving healthcare services through building and revamping facilities to achieve Vision 2030. More than 47 clinics and hospitals have been built since 2018 under the Second Republic with many more being upgraded and repaired. Quality health care services are among the pillars of an upper middle class economy which the Government is working to achieve by 2030. -@thamamoe
