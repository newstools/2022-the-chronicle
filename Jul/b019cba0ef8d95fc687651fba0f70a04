ZIFA Southern Region Division One log leaders Hwange say they are solely focused on winning their own fixtures and not concentrating on performances of the chasing pack. Hwange top the log with 48 points followed by Arenel on 45 points, ZPC Hwange (43) and Talen Vision (41). Mathematically, all top four teams have a chance of winning the league, but that has not put pressure on Hwange, who have made their intentions for a return to topflight football clear. The coalminers’ coach Edmore “Mamkhwebu” Sibanda said: “Our goal is to win our games. <img class="wp-image-625570 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-59-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-59-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-59-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Edmore “Mamkhwebu” Sibanda We are not worried about how the teams around us are playing. Of course, the gap between us and the second-placed team is minimal, but that does not put pressure on us. The key is just to win our games and not focus on other teams.” Hwange face Binga Pirates in their next league match at the Colliery, and are eyeing three points to maintain the gap between them and Arenel. “We have prepared well for this game.  Everything in our camp is stable and the boys are in high spirits. We are going into the game to win and hopefully we do that. It is not an easy game because the opponents are a tricky side to face. We have to approach it with the greatest of intensity and make sure we get three points,” said Sibanda. Hwange suffered their second defeat of the season when they went down 0-1 to Talen Vision at Mthwakazi Stadium in Filabusi last weekend. Kelvin Chigonero scored the only goal of the match from a corner kick in the first-half to condemn Hwange to yet another 0-1 loss after they lost by a similar margin against second-placed Arenel Movers at White City Stadium two weeks ago. <img class="wp-image-607803 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> White City Stadium The loss saw Hwange dropping their lead to just three points after Arenel overpowered Mainline 2-1.
