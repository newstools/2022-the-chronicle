The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Chevrons will be seeking to carry the momentum from their recent success at the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, which they won in Bulawayo two weeks ago, when they face Bangladesh in the first of three T20 international matches set for Harare Sports Club. Winning the tournament played in Bulawayo sealed their place at this year’s ICC T20 World Cup finals set for Australia in October. For the Chevrons, focus now shifts to Bangladesh as preparation for the World Cup gets underway. The series will open with back-to-back T20I fixtures, today and on Sunday, with the final match scheduled for Tuesday. The two sides will then lock horns in as many ODIs set for August 5, 7 and 10 at the same venue. Fast bowlers, Tendai Chatara and Blessing Muzarabani have been ruled out of Zimbabwe squad for the three Twenty20 Internationals against Bangladesh owing to injury.  Chatara suffered a collarbone fracture while Muzarabani sustained a thigh muscle tear. Their replacements during that eight-team contest, all-rounder Tony Munyonga and pace bowler Tanaka Chivanga, have also been retained in the squad that will take on Bangladesh. Zimbabwe Cricket have set the ticket prices at US$2 for the rest of the ground, US$3 for the Embankment side and US$5 for the Centurion. <img class="wp-image-609558 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pensioners and children in full school uniforms are set to get in for free.
