ZIMBABWE National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board (ZNBWCB) chief executive officer Lawrence Zimbudzana says the sport has to adapt to the current socio-economic challenges bedevilling the continent for it to be used as an impeccable tool for peace building and general socio-economic development. ZNBWCB is due to host the World Boxing Council (WBC) All-Africa Officials Training and Grading Workshop and the Africa Boxing Union (ABU) gathering in Victoria Falls from July 25-27 and July 26-27 respectively. “The hosting of these two events is meant to enhance the technical capacities of boxing officials across the continent and define the governance structure of boxing in Africa for the next five years as well as exploring strategies of modernising and developing boxing at all levels on the African continent,” said Zimbudzana. <img class="wp-image-628534 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Boxing “As Zimbabwe, we believe we can play a role at continental level to ensure that our people realise their aspirations. Africa has to wake up and work towards its own emancipation and development.” The two events will attract delegates from around the African continent, with an average of 100 delegates expected to attend each of the two events. ABU president and WBC vice-president Houcine Houchi will preside over the proceedings. The workshop will target boxing technical officials from African countries and affiliates from other WBC regions.  “We have been provided with a rare opportunity to market the country as sport tourism destination of choice and at the same time setting the stage for the hosting of future international boxing conventions and tournaments. We are not only focusing on Victoria Falls, but Zimbabwe as a whole, and that is why we are partnering the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority. However, special interest will be on Victoria Falls as we seek to make it the hub of all combat sport activities,” said Zimbudzana. The online registration platform was opened on June 1 and by July 13, 106 delegates had registered for the events.
Confirmed delegates so far are drawn from 17 countries, South Africa, Botswana, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Namibia, Cameron, Egypt, Zambia, Zimbabwe, DRC, Ghana, Mali, USA, Morocco and Ireland. According to Zimbudzana, hosting the workshop is an initiative aligned to the ZNBCWB vision of being an ‘excelling and inclusive combat sport nation by 2030’. – @innocentskizoe
