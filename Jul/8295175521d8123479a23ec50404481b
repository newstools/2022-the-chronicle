It’s in the middle of the year and Msiz’kay is helping people look forward to planning their weddings through his song Kulula. Featuring the talented songstress Bhekiwe, the song is the lead single for his recently released self-titled album Sizalobuhle, a dedication to his late mother. The album was launched last month at the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo at a successful event. <img class="wp-image-625459 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-47-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-47-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-47-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Art Gallery So far, Kulula is the only track on the album that has a video. As of yesterday, it had just over 4 000 views on YouTube. The video whose teasers left people convinced that the artiste had wedded secretly, has a wedding setup that is very convincing. Bhekiwe and Msiz’kay play bride and groom, with Babongile Sikhonjwa as the pastor. And as to be expected, Sikhonjwa will be up to no good doing the popular Umlando dance in some scenes. For people who are already in love, the song is just a final spark to start wedding preparations as it represents a wedding as something worth venturing into. The lyrics of the song suggest that if two people really love each other, being with each other is just easy. Commenting on the song, Msiz’kay told Chronicle Showbiz that it was inspired by the beautiful love experiences around him. “My personal life inspires my music. Kulula is a jam that was brought about by love and the experience of being in love. Through it, we sought to show that if you love your person, if everything goes well, at the end of the day, you’ll marry that person as long as you love them,” he said.  In his circles, besides being known as “umntakaMaMkandla,” the artiste is known as ‘UMsiz’kay ka Nomalanga’ (Nomalanga’s Msiz’kay), a girl whom he mentions in most of his love songs. At his “I love Msiz’kay Concert,” the artiste  told the crowds that Nomalanga was his girlfriend who inspires his love songs. From this background, one can agree that Kulala was inspired by love. Before Kulula people have been jamming to lyrics of Ngawuz’umoya Wami which features rapper Awa Khiwe and Mzoe 7; Cherry Yami; Ngisemathandweni and Inkomo Zamalobolo, which are all love songs where he mentions his girlfriend.
In an environment where most artistes are adopting English language to commercialise their works, Msiz’kay continues to drop his songs in Ndebele, a language which most local people relate to. His recently launched album consists of 18 tracks that include Sizalobuhle, Ngingumuntu, Ngingakhul, Recognition 2.0, Nguwe, Monday, Long Live The King, Lento, Emaphathini, Dance For Me, Incwadi, Umalukazana, See me cry and Ingoma Zothando. It also consists of singles that were released last year, Ngokwakith’lokhu, Ngisemathandweni and the popular Ngawuzw’ Umoya Wami. <img class="wp-image-585464 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-15-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-15-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-15-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Awa Khiwe Featured artistes are Awa Khiwe, Bhekiwe, Cosmos Roinuj, CTL, Fab G UmshanakaGogo, Hwabaraty, Luchi Shiki, Mbo Mahocs, MJ Sings and Mzoe7.
