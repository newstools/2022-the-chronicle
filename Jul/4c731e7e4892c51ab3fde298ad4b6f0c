The Chronicle He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church
(1 Corinthians 14:4). <img class="alignnone wp-image-631132 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-318.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-318.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-318-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> WHEN you receive the Holy Spirit, you receive the power of God to reside in you as Jesus said (Acts 1:8). This power is triggered or activated when you speak in other tongues. The Greek word translated “edifieth” in the opening scripture is “oikodomeo,” which means to construct or build up, to embolden or charge up like you’d charge a battery. That verse is therefore telling us that the one who speaks in tongues builds himself up like an edifice; he emboldens himself and charges himself like a battery. When you spend time to speak in other tongues, you’re building up your spirit: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost” (Jude 1:20). If you were weak in your Christian life, as you speak in other tongues, the power of God that had lain dormant within you would be stirred and you’ll be strengthened to do the things of God. Speaking in tongues is the antidote to fear and timidity. God hasn’t given you the spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Activate the power within you by spending time speaking in other tongues; do this every day and every so often.  Your inner man will be built up strong and you’ll constantly walk in dominion over all your adversaries. Also, speaking in tongues empowers you to preach. I heard the testimony of a nine-year-old boy who was timid and unable to preach to his friends. After he began speaking in tongues, he became confident, and the hitherto timid boy became a bold preacher of the Gospel everywhere. There’s no limitation as to what the Spirit of God can do in your life if you’d spend time to speak in other tongues every day, knowing that you’re speaking mysteries to God, which will provide divine wisdom. Furthermore, speaking in other tongues aids “quick charge” and causes your spirit to respond quickly to divine signals. Speaking in other tongues is a great blessing. <img class="alignnone wp-image-631138 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-319.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-319.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-319-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> You can learn more about this from our book, “The Power of Tongues.” Get it and study it carefully and expose your spirit to the rich benefits of “glossolalia” (Greek)— speaking in tongues. PRAYER Dear Father, I thank you for the invigorating, revitalising, refreshing, energizing and edifying experience of speaking in tongues. There’s a transformation in all that concerns me; my spirit is conditioned for success, excellence, prosperity and victory. As I speak in tongues even now, out of my belly flow gushers of living waters; words of salvation, healing and strength flow through me to my world, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Amen
