The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo, Mat South Bureau Chief THE Municipality of Gwanda has started impounding stray cattle, which have become a menace in the mining town. Cattle, goats and donkeys roam the busy streets of the town centre and residential areas. The stray animals also threaten the mining town’s urban status. Gwanda Mayor, Councillor Njabulo Siziba confirmed the development saying it was important to maintain the town’s image in line with 21st century standards. <img class="alignnone wp-image-632587 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The Municipality has started impounding stray cattle and the owners of the cattle can only access them after paying a fine or negotiating for a payment plan. Cattle shouldn’t be kept in towns. It’s painful for those who will have their cattle impounded but we also have to consider the residents. Some of them rely on their vegetable gardens for sustenance. It becomes disastrous when stray cattle destroy or eat those vegetables,” said Cllr Siziba. He said stray cattle are a nuisance at night and disturb the peace.  “They have bells and make a lot of noise, people can hardly sleep. Those who own cattle should be considerate and ensure that their beasts are fenced. They should also make sure that they graze outside town and don’t stray into people’s yards. People need to understand that farming is a business so they should hire full time employees to tend to their cattle,” said Cllr Siziba. He said the Gwanda central business district is a window for many tourists who pass through the town to connect to the Beitbridge Highway which leads to neighbouring South Africa. <img class="wp-image-631300 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-12-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-12-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-12-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cattle  “At any time, a tourist can be crossing Gwanda, enroute to whichever country they’re going to. This is the 21st century and we can’t have a central business district with cattle toppling bins or frustrating traffic. I wish people would change their approach and manage their cattle better so that they can preserve their animals’ lives. They must treat farming as a business such that two cows can be sold in order to necessitate the employment of someone to tend to the rest. People need to know that stray cattle will be impounded and they should make provisions to prevent that from happening,” said Cllr Siziba. Residents said the animals come from surrounding farms and their owners allow them to roam freely. Gwanda resident Mr Msizi Msebele said it had now become common to wake up to the noise of the bells of animals.– @Yolisswa
