The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter PLAYERS in the tourism industry are confident that the sector is on the recovery path, which will see it rising to pre-Covid-19 peak levels and contribute towards the drive for the country to become a regional tourism hub. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 Tourism is one of the key economic drivers alongside mining, agriculture and manufacturing and in 2019, the country raked in more than US$1,23 billion from 2,29 million arrivals. However, the sector was one of the worst affected after the global pandemic caused closure of business due to travel restrictions. Following the lifting of lockdown restrictions, the tourism sector is back on recovery mode and authorities say better days lie ahead. Back-to-back conferences and other activities are now back in full swing, especially in Victoria Falls, the prime tourism capital and prospects seem higher, industry leaders say. This augurs well with the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE) tourism, a key component of the Tourism Growth and Recovery Strategy. A snap survey conducted by Chronicle around Victoria Falls has shown that a majority of workers are back at work as most businesses have resumed full scale operations.  Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe national president, Mr Wengai Nhau, said better days lie ahead. “The situation in the industry seems to be on the right path. Victoria Falls was the worst affected when it comes to the impact of Covid-19 but right now it is the fastest growing. Victoria Falls is on the right path to recovery and I think we foresee us going back to 2019 figures soon,” he said. Mr Nhau said it was time now for operators in the whole value chain to revisit their pricing models, which he however, said is dependent on authorities dealing with fundamentals like electricity, fuel and exchange rates, which are key cost drivers. In the last six months, Victoria Falls has hosted three major events — Mapopoma Festival, Victoria Falls Carnival and Econet Victoria Falls Marathon, which all drew large numbers. Hotels and tour operators enjoyed brisk business while scores of locals benefited from job opportunities in the value chain. Improvement in access to the destination has become a key factor with more airlines flying into the resort city. There have also been massive developments with a new US$50 million hotel soon to be built as the destination continues to improve facilities to portray the image that matches international standards. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority chief executive, Ms Winnie Muchanyuka, has said there is need for aggressive marketing of Victoria Falls. She has also engaged industry players and stakeholders in a bid to come up with strategies to aggressively market the destination. “Most hotels and lodges have been full and all these visitors are our tourism ambassadors as we promote growth of tourism. What we need now is to make sure that our teams are delivering service that is expected of a destination not only in Victoria Falls but across the whole country,” said Ms Muchanyuka. <img class="wp-image-617085 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mr-Farai-Chimba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mr-Farai-Chimba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Mr-Farai-Chimba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Farai Chimba Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe national chair, Mr Farai Chimba said there is a need to spread tourism opportunities to downstream industry countrywide. Victoria Falls City Mayor Councillor Somveli Dlamini said growth of tourism will result in improved revenue collection for the council.
