ALL participating teams in the International Cricket Council 2022 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier B set to start in Bulawayo next week have announced their official squads for the competition, except Zimbabwe. The squad will be new coach Dave Houghton’s first pick since he took over from Lalchand Rajput as head coach. Sean Williams, who missed the recent limited-overs series against Namibia and Afghanistan after a family bereavement, is expected to make his way back into the Chevrons’ fold. <img class="wp-image-625066 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-76.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-76.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-76-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Richard Ngarava Others in line for a return are off-spinner Wellington Masakadza and fast bowler Richard Ngarava, who had been out injured, but have since recovered.
