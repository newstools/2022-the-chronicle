The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS might have displayed their worst performance since the arrival of coach Baltemar Brito when they edged Bulawayo City 1-0, but two players — midfielder Divine Mhindirira and Godfrey Makaruse — were outstanding. Makaruse capped a fine afternoon with the solitary goal that bagged Bosso maximum points and moved them to position six from nine on the table. <img class="size-full wp-image-625852" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Baltemar Brito Highlanders struggled with their play, failing to open up their opponents, but Mhindirira was sizzling in central midfield, showing off sheer individual brilliance, with mazy turns and crafty passes that won him a standing ovation from the home team’s supporters. While Mhindirira bossed the midfield, overlapping left back Makaruse charmed spectators with his usual energy. He rarely lost possession. What should be noted is that since the arrival of Brito, before playing City, Highlanders’ playing style had greatly improved, with a superb display against Black Rhinos ended 3-2, the impressive 1-1 away draw at Ngezi Platinum Stars where they had to fight from a goal down to share the spoils.  Bosso were so good when they trampled on Manica Diamonds 3-0 and put up a great show that reignited a sense of belief within the Highlanders family even though they ended on the losing side against Whawha in Gweru. That four-match fine display saw about 4 000 people paying their way to watch Bosso against City, but the former failed to reproduce their dazzling football. But what can’t be denied is that the playing style that Brito has introduced has given both Makaruse and Mhindirira the freedom to shine and freely express themselves. <img class="size-full wp-image-631102" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-22-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-22-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-22-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Divine Mhindirira (kneeling) The 25-year-old Makaruse was converted from an attacking midfielder to leftback, giving him freedom to read the game before making calculated moves before venturing upfront. As for 22-year-old Mhindirira, a player with less charisma, but is the heartbeat of Highlanders’ midfield, he has always shone, but the best of him is coming out under Brito. With the last round of July matches set for the coming weekend, the duo has put themselves in contention for the PSL end of the month player’s accolade. Another player who has firmly put himself in contention for the July Player of the Month award is FC Platinum’s goalkeeper Wallace Magalane, who has nine consecutive clean sheets that have kept the Zvishavane side’s title hopes on track. Four of Magalane’s clean sheets are from matches played in July. – @ZililoR
