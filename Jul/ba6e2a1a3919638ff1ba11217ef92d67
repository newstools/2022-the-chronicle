DeMbare fans tore the nets and attempted to uproot the goalposts. The fence barricade was also damaged in the process. The Director of Housing and Community Services in its review on hiring out public facilities such as community halls and stadia gave a breakdown of the costs incurred. “Various contractors had been requested to assess the damage and generate quotations with a view to institute repair works. Quotations obtained so far had indicated that it would approximately cost US$3 092,67 to repair the goal posts and nets and the Mpilo End perimeter fence would cost around US$1 200. “This brought the total cost to repair the damages to US$4 312,67.  The repair cost would be offset using deposit against damages fee paid by the hirer as per the standard procedure. In the event that the deposit against damages was less than the actual cost, the hirer would be requested to pay a top up to offset the shortfall,” reads part of the review. Council noted that adequate preparations had been made before the match and it was unfortunate that acts of hooliganism occurred. “The two clubs had a large following and adequate preparations for the match were done by all concerned stakeholders. However, the match was marred by disturbances and vandalism of some parts of the stadium. The proceedings of the match had been characterised by intermittent stoppages as a result of missile throwing and vandalism. <img class="wp-image-616351 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-189.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-189.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-189-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders FC The situation deteriorated further when the home team Highlanders scored towards the end of the match. “Dynamos supporters, who had been housed at the Mpilo End, responded by pulling down the perimeter fence, invaded the pitch and attempted to pull down the goal post and at the same time tearing down the goal nets. Surprisingly, police officers who had been equipped with all the necessary equipment for crowd control did not react to the situation as expected,” reads the council report. — @innocentskizoe
