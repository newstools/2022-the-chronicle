WOMEN’S International Boxing Association (WIBA) intercontinental lightweight champion Monalisa ‘‘Queen of the Jungle’’ Sibanda is set to defend her title against Ugandan Small Valente Aciro on July 27 in Victoria Falls. The first Zimbabwean female boxer to turn pro was supposed to defend her belt in 2020 after winning the crown in 2019 against Kenyan Joyce Awino.  However, the bout was repeatedly deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the past two years when sport, especially contact sport, was effectively on suspension. Sibanda will be back in the ring later this month in a tournament promoted by Stalin Mau-Mau. The tournament was announced at a Press briefing in Harare yesterday afternoon, and Sibanda expressed confidence that she will win the bout. <img class="wp-image-596024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 “I am happy to be back in the ring again.

The tournament will spice up the WBC All-Africa officials training workshop and the African Boxing Union (ABU) state of preparedness conference in the resort city.
