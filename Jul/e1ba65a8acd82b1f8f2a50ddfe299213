The Chronicle Innocent Mujeri
Sometime next year, the country will again go to the polls to elect a President who will steer the country for the next five years. Election time is scary as there are chances that the electorate may be induced and convinced to elect someone who lacks people’s interests at heart. As we move towards 2023 harmonised general elections, a number of presidential hopefuls have emerged with the intention of wrestling the throne from President Mnangagwa. Among the presidential aspirants are well known puppets and political pretenders such as Nelson Chamisa, who clearly does not represent the indigenous people’s interests as he is a willing tool ready to be used by the West to further their imperialistic agenda in Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-487741 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Chamisa-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Chamisa-1-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Chamisa-1-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Nelson Chamisa The worst fear shared by progressive Zimbabweans, is when the unthinkable happens, and a puppet is elected as the president of this sacred country. Although chances are very slim that Chamisa will be the President of Zimbabwe in his lifetime, it is important for the people need to be enlightened on the dangers of electing a puppet president who is remote-controlled from Washington. As a way of a simple definition, a puppet presidency is a scenario where a person elected or selected, retains a title and is furnished with all the pomp of state but whom, in reality has no power. That power resides with powerful interests in the form of an individual or a state that controls every decision made by this person. That person essentially presides over a puppet state. It is not a secret that Chamisa is a puppet of the West. In fact, it is not only Chamisa who is a puppet of the West but the whole membership of the political grouping he purports to lead. To show that Chamisa has no interests of Zimbabweans at heart, he promised at a rally this year that if he is elected as President, he would immediately order the return of the former white settlers. “If you give me one week in office, you will see white people coming with money,” claimed Chamisa. Why white people? This shows that unlike President Mnangagwa who believes that the country is developed by its citizens, Chamisa unintelligently thinks that the prosperity of this country lies with the whites who would bring money to Zimbabwe if he is elected to power. To Chamisa, the Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo philosophy is just a political rhetoric, not a development war cry. It would then be suicidal and lack of foresight for Zimbabweans to cast their votes for Chamisa in the next plebiscite. Zimbabweans should know that casting their votes for Chamisa would be calling for the reversal of the gains of the liberation struggles. Voting for Chamisa would be akin to selling our birth right as Zimbabweans as we would automatically become a little province of America. That would mean losing our pride and sovereignty as a country. Zimbabweans should know the dangers of electing Chamisa, a puppet of the West, to be the country’s President. The calibre of Chamisa is born out of the Machiavellian machinations of men with dishonourable intentions. So from the jump, a nation is at a disadvantage if this type of a person is elected. A Government led by a puppet is seldom fraught with a vision or love for country; it proceeds from the greed and lust for power which consistently lies in a corrupt heart.  Therefore, it follows that a republic is at a major disadvantage if this informal system prevails. The people of this great nation should know that a puppet president is inextricably linked to the prevalence of crookedness. Economies that are afflicted by a high level of unscrupulousness which involves the misuse of power in the form of money or authority to achieve certain goals in illegal, dishonest or unfair ways are not capable of prospering as fully as those with a low level of corruption. Corrupted economies are not able to function properly because corruption prevents the natural laws of the economy from functioning freely. As a result, this occurrence in a nation’s political and economic operations causes its entire society to suffer. On this basis, the people seek to ensure that their country stays clear of this set-up. High prices for low quality, inefficiently allocated resources; uneven distribution of wealth; the low stimulus for innovation; a shadow economy and low foreign direct investment and trade are all cousins of corruption, which is in turn married to a puppet president. It is even more incumbent on Zimbabweans to be watchful of this political choreography since the nation is on the cusp of an oil and gas economy. Furthermore, besides being a puppet of the West, Chamisa is an eloquent liar, a visionless young man and an indecisive leader. A country like Zimbabwe does not need an inconsistent person like Chamisa as its president. Since he controversially assumed power in the MDC- T and later rechristened it Citizens Coalition for Change, Chamisa has failed to provide alternative ideas that can propel the country forward. His messages have been that of mocking the Government, praising whites or showering praises on himself. He has not uttered something meaningful except childish promises such as constructing an airport in each village. Zimbabweans should know that other countries that had a puppet as their president were reduced to ruins and the citizens were reduced to street beggars. Countries that were crooked by the West to dethrone their patriot leaders in favour of puppets have lived to regret, a good example being Libya. Libya violently removed President Muammar Gaddafi, a patriotic leader in favour of a puppet. <img class="wp-image-626236 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-29-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Muammar Gaddafi The results are an unending internal conflict, ruined cities and high cost of living. Surely as Zimbabweans, we do not want to go the same route. The only option to insulate ourselves from the selfish rule of puppets is to emphatically vote for President Mnangagwa next year. In the few years he has been the Head of State, President Mnangagwa has turned this country into a construction site. He has spearheaded the construction of roads, dams and factories. Under President Mnangagwa, a lot of employment opportunities have been created, especially in the agriculture, mining and construction sector. If we give him another Presidential mandate next year, he will surely turn this country into the Dubai of Africa. The choice is cut for us, either we choose a puppet as president and retrogress into stone age era or we elect President Mnangagwa and turn this country into a mini earthly paradise.
