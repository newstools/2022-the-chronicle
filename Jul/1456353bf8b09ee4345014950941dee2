PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has congratulated the Zimbabwe Moot Court team after it was crowned champions for beating The Netherlands in the final of the European Moot Court Championships held in Romania yesterday. It was an emotional moment when the team, drawn from four high schools — Dominican Convent, Peterhouse, Midlands Christian College and Arundel — wrote their fairytale and landed the top prize. In his congratulatory message, President Mnangagwa, who donated US$30 000 to the team before it left Harare last week, said the team had done the country proud. <img class="size-full wp-image-602851" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay “Another victory for the pride of Zimbabwe.

There were lots of sleepless evenings and early mornings and they were all worth it for this prize,” she said. Before their departure, the team was optimistic of coming out tops at the championships, and promised to do well to repay the support they got, including from President Mnangagwa who gave them US$30  000 to demonstrate his support for them. In May, the team was crowned world champions after winning the 2022 World Moot Court competition hosted virtually by the United States, resulting in them being invited to participate in the European Moot Competition. <img class="size-full wp-image-621817" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa A moot court simulates a real court where students are made to participate in the staged court proceedings that are related to a fictional dispute between parties. Mostly, moot courts are conducted in law schools where the students are expected to pursue their careers in the field of law as lawyers, arbitrators and judges; hence they are made to practise to be trained for the future along with development of the required skills.
