The Chronicle Leonard Ncube Victoria Falls THE sports sector contributes to socio-economic development, the transformation of lives and facilitates better lifestyles hence the Government is investing in it as it is key to efforts to turn Zimbabwe into an upper middle-income economy by 2030, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has said. VP Chiwenga said this while officially opening the ongoing World Boxing Council (WBC) All-Africa Officials Training and Grading Workshop and Africa Boxing Union (ABU) seminar here yesterday.

We are going to be pushing the issue of accommodation both for our visitors through construction of more hotels and lodges as well as facilities for sport, convention centres and more importantly construction of the Cricket Stadium here,” said VP Chiwenga. A boxing fan himself, VP Chiwenga said Victoria Falls should be a world sports destination. He said sport is a catalyst for socio-economic development and transforms lives while also building a healthy nation. “In this respect, may I underscore that sport tourism has become one of the fastest growing industries across the globe. Sport events, conferences, tournaments and workshops are now known to be important in attracting tourism hence it is important to build economies around tourism and sport. “I believe Victoria Falls can become a destination of choice when it comes to hosting such events. In view of the foregoing, I implore relevant departments and authorities to collaborate in developing sport facilities and continue to host workshops, tournaments and conferences,” said VP Chiwenga.  He said it is part of the Second Republic’s agenda to develop high quality sporting facilities in Victoria Falls, a city the Government wants to make its conference capital with five-star infrastructure. VP Chiwenga said Zimbabwe is known for its unique and refreshing hospitality and natural resources, He said sport has become a catalyst in the socio-economic growth of nations and has also become highly scientific hence the need to capacitate technical stakeholders involved in identification and development of sporting talent. “I wish to state that the Government of Zimbabwe is committed to developing sport in the country. As such, the Government has decentralised the ZBWCB function to ensure a footprint in every province thereby leaving no-one and no community behind. “Government has also invested considerably in this regard mostly in the area of capacity development of coaches and officials. We have now adopted a sports science approach so that the country can continuously churn out competent officers at all levels. This initiative will go a long way in positively transforming sport,” added the VP. He called for a paradigm shift to sport development and implored all sport stakeholders to exalt good governance in the administration of sport. <img class="wp-image-632137 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Minister-Kirsty-Coventry-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Minister-Kirsty-Coventry-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Minister-Kirsty-Coventry--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Kirsty Coventry The VP said while Africa is endowed with abundant boxing talent, the continent still lags behind other regions in terms of performance at the highest level in sport and other facets of society hence the need for a “soldier on” spirit. “As Africans we also need to strive to improve on collaboration among ourselves in addition to focusing on governance issues,” said VP Chiwenga. He said the boxing seminar is a unique opportunity to prove Zimbabwe as a safe world tourism destination fit to host international conventions and tournaments. <img class="size-full wp-image-607072" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Richard Moyo The VP commended Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kirsty Coventry for her contribution to sports in the country and challenged athletes to emulate those that have raised the country’s flag higher.
