The recovery rate was 96 percent with 35 active cases recorded. In response to questions, Bulawayo provincial medical director Dr Maphios Siamuchembu said besides the decrease the vaccination programme has experienced high staff turnover hence the need for recruitment of more healthcare workers to man health institutions and static centres. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623446 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-30.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-30.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-30-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said numbers for vaccinated residents keep fluctuating which is not good as efforts are being made to ensure that Bulawayo and Zimbabwe reach herd immunity. At least 569 010 residents should be fully vaccinated for Bulawayo to achieve herd immunity. “Generally, the overall number of provincial cases decreased during the week under review, with 15 new cases recorded compared to 38 new cases the previous week. This represents a 61 percent decrease. An average of two new cases was reported per day, compared to five new cases per day the previous week,” said Dr Siamuchembu. “The total number of people that received the first and second doses of Covid-19 vaccines during the week under review was 368 and 499 respectively.  “The number of people who received the first and second dose of Covid-19 vaccines decreased during the week under review compared to the number (636 and 817 respectively) in the previous week. According to the Ministry of Health and Child Care National Daily Situational Reports for 23 June  2022 to 29 June 2022, the overall provincial coverage  for the first dose was at 63,6 percent and second dose was at 54 percent during the week under review.” -@thamamoe
