He said the city which used to be the country’s industrial hub, also has a rich history and strong heritage-based products that have positive bearing for tourism development, traditional food value chain, unique fashion and design and entertainment platforms.  “Having traditional food, music, clothing, poems and literature will also help in developing our own township tourism,” he said. Mr Moyo, who was part of participants who attended the recent Winter Affair event for start-up businesses that was hosted by Diamond Berry Enterprises under the theme: ‘Reforming the Entrepreneurial Culture’, said local entrepreneurs must embrace technology to process and package traditional food products as well as enhance quality standards to entice the market and tap into exports. He said commercialising heritage and cultural products will help the city and the nation to meet Vision 2030 ideals. Mr Moyo said indigenous knowledge systems could also be exploited to develop unique products, which will be sold to diverse markets. <img class="wp-image-612391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 “Following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic people turned to umsuzwane/zumbane and that is indigenous knowledge, which can be used to produce our own traditional medicines,” he said. Diamond Berry managing director Mr Nhlanhla Dabengwa said Bulawayo, which is anchored on arts and creativity has the potential to boost employment and tourism. “Very few platforms exist to support this rich raw product, which can be developed across the value chains to build an industry that can boost employment, tourism and social financial inclusion,” said Mr Dabengwa. — @SikhulekelaniM1.
