ZIFA Southern Region insist the Wafa Wafa knockout competition has not died a natural death as the final of what was meant to be a pre-season tournament will be played before the end of the present campaign. The final, pitting Hwange FC and Arenel FC was meant to be played months ago, but the association kept postponing it leading to questions being raised on the reasons behind the delays in hosting the final which is meant for the Colliery Stadium. <img class="wp-image-607948 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Colliery Stadium Speaking to the Siqalo podcast Zifa board member Tizirayi Luphahla said they were looking for new sponsors for the competition. “It’s a topical issue. When we got the nod to start our league we just needed to have a test run of the teams. So, we came up with the Wafa Wafa knockout competition which we hosted successfully with the final pitting Hwange and Arenel. <img class="alignnone wp-image-581820 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/wafa-wafa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/wafa-wafa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/wafa-wafa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We had a sponsor, who was bankrolling the cup, but because of financial constraints one of our sponsors had difficulties but mark my words that the final will take place. “I can assure you it will be played in Hwange before the end of the season, it has not died a natural death. The initial sponsor had made an offer but since he is not coming forth we have engaged some other sponsors so that we have the final played,” said Luphahla.  The competition marked the return of football in the lower league after a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19 and was meant to get teams ready for the championship race which began in December last year. Winners of the competition, whose sponsor was never announced, were meant to get US$3 000, with losing finalists going home with US$2 000. Teams that were knocked out in the semi-finals were each meant to pocket US$1 500, while quarter-finalists were meant to get US$500. There was no prize money for teams that were knocked out in the first round. — @innocentskizoe
