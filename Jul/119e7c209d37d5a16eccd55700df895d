THE Matabeleland Cultural Awards (MCA) is in need of help to successfully host its fourth edition slated for October 30 at Amakhosi Township Square. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629182" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-203.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-203.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-203-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The awards, established in 2019 have been an annual fixture that celebrates cultural diversity. MCA’s chief executive Philani Ncube said the organisation is facing challenges in hosting the event and needs support. “We’re appealing for corporate and individual sponsorship for our upcoming awards as our coffers are running dry. We’re in dire straits and the successful hosting of these awards hinges on the corporate world pitching in with sponsorships,” he said.  The MCA also extended a call to creatives to submit works for adjudication for the awards. To enter, people are expected to fill in nomination forms that are available on the MCA Facebook page. Entries that opened on July 1 are set to close on October 1. Creatives involved in traditional song and dance, carving, traditional regalia design, traditional food, and indigenous language authors fit the bill for nominations. Also, rural hut painters, weavers, potters, and poets among others have been invited to submit their work for nomination. The awards seek to honour artistes in Matabeleland for their achievements in the region as well as uplift cultural players to ensure continuity and preservation of local culture for future generations. <img class="wp-image-629185 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-204.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-204.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-204-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Umthwentwe International Cultural Expo MCA organisers were also behind Umthwentwe International Cultural Expo that took place last month where cultural players from the Matabeleland region gathered at Cont Mhlanga’s Amakhosi Township Square. – @eMKlass_49
