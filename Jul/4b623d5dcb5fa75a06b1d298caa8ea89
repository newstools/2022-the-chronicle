THE business community in Kwekwe has vowed to defy sanctions through taking advantage of the Government’s renewed doing business reform agenda, which is creating an environment that supports new investments while opening up opportunities for existing entities. Speaking during an interactive business meeting with President Mnangagwa in Kwekwe on Friday, chairperson of the Kwekwe Business Community, Mr Thakor Patel, said the Second Republic has created a conducive environment for business through policy reforms and infrastructure development. “We have been cut off from finance by the western countries but that didn’t stop our businesses from thriving,” he said. “This is a true sign of visionary leadership by His Excellency that has seen business continue to thrive despite sanctions. This is really appreciated.”  Mr Patel urged fellow business operators to take advantage of the conducive environment created by the Second Republic and contribute to economic transformation. “Let’s take advantage of the conducive environment created by His Excellency. The Government has made available loans from the banks, land for agriculture and mining as well as a conducive environment for business. “Let’s not complain too much about the Government but instead find solutions to address them and move on,” said Mr Patel. “The `President has ensured that the country is self-food sufficient through the Pfumvudza/Intwasa Programme. On top of that there are projects like Lake Gwayi-Shangani, Mbudzi Roundabout, Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme, as well as irrigation systems.” Business Economic Empowerment Forum (BEEF) president, Dr Solomon Matsa, said President Mnangagwa’s vision was being hampered by some Government workers who sleep on duty. <img class="wp-image-602913 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-38-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-38-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-38-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Intwasa “Our President is working day in day out to come up with policies and he has succeeded in creating a conducive environment for business,” he said. “The only problem is that there are some people within Government structures who are corrupt and hinder the implementation of President Mnangagwa’s vision. “We urge the Government to look at such people and possibly be fired as they are hampering development.”
Dendairy director, Mr Darren Coetzee, decried the 200 percent interest rates adopted by the Central bank saying this was making it difficult to borrow money. “We understand with what has been happening in the market recently, you had to increase interest rates. But it has become a real struggle for the manufacturing industry as we have to pay our farmers within seven days and pay for our suppliers. Not being able to borrow money has been a real struggle,” said Mr Coetzee. Enock Ncube who spoke on behalf of Youth in Business applauded the Government for availing land for the youths for various projects and the mining sector as well. In his response, President Mnangagwa, castigated corrupt business operations and warned that his Government will not tolerate any adverse commercial behaviour that frustrates consumers. <img class="wp-image-626458 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-48-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-48-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-48-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa He went on to highlight several milestones that his administration has achieved since coming into power in 2017 and assured delegates that Zimbabwe was poised for a brighter future. “When we said Zimbabwe is open for business, we forgot to mention that it was closed for mischief. There are mischievous criminals who are now destabilising the economy especially within banks, those are the people we were targeting when we increased interest rates,” said the President. “Unfortunately, you will have to suffer but only for a while as we put this situation under control.” The meeting was organised by the Zanu PF Kwekwe Central District (Cell 7), which is largely dominated by the Indian community. The branch was formulated by President Mnangagwa in 1982 during his tenure as Kwekwe Central legislator and Mr Patel once served as his chairperson.
