HIGHLANDERS want to build on their perfect start to the second-half of the season by ending a 29-match winless streak out of Bulawayo when they take on Ngezi Platinum Stars on Sunday. Portuguese coach Baltermar Brito, who replaced Mandla Mpofu, kicked off his Bosso account with a hard-fought 3-2 win over Black Rhinos on a cold and wet Sunday afternoon at Barbourfields Stadium. It was a perfect start for the veteran gaffer, who introduced a new playing style, which saw wingers Rahman Kutsanzira and Gofrey Makaruse re-assigned to wingbacks; a system vice-captain Peter Muduhwa says makes them “play the ball more” than they did in the past. <img class="wp-image-607699 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stanley Ngala Never mind that Bosso survived a scare against Rhinos, as they narrowly won the game, which gave Brito maximum points against a side that beat them 2-0 in the reverse fixture during the first-half of the season. That their two strikers, Stanley Ngala and Lynoth Chikuhwa, were on target, with the latter grabbing a brace, ignited hope in the Highlanders’ family that maybe Brito had brought the magic for the goal-shy forwards. Heading to Ngezi, Muduhwa says their focus is on ending the barren run outside the city. “It hasn’t been difficult adapting to the demands of the new coach. It has been easy to adapt to the play that the coach wants because of the way he has taught us. We’re playing more of the ball and we’ve always been confident with the ball. <img class="wp-image-622909 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-21-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Baltermar Brito “As we go to Ngezi, we’re looking forward to a positive result. We’re looking forward to the first away win because we’ve gone for long without it. If we manage to get that away win, I’m sure that we will grow in confidence going forward,” said Muduhwa. Highlanders’ last league win outside Bulawayo was on July 22, 2018, when they pipped Triangle United 1-0 at Gibbo Stadium. This season Highlanders have played seven matches outside Bulawayo and lost three times to Black Rhinos (2-0), Manica Diamonds (1-0) and 3-0 that was awarded to FC Platinum for the abandoned game at Mandava Stadium due to crowd trouble. The April 23 game was abandoned with the scoreline at 1-1. Bosso have drawn four times out of Bulawayo against Tenex (0-0), Caps United (1-1), Triangle United (0-0) and ZPC Kariba (0-0). <img class="wp-image-599631 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu This means from a possible 21 points, Highlanders only managed four points outside the city and new coach Brito is seeking to change their fortunes. Besides trying to end their lengthy winless run on the highway, Highlanders have won only once at Baobab Stadium in five previous visits. That victory came in 2016 when they dismissed Ngezi 4-1.  In 2017, Bosso lost 3-0 at Baobab and in 2018 they were edged 1-0, while in 2019 they forced a 1-1 draw. Highlanders are eighth on the log table with 26 points, two points behind Ngezi, who are sixth. Bosso should expect a tough game, as their opponents declared their intentions of a top-four finish following their 3-0 win against Bulawayo City at Barbourfields Stadium last Saturday. Victory for Highlanders will see them leapfrogging Ngezi. — @ZililoR
