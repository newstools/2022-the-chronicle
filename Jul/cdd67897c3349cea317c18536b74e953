The Chronicle ETERNAL LIFE BROUGHT US AGELESSNESS
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my  day: and he saw it, and was glad. Then  said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am (John 8:56-58). WITH this singular statement — “Before  Abraham was, I AM”—our Lord Jesus declared His agelessness. <img class="alignnone wp-image-627670 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Agelessness refers to a life of endless development, where you grow without getting old. It’s an endless, incorruptible, and indestructible life. When you were born again, you received the same eternal life as Jesus and were brought into agelessness.  Hallelujah! Speaking about eternal life, John declared: “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested unto us” (1 John 1:1-2).  The purpose for which it was manifested was so that we might have and live the same life. As you study the Scriptures and see such truths, you see your true reflection and can tell what your life ought to be. Now that you’re born again, you’ve been born into God’s realm, into eternity! To live in the Word of God, and in Christ, is to live in eternity. That’s the life you’ve got. You’re in Christ; that’s your new environment. You’re not of this world. So, start living your ageless life. CONFESSION
I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus and I have the life of God in me. My spirit, soul and body are vitalised through and through by the power and effect of righteousness and the fullness of the God-life that I’ve received through the Gospel. I’m walking in the reality of my divine heritage in Christ, conscious of His grace and awesome presence in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
