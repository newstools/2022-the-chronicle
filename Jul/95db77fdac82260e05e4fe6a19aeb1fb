The Chronicle And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles… (Judges 6:13). IN life, there’re people who ask the wrong questions and make the wrong requests. There’s just something about them that makes them ask the wrong questions every time they have an opportunity. But you can ask the right questions. There’re good questions that guide you to useful answers. Until you learn to ask the right questions, you won’t find meaningful answers that’ll propel you forward. <img class="wp-image-626908 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> sickness God wants you to ask the right questions. At a time when Israel was being oppressed by another nation, an angel appeared to Gideon and greeted, “The Lord is with you, mighty man of valour.” Gideon replied, “Why do you call me a mighty man of valour? If God is with us, where are all His miracles?” This was a good question. If God was with them, then their lives ought not to be ordinary. <img class="wp-image-626905 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-31-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Olympics Have you ever watched the Olympics or some other sporting event on TV and wondered at the sportsmen who seemed to have superhuman abilities? You most likely found them amazing because you knew you couldn’t do some of the things they were doing. Or have you ever been blown away by the level of intelligence of a genius? What about you? Who says you can’t be more extraordinary than these people? When are you going to say like Gideon: “If God is with me, then my life cannot be ordinary!” And then you start asking the right questions.
God gave Solomon wisdom, and the Bible says he was wiser than all men. So, there was a time in this world when one man was wiser than all men, and he wasn’t Jesus. Why can’t that be you? Why can’t you be wiser than all the people in your city? Who says you can’t?  Is there some sickness or disease troubling your body? If you’ve received the Holy Spirit, then you need to ask the question: “Should I still be sick with the Holy Spirit living in me?” Not only should you ask this question, you must answer it. Take a hold of your Bible and meditate on the verse that says, “And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you” (Romans 8:11 NIV). Before long, the power of the Spirit will course through your body and produce results. Put this to work today. PRAYER
Dear Father, thank you for your wisdom that’s resident within me. Your Word has made me wise and brought me into a place of excellence, success, victory and abundance. I’m inspired by your Word to think the right thoughts, speak the right words, ask the right questions, and receive the results of the Word in my life today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
