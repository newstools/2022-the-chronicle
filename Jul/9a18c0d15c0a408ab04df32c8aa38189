ZimVac plays a significant role in fulfilling commitment six of the Food and Nutrition Security Policy of 2012, in which the Government is committed to ensuring a national integrated Food and Nutrition Security Information System that provides timely and reliable information on the food and nutrition security situation and the effectiveness of programmes and informs decision-making. Primary data collection of this year’s report took place from 11 to 23 May 2022. “With regards to addressing the challenge of the 16,2 percent of children who were out of school at the time of the survey, Government through the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare is implementing the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM) programme which is targeting 1.5million children.” “In order to ensure full attendance by learners, the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is implementing the policy which prohibits the sending away of children for non-payment of school fees. All school heads have been mandated with the responsibility of ensuring its implementation. This is in light of the 51,8 percent of children who were reported to have been turned away from school during the first term of 2022 due to non-payment of school fees,” reads the report. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The ZimVac 2022 report further states that 69 percent of rural households had access to primary schools  within a radius of five kilometres while 26 percent had access to a primary school within a five-to-10-kilometre radius.
