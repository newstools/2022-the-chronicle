So far, he is the only player from our last year squad who has parted ways with the club. We wish him all the best in his new endeavors,” said Moyo. Chronicle Sport however has it on good authority that Siamalonga, a club junior product, is no longer a Highlanders player although it’s not yet clear if he leaves as a free agent or he has been loaned out, as has been the club norm with its junior products.
