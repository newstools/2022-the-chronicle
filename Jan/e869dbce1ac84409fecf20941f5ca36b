FORMER Chevrons pace bowler Edward Rainsford has been on commentary duty for the second BetWay Test match between South Africa and India at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Proteas won the second Test match by seven wickets on Thursday to level the series 1-1. Proteas’ skipper Dean Elgar played a captain’s knock, scoring a valiant 96 not out to earn a man-of-the-match accolade in the process. India was in commanding form in the first Test match registering a comfortable 113-run win in Centurion. Together with former Proteas international Alviro Nathan Petersen and Udo Carelse, the former Chevrons’ bowler was on commentary and punditry duty for the South African Broadcasting Corporation.
