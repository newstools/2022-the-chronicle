LOCAL Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo has appointed Mr Ndeya Nyede (41) as the new district development co-ordinator (DDC) for Gweru District with immediate effect. He takes over from Mr Jorum Chimedza, who was transferred to Mvuma District to replace Mr Vafias Hlabati, who was transferred to Mberengwa District. Midlands secretary for provincial affairs and devolution Mr Abiot Maronge confirmed that there had been reshuffling of DDCs in the province, adding that this was normal. Mr Nyede said his vision is to spearhead development of the district through implementation of the Second Republic’s National Development Strategy 1 as the country moves towards an upper-middle income economy by 2030. “This is a welcome development for me as I serve my Government. I will work together with other DDCs towards achieving the country’s movement towards an upper-middle income economy by 2030,” he said. “We currently have outstanding projects such as the road treatment project at Vungu RDC. We have already purchased a tipper truck for road maintenance.” Mr Nyede is a holder of a Public Administration degree from the University of Zimbabwe. He has previously worked as an acting DDC in Zaka and Chiredzi in Masvingo Province before being transferred to Mberengwa District, which he served until his latest transfer to Gweru District.
