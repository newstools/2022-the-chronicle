COMEDIAN and actor Carl Joshua Ncube is contemplating running a Busking Corner in the city as a way of promoting local artistes. Busking is basically a form of art where artistes perform on the street, either to promote themselves or to make a living through acquiring donations for their performances from the public. The busking corner is set to be situated at Carne Casa restaurant in Bulawayo, an establishment that Carl Josh is managing. Posting on his Facebook account, the comedian said there is a need for artistes to adapt to busking in order to upscale their careers. “Being an artiste and remembering how I started and strategised the trajectory of my career, I have devised a plan to introduce artistes to my methods through a concept called Buskers Corner. “This is designed at introducing street performances to our Street Corner at Carne Casa and generate a celebratory atmosphere, but in the background, develop artistes from our street corner to the world,” he said. Carl Josh said local artistes should see how busking has managed to lead to breakthroughs for many artistes with famous buskers in the world including Glen Hansard, Passenger, Rod Stewart, Tracy Chapman, Jewel, Damien Rice, Pierce Brosnan and Ed Sheeran. “Buskers nowadays have found clever ways to use street performances and social media to get good traction and grow their careers and followers,” he said. Speaking to Chronicle Showbiz, Carl Josh said local artistes should take advantage of the initiative. “We want to encourage artistes to use our corner to perform and I’ll help them to try and improve their business models. Busking is a form of street performance, unplanned, unscheduled and not advertised,” he said. Carl Josh said they are now in the process of scouting for artistes who fit into their criteria. – @mthabisi_mthire.
