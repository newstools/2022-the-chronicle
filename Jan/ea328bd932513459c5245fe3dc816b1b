Mine is a plea to be afforded the opportunity to serve the institution to the best of my ability. Unity of purpose is my motto, it’s not me but us, we have more that unites us than divide us. Your vote mandates me to serve you. I kindly ask your Chapter to vote and support me in my quest to serve you,” Moyo wrote as he seeks to take over from Donald Ndebele who is not eligible to stand for election. Barring any late entrants for the post, Moyo will face off against South African based Pastor, Busani Mthombeni. The Highlanders elections will be held on February 6, a week after the club’s annual general meeting.
