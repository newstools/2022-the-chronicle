It said the month-on-month food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation rate stood at 6,79 percent in January 2022, gaining 0,57 percentage points on the December 2021 rate of 6,22 percent.

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has blamed widening exchange rate premiums on the alternative market stoking inflation, which has in turn fuelled increases in prices of goods and services since July 2022. Economists believe three key factors have driven the fast increase in inflation in Zimbabwe and these include general rise in global inflation, growth in money supply and the widening parallel market rate. Zimbabwe’s inflation had been on a rapid decline for most of last year, touching a low of 56 percent last July from a post dollarisation record of 837,5 percent 12 months earlier. The country has battled sharp increases in inflation, the second time within two decades since scrapping a US dollar-based currency regime adopted in 2009 in February 2019. – @KazungaOliver.
