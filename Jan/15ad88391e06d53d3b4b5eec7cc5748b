The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief
SHURUGWI district lies in the mineral-rich geological belt commonly referred to as the Great Dyke that cuts through the Midlands and spread its tentacles as if to gift the province with its rich resources. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-587152" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-6-copy-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-6-copy-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-6-copy-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The belt also has fertile soils that are quite ideal for agriculture. The district has therefore been experiencing a lot of land-use and land-cover changes in recent years following the Government’s successful land reform programme that was aimed at reversing disparities in land distribution between whites and blacks. <img class="size-full wp-image-587151" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-7-copy-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-7-copy-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-7-copy-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Shurugwi North MP Cde Robson Nyathi The Great Dyke, which is up to 12 km wide and about 550 km long, consists of several precious minerals which include gold, silver, chromium, platinum, and nickel. These important minerals make Shurugwi the hub of mining in the Midlands province and the country as a whole. The district is therefore among other areas synonymous with minerals that push national development goals. Ferrochrome giants Zimasco and ZimAlloys are some of the companies that established themselves in the province as a result of the mining activities. Zimasco is largely credited for setting up most of the infrastructure in the area when it started exploiting chrome deposits in the 1960s. However, the demise of the giant chromite mining concern, the biggest employer in Shurugwi and the mainstay of the town’s economy brought the small mining town to a standstill. The town almost resembled a ghost town until the arrival of Anglo-Platinum concern Unki Mine. Shurugwi became home to Unki Mine which exploits one of the largest platinum reserves in Zimbabwe having estimated reserves of 34 millions ounce of the mineral. The mine produces around 64 000 ounces of platinum yearly. The giant has made huge strides in promoting infrastructure growth in the mining town pouring over $22 million in social corporate responsibility programmes. Their biggest investment thus far has been the Impali Housing Project where the mining giant is constructing about 1 000 houses for its workforce and other supporting infrastructure at a cost of $80 million. Shurugwi South MP Cde Edmond Mkaratigwa said the district prides itself in being one of the mineral rich areas in Zimbabwe whose attractiveness in terms of investment was only natural. He said Shurugwi was like a belly that carries many minerals. “These minerals have led to the opening of mining companies, both large and small. These are key in enhancing livelihoods which basically fall in the socio-economic developmental aspects of the people broadly, the taxes contribute to the national fiscus and broader national objectives enunciated in the National Development Strategy 1,” he said. Cde Mkaratigwa said Shurugwi was also central with regards to chrome, platinum and gold among other minerals, which were critical for the country’s geo-strategic importance. “Shurugwi churns out minerals through individuals, groups and corporations. These create a lot of job opportunities thereby reducing the rate of unemployment and contributes to national development through taxes, development of infrastructure and other benefits that comes with the socio-economic activities brought by mineral endowments in the district,” he said. Shurugwi District Development Coordinator (DDC) Mr Romeo Shangwa said the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) economic blueprint covering the period 2021 to 2025, aims to drive the beneficiation of minerals during its five-year period in order to enhance socio-economic development. “Shurugwi plays a pivotal role in the economic development of the country as it has such important minerals as platinum and gold which drive economic growth. The mining sector plays a very significant role in the development of the country as it has continued to bring much needed foreign currency into the country apart from investment,” he said. Mr Shangwa said besides the big Unki Mine there were local players who got opportunities from the Second Republic to start business ventures who were now developing the town. “Following the demise of companies such as Zimasco, we have seen the emergence of local players in mining and construction industries much to the benefit of locals who are getting employed. I would say Shurugwi is changing for the best,” he said. He said indigenous players such as Pote Holdings, Vital Trading and Inductoserve were leading in the construction of state-of-the-art infrastructure in Shurugwi. There are also small-scale miners who are instrumental in the development of Shurugwi and the country at large who include Mr Nicholas Gara and Mr Marufu Sithole. Mr Gara under Nichrut Investments has a number of mining claims and gold mills in Shurugwi, while Mr Sithole is the director of Chimona Mining Company, which also has gold claims, gold mills and a quarry claim in the mining town. Mr Sithole has been expanding his mining interests with the latest addition being a granite claim. He has also secured old mining shafts in the Wanderers area of Shurugwi left by Germans which had been taken over by artisanal miners who were posing environmental and safety dangers in the area due to their unregulated activities. Shurugwi is also home to the scenic Fernie Creek Pass popularly known as Boterekwa. Unfortunately, the natural scenic state of freshwater streams and diverse plant and bird species have also been affected by water pollution and land degradation as trees and vegetation in the valley are now covered by layers of fine dust and heaps of soil dug by gold panners. The Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution Larry Mavima said there was a need to expedite the rehabilitation and dualisation of Boterekwa road to spur development in the district and the country at large. He said the Boterekwa escarpment road which was an international passage for trade and tourism in Shurugwi was undergoing a US$7 million facelift after the Government approved proposed dualisation designs. The dualisation of the eight-kilometre descent has started in earnest bringing relief to motorists. Built several decades ago by Italian craftsmen, the breath-taking road link has stood the test of time almost outliving its lifespan which prompted the Government to repair it as it was now showing signs of its tiredness with drivers struggling to manoeuvre safely thereby contributing to road carnage. Chief Nhema said Shurugwi had the potential to grow into a city because of its minerals. Shurugwi North MP Cde Robson Nyathi said they have taken advantage of the minerals around the district and have embraced the new dispensation’s vision to create a conducive environment for investors. “That’s why Shurugwi is growing very fast. This means an increase in employment, improved standard of living for our people, growth of our national GDP and finally looking forward to achieving Vision 2030,” he said.
