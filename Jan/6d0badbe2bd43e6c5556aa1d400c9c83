WANTAWAY Chicken Inn midfielder George Majika has taken his case to the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe in a bid to solve the impasse with the Bulawayo club. The midfielder wants to join Highlanders, but has been told that he can’t move for free as he still has a contract with the Gamecocks. Majika insists his contract ran out at the end of last month. Sources said the player no longer wants to play for Chicken Inn, but wants to join the black and white family which is on a massive player recruitment exercise in a bid to turn around the club’s fortunes once league games resume next month. Fuz secretary general and spokesperson Thomas Sweswe confirmed to Chronicle Sport yesterday that Majika approached them last week and they advised him to go back to his employer and try to reach an amicable solution. “We always encourage our members to first engage their employers before they come to us, so we advised him to speak with his club. We are still waiting to hear from him since last week after he approached us,” said Sweswe. Meanwhile, Highlanders have agreed terms with FC Platinum forward Stanley Ngala and the Bulawayo giants are now in talks with Pure Platinum Play for a clearance letter. “Ngala is now technically a Bosso player, he has agreed personal terms and everything else. Highlanders are now engaging FC Platinum for a clearance letter, but otherwise it’s a done deal,” said a source close to the developments. Ngala is one of five players that Bosso wanted, with Ngala’s teammate Silas Songani being on the wish list too, but Songani’s deal seems to have fallen through after attracting interest from an Icelandic second tier team. Also on the shopping list was Bulawayo Chiefs captain Malvin Mkolo and Triangle United goalkeeper Ralph Pitisi. There are also reports that former captain Rahman Kutsanzira is keen on returning to Highlanders.
