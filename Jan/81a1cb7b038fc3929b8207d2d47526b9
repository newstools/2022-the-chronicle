Celebrate Africa Music Competition, a talent search for traditional instruments players and singers is calling for entries for its second edition. The competition that was supposed to be held late last year will be held this month with organisers extending their invitation to artistes for auditions that will be held from the 10th to the 16th of this month. The closing date for registration is on Saturday. CEO of Celebrate Africa Music Competition, Blessing “Bled” Chimanga said the competition uniquely focuses on musicians who play traditional African instruments and accompany themselves by singing in an African language as he shed light on the criteria of selection. <img class="wp-image-584609 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Blessing-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Blessing-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Blessing-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Blessing Chimanga, CEO of Celebrate Africa Music Competition “Season 1 of the competition held in 2020 had over 300 participants drawn from Bulawayo, Gweru and Harare. This time, we’ll just have 150 from across three cities. “We’ve put Mutare in place of Gweru and we’re calling on all artistes who’re able to sing in an African language and are able to play an African instrument to come through. Registration is free,” he said. Bled also highlighted they will be having 50 participants per city with the African instruments being alluded to being the mbira, marimba, ngoma, chipendani and the acoustic guitar among others. Bled said only artistes aged between 16 and 30 years are eligible to enter the competition. The first round of auditions will be on January 10 in Harare followed by Mutare auditions on the following day. Bulawayo will have its auditions on January 12. The second round of auditions will see participants converging in Harare on January 14 before the curtain comes down with the finale in Harare on January 16. For the winner(s) exploits, they will cash in US$300 in cash, a studio recording contract, a year’s scholarship programme with Music Crossroads Zimbabwe and one-year mentorship and management programme with Dreams Trust. Bled said the winner’s prize is driven towards the advancement of perfecting their instrument-playing techniques and building a career. “What makes this competition different from the rest is the main focus on African music instruments, and for young musicians to learn to believe in their true identity and sound. “Our main focus is on upholding our cultural sound and creating a product that will be a model for cultural heritage for generations to come. “Our culture, instruments, and languages are special but it seems that as the younger generation we haven’t been given enough creative material that can make us proud of who we are and our real African identity.” Last month, Celebrate Africa Music Competition hosted online concerts to end the year with an amazing finale on December 30. Together with partners, Alliance Francaise de Harare, The European Union Delegation and Culture Fund, Celebrate Africa Music Competition organised online Facebook shows to celebrate Zimbabwe’s traditional music. The online shows had the likes of last edition’s winners Mudepu Brothers together with Taffie, Simanga, Victor Msara and Lady Tshawe performing. — @eMKlass_49
