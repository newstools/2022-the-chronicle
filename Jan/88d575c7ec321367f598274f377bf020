TWO men who had been on the run after allegedly stabbing to death a 39- year- old man have been arrested. The body was discovered in a bushy area near Alarm 3 Mine compound in Kwekwe on January 1. Police have since launched a manhunt for three more suspects in connection with the murder of John Gomba of Alarm 3 Mine compound in Kwekwe. Midlands Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the fatal stabbing of Gomba on New Year’s day. He said following the fatal stabbing, investigations by the police led to the arrest of two Kwekwe men who are assisting the police with investigations while a manhunt for three more suspects is underway. Insp Mahoko said it is believed that Gomba bled to death after he was stabbed. “I can confirm that we are investigating a matter of murder which happened on New Year’s day at Alarm 3 compound in Kwekwe. It is believed that Gomba bled to death from the stab wounds after the fatal stabbing by two men from Kwekwe identified as Munashe Mpofu (18) and Chahiya Makore (23),” said Insp Mahoko. He said police are keen to interview Isaac Gomba (relation with the deceased not established), Clever Zananda and Irvine Maodzeka also from Alarm 3 compound in Kwekwe in connection with the murder case. Insp Mahoko appealed to members of the public who might have information pertaining to the three suspects to approach any nearest police station. “We appeal for more information so that the outstanding suspects are arrested so that they are taken to court. The police are also appealing to members of the public not to take the law into their own hands. It’s sad that every day we continue receiving murder cases which can be avoided,” he said.
