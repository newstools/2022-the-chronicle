HWANGE FC and Arenel Movers will clash in the final of the Zifa Southern Region Division One Wafa Wafa knockout competition after both sides registered semi-final wins over Bosso 90 and Indlovu Iyanyathela respectively. Both semi-final matches were played in front of a good crowd at White City Stadium yesterday. Experience prevailed over youth, as Hwange saw off the challenge of a spirited Bosso 90 outfit. The visitors won the game 1-0 courtesy of a strike from veteran midfielder Thabani Goredema. The Bosso 90 side’s average age is 19, but they played like an experienced lot. In their ranks, Hwange had the likes of veterans Felix Chindungwe, Canaan Nkomo, Goredema and Nedrick Madeya. “We were disjointed in the middle of the park, but this is a cup game and the objective is always to win. We are happy that we have won playing a young side which is full of running. We came to win and we managed to do just that. We need to work because our opponents (in the final) have a bit more experience, so we have work to do,” said Hwange coach Bongani Mafu. In the other semi-final Arenel beat Indlovu Iyanyathela 6-5 on penalties after the two sides played to a goalless draw in regulation time. Arenel coach Kudzayi Mhandire said they now have their eyes on the title. “We have not got to this stage by chance. Obviously at this stage we want to win the competition. We have done well up to this stage. If you look at it, we are the only side that has not conceded. I feel we have a chance to win it,” he said. Winners of the pre-season competition will cash in US$3 000, with the losing finalists going home with US$2 000.
Bosso 90 and Indlovu Iyanyathela will each pocket US$1 500, while teams that lost in the quarter-finals will be rewarded with US$500. There is no prize money for teams knocked out in the first-round. – @innocentskizoe
