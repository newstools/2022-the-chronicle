THE Zimbabwe Music Awards (Zima) expected to be held in the capital on February 19 will be staged in a hybrid setup where there will be live-streaming and physical attendance. The biggest music awards showcase in the country revealed its nominees last week and Nutty O proved that he was unstoppable as he led the pack. Event organisers said the awards ceremony will be held under the theme “Rhythm, Roots and Cultural Diversity”. All eyes will be on the high-flying Nutty O whose Mustard Seed album saw him get seven nominations. The album contains songs such as Handipere Power and Safe that are doing well on radio charts. His collaboration with Demarco on the song Ndiwe has also made him a crowd favourite. Nutty O was followed closely by Freeman with six nominations with Roki bouncing back to the awards sphere with five nominations. DJ Zandimaz is tied on four nominations with Janet Manyowa while Tamy Moyo is tied on three nominations with fast rising D.T BiO Mudimba who surprised many by coming out tops in the Radio Zimbabwe Top 50 2021 chart. Hip-hop duo Crisswiss and The Dot continue to find their spot at awards as they are nominated in the Best Group/Duo category. Hard work has finally paid for Ma9Nine and Sikhosana as they made their debut at Zima with Ma9Nine nominated in the Best Zimdancehall category with Sikhosana being nominated in the Best Traditional category. <img class="size-full wp-image-588100" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Sikhosana.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Sikhosana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Sikhosana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sikhosana The Matabeleland region is highly represented by artistes that include Mawiza, Leslie Kampila, MUSE, Mamozi, Qeqe, Clement Magwaza, Madlela Skhobokhobo, Insimbi Zezhwane, Martin and Ndolwane Super Sounds, Amaqaqa and Sunduza. <img class="wp-image-588098 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Qeqe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Qeqe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Qeqe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Qeqe  Below is a full list of Zima 2022 nominees: Best Group/Duo Breeze Music Criss Wis And The Dot Fusion 5 Mangwiro Vabati Vajehova Best Newcomer D.t Bio Mudimba Feli Nandi Kae Chaps Shashl Best Album Freeman Hkd -Robbery Nutty O – Mustard Seed Nyasha David – Songs Of David Tamy Moyo – Bvudzijena Zimdancehall Enzo Ishall Freeman Hkd Ma9nine Nutty O Tocky Vibesbest Sungura D.t Bio Mudimba Mukoma Panga Romeo Gasa Shamblo Best Afropop Exq Gemma Griffiths Herman Tamy Moyo Best Hiphop Dough Major M.u.s.e Probeats R.
