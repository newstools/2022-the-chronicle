ABANDONED, neglected, rejected, deserted, forsaken, unused, disused, idle, jilted, isolated – these synonyms all describe Matopo Sailing Club, one of the country’s oldest leisure centres. At least that’s how they described it, until last weekend when Modern Magnet Investments in partnership with ZimParks, 3D Events Management and Kiddo Land breathed life into the old and dry bones of the braai area that used to be the place to be for people who wanted a temporary refuge from the hustle and bustle of city life in Bulawayo. The weekend New Year’s Family Fun Day Chillas saw families rollercoaster riding, speed boating, canoeing, horse riding, quad biking, swimming, drinking, braaiing and unwinding. Phillip Phiri, one of the founders and director of Modern Magnet Investments, a company on a drive to promote tourism within the Matabeleland South region said: “The turn up at the club was more than expected and yes, I can safely say that our set objectives were fulfilled. We’d like to thank all the people who supported us. <img class="alignnone wp-image-584888 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-42.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-42.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-42-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Being a first-time event, it wasn’t smooth, but all the people were behind us as they supported us all the way. To the people of Matabeleland South and Bulawayo Metropolitan Province, we say this is a dawn of a new era and we hope to build our Family Entertainment and Tourism Centre to be a top-class destination to cater for all ages.” Phiri went on to promise a Valentine’s Day event worth noting next month. He said it is their desire to host events monthly to cater to entertainment and tourism lovers. “Due to the high demand that we’re getting from the general public, we’ll be working flat out on having the same event on the 15th and 16th of January. In February, we’ll have a different theme being that it’ll be the month of love. “It’s our mandate to have Valentine’s Day that people will not forget so we’re calling on lovers to come in their numbers and enjoy aquatic games and luxuriate in style as we celebrate love and tourism. So people should expect something unique at Matopo Sailing Club,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-584893 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-43.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-43.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-43-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said the reintroduction of the club was a sure renaissance to the region’s tourism sector. He said the chillas was a success since the turnout was great for the weekend getaway. “We had a successful family fun day partnership with Morden Investment at Matopo Sailing Club. The event was well-attended and had positive response from the local market. “It was a two-day event that was attended by over 800 adults and kids,” said Farawo. —  @eMKlass_49
