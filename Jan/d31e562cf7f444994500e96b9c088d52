THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) is expected to unveil candidates for its elective congress set for Mtshabezi High School on January 29. According to the Buz notice, there will be elections for president, treasurer general, president of the commercial commission and president of the 3×3 commission. “This being the year of the constitution, we needed to conduct an exhaustive process so that we defend the congress and election integrity for future generations. We received a total of 23 nominations for nine executive positions from eight provinces. This has to be a record. Congratulations colleagues, we are part of history,” said Buz president Joe Mujuru. “The nomination committee has sat and the final list of eligible candidates is ready. Due to the overwhelming interest in this election and in the interest of transparency, the final list will be announced at a press conference.” According to the election notice, the Buz congress shall consist of a maximum of two delegates each per affiliated provincial association with the right to one vote. The voting right shall be granted to the first delegate if both are present. The two delegates must present a document signed by the president of their provincial association proving that they are delegates representing that association. The congress will, among other issues, seek to resolve the Charmaine Chamboko debacle, which has rocked the association in the last few months. According to the Harare and Bulawayo Basketball Associations, the Buz executive committee had contravened its constitution by allowing Chamboko to remain in office after her election to the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee board as chairperson of media, communications, public relations and diplomacy in April last year . – @innocentskizoe
