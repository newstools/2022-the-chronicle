FEMALE Ndebele Rap Queen Awa Khiwe has paid homage to everyone who supports the genre after she became the toast of last year’s Matabeleland regional music when she clinched the number one spot on the Skyz Metro FM Top 100 chart show. Awa Khiwe achieved this through her hit song Ngeke Bengimele, a song that led her to Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) victory as she scooped the Outstanding Hip Hop Artiste/Act accolade last year. On the Skyz Metro FM charts, Awa Khiwe was followed on number two by Motion Tellers featuring Ghost and Barack with the song Dai Deng while Mxolisi “Mr Bones” Ndlovu’s Ex Yami song took the third spot. RoilBAA 2021 People’s Choice Award winner Mai Mwamuka’s Igama Lenkosi took position four while Nomvula by Fab G uMshanakagogo was on position five. Completing the top 10 were Pauline Njini’s Ekhaya, Germany-based Nomina’s Luthando lo, Uyavuma by Martin and Ndolwane Super Sounds, Uyingcwele by Everton Mlalazi and Mawiza’s Entumbane KuGogo. On taking the number one spot, Awa Khiwe said it was an honour. She paid homage to Skyz Metro FM for giving artistes from Matabeleland a platform to shine. “When I started making music, we didn’t have a radio station in Matabeleland so it was a struggle to get our music to the people. I appreciate Skyz Metro FM for giving our music a home and I wholeheartedly appreciate everyone who supports Ndebele Rap. “We should continue celebrating our music, art and culture and aim for greater heights,” she said. Skyz Metro FM personality Possenti Sikosana said the top 100 were selected from their charts that were held over the year. “The selection of the top 100 chart was based on Gospel Top 10, Top 20 charts, music rotation, and analysis of all our playlists for the year,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire.
