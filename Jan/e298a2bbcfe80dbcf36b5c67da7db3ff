THE Government is in the process of refurbishing equipment at airports around the country with the exercise at the Victoria Falls International Airport already complete. In an interview with Zimpapers Television Network, the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development Felix Mhona said work was being done at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport and others. The country needs about $15 million to re-equip air traffic communications and surveillance systems to enhance the safety and efficient movement of aeroplanes. “What we have is obsolete equipment that we are refurbishing. There is a contractor right now at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport; and at Victoria Falls we are done with the installation of state-of-the-art aircraft monitoring equipment and this is precisely what we are doing and in the first quarter you will see the new equipment installed,” said Minister Mhona. He dismissed reports that planes are landing and leaving the country undetected because of obsolete radar equipment. Minister Mhona said there was no chance that an aeroplane can cross the Zimbabwean air space or land and take off without being noticed. “People are saying there are no air space management tools to monitor and that planes are flying into the country willy-nilly. Let me assure you if you have got one of your planes, try it and see if we won’t catch you,” said Minister Mhona. — @bonganinkunzi
