Wedding venue: We had a two-day wedding. The first ceremony was held at Euphorie Events, Killarney in Bulawayo and the second day was a traditional one held at Southern Cross Estate. How did you meet?
In December 2011, I went to my rural home in Mkuwa, Kezi to visit. While walking through Maphisa Business Centre, Balekani approached me and started chatting me up. He said he wanted to be my friend and then we exchanged numbers and started communicating from there. He works in South Africa so we’d call each other regularly until he returned in December 2012. He then said he wanted us to take the relationship to the next step as he loved me. I said yes. On June 13, 2013, he sent a delegation to my family and asked for my hand in marriage. He paid part of the lobola and then on August 14, 2021, he came and finished off. We then held our white wedding on December 27, 2021. Challenges you faced preparing for the wedding?
The wedding committee that was put in place did not do its job and we ended up organising the wedding ourselves. We also had a misunderstanding with the person who was responsible for decor. On the last day, they wanted to change the decor without consulting us. Following the argument, they said they wanted to pull out and return the money we had paid, but thanks to the wedding planner Owen Longwe, the dispute was resolved and everything went on smoothly. Wedding colours: Powder blue, peach and white. Wedding dress: They were two. The first was a pure white Ballgown with crystal detailing supplied by South African designer – Cheche Designs. The second was a traditional dress with yellow, black and white colours to capture the Kalanga culture. <img class="alignnone wp-image-584859 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/weddiong-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/weddiong-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/weddiong-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bridal team: had 14 people with Mncedisi Nyathi best man and Pamela Dube as best girl. Cake: An eight-tier marble light blue fresh cake. Favourite part of the wedding – When everything went accordingly as planned. Thanks once again to Owen Longwe for making sure everything went accordingly. The most touching speech – was my husband’s wedding vows. I was over the moon as I was not expecting those words. They made me happy and he cried while he was saying them. On the menu – Cocktails, snacks, creamy samp, roasted chicken and beef, and chocolate mousse for dessert.
