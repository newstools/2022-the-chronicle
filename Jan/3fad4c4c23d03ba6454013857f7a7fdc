EMAKHANDENI-born Lady Cheetahs rugby player Robin Mhembere is excited by the prospect of representing the country at the Regional Seven’s South competition set for Lesotho. The tournament is a new initiative by Rugby Africa to ensure all member states are given an equal opportunity to qualify for the Africa Cup Sevens. The competition will run from January 29-30. Teams that will take part in the event are Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswatini and Malawi. The 22-year-old Mhembere says she is ready for the challenge ahead. “I’m very excited to be part of the team. The goal is to score tries and possibly win the tournament so that we make the nation proud and all the other young ladies that look up to us. “Just to be part of the team is a special recognition for me. I know competition in the national team is stiff, but I am ready to represent my country,” said Mhembere. A 15-member squad is in camp and will be trimmed to 12 shortly before departing for Lesotho on Wednesday. The remaining three members will be non-travelling reserves. The Lady Cheetahs have secured kit sponsorship from joint RocoMamas for use in the competition. RocoMamas said they decided to sponsor the team since the Lady Cheetahs are known for a fast-paced brand of rugby.
