DECEMBER is normally a very busy month for creatives with shows lined-up and sometimes, solo artistes cannot cope with the pressure. Such a demand for performances has led to the formation of a new band called The Big Ray that specialises in jazz music. Led by veteran jazz singer, Ramsey K, the band was formed in December and comprises other experienced artistes in the industry, Precious Ndebele, keyboardist and music producer Benjamin Shawa, bass guitar player Ashley. “AshBass” Ndlovu and percussionist, Tyrone Tyie. The band, a hot potato within the industry has been performing regularly at the Umguza Yacht Club since the festive season began. Speaking to Chronicle Showbiz, Ramsey K said the band has been receiving a warm reception from patrons following the few performances they have staged thus far. Umguza Yacht Club, an establishment with a vast number of activities yesterday played host to the band as they celebrated Ronald Stone’s 31st birthday. Besides Umguza Yacht Club, the band has performed at Happy  Valley in Mzilikazi and Matsheumhlophe Social Club. The band that has an authentic live sound promised to keep the momentum going as the year progresses. AshBass said going forward, to ensure diversity, they are going to be recording new songs and covers of popular songs as well. — @eMKlass_49
