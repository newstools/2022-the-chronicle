MUSIC producer, songwriter and beatmaker Leemzy (real name Lee-Roy Muzenda) continues to support local talent through his Music Lab home studio. The studio that has been operating since 2015 is situated in Pumula South and is currently undergoing renovations so as to meet international standards. Leemzy said improving the studio’s standards is part of his plan to ensure that the work of local artistes is appealing so as to attract diverse audiences. Narrating his music journey, Leemzy said: “I embarked on the journey of music in 2010 as I was passionate about making music. This led me to set up a studio and I opted to set it right where I reside. “Now, I’ve formed a record label that has in-house artistes who include Pumula Royal Arts And Community Awards (Praca) award-winning hip-hop artiste AOK Prontoe, TGd Blick, Vidho M, Mimmy Blaq, Hyena, ACM and Dozamane. To date, we have realised full-length projects and we’re working on upgrading our equipment.” Leemzy said the main goal of the studio is to ensure they give up-and-coming artistes a platform to showcase their art by providing them with a venue to record. A musician in his own right, Leemzy’s musical career has seen him being part of a group called The Day Ones which managed to release a compilation EP titled Call It What You Want in 2017. Among a number of projects that he has done, Leemzy has worked with the likes of late rapper Cal Vin, Collinbeats, Slickah Beats, Liege, AOK Prontoe, Uno Xo, Zazul, Blick, Hyena and Acquilah K. For his efforts, he has been nominated twice for Praca for his role as a music producer. – @mthabisi_mthire.
