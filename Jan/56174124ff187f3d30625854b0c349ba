TWO people have drowned in Matabeleland South province within a week, police have said. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the two drowning cases. On December 31, a 65-year-old man drowned while attempting to cross a flooded river in Colleen Bawn.
Insp Mangena said the now-deceased was coming from local shops where he had been drinking with his friends. “Around 1400hrs on December 31, James Dube left his home and went to Salelema shops that are about one kilometre from his home where he drank alcohol with friends until around 1600hrs when he left for his home,” she said. “It had rained whilst he was at the shops and when he got to Salelema River, it was already flooded and when he attempted to cross, he drowned.” The body was discovered on Monday by a young boy who was fishing. “His body was found trapped in a log by a juvenile who was fishing along the river,” she added.
In another case, a 12-year-old boy drowned in Insiza River near Mathanda 2 Mine on Monday while swimming with his friend. Insp Mangena said police in Filabusi are investigating the case.
“The boy had gone swimming with his friend around 1500 hours and those who saw him drowning failed to rescue him. A search was conducted by villagers and his body was found and taken to Filabusi district hospital,” she said. “I would also like to remind members of the public that anyone can be a candidate for drowning so let us avoid entering water bodies during these heavy rains as one can never be sure about the depth of any water body.”
