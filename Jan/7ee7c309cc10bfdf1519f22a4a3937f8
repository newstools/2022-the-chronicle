LADY Cheetahs coach Derek Chiwara says they will go all out to earn a ticket to the Africa Cup Sevens when they compete in the Regional Sevens tournament set for Lesotho over the weekend. The Regional Sevens (South) tournament, is a new initiative by Rugby Africa to ensure all member states are given an equal opportunity to qualify for the Africa Cup Sevens. Four regional tournaments North, South, East and West, have been established and only the winners of each tournament will go through to the next stage. Zimbabwe are in the same group as hosts Lesotho, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswatini and Malawi. “Preparations have gone on well so far with the ladies training three times a week prior to camp. The mood in camp is positive and the ladies are bonding quite well on and off the field. They fully understand what is at stake and push each other in training. “The team has set goals and is aiming to be highly competitive in Lesotho. Each game is being treated as a final and we are hopeful of pulling through as tournament winners. Our chances of winning are high, although you can never underestimate other teams or the preparations they put in,” Chiwara said. Lady Cheetahs Squad
