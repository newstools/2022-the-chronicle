The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter
FOR long, Bulawayo has been known to breed diverse creatives in the precinct and in the streets of Mpopoma, a nascent guitarist Theo Mellow Soul (real name Theophillus Chawaguta) has been part of that conversation lately. The guitarist, who is part of Conga Brothers, a quartet of musicians who have vowed to take over nightlife in the region recently released his debut single titled Guitar Man, which features local producers, Collin, Collus Move and Dank Moses 420. The track, with an Amapiano beat, was released last weekend and has set the tone for what should be Theo Mellow Soul’s breakthrough into the music scene with his tantalising guitar-playing skills. The first time I met Theo was in November when, together with his friends, The Conga Brothers they toured the mining town of Gwanda for a show. His guitar-bag gave me a hint of what he was about, but when the time came for the quartet to perform, Theo came alive and blended well with the vocals of fellow band members, DJ Stinah and livewire choreographer cum-lead singer, Fozah the Black Rose. That performance left the crowd hungry for more and, in unison, chorusing, “encore” repeatedly. He would later recollect that live performance as a “very special and surreal moment in my career”. Chronicle Showbiz tracked down the guitarist who narrated his musical journey. <img class="alignnone wp-image-587192 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-13-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-13-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-13-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Theo describes himself as “a passionate artiste, composer and session guitarist who loves expressing his thoughts, feelings and imagination through the powerful art of music.” The 26-year-old narrated his upbringing up to the point where he first got to stroke his fingers on the strings of a guitar. “The journey started way back in the day when I was a toddler, around four years thereabout. I went to a pentecostal church back then and when it was praise and worship time, I used to go on stage and imitate what the instrument guys were doing. That hunger and passion were not nurtured that early. “Then around 2007, I tried to join the music school at church, but it didn’t work out so well. It happened that when I completed secondary school, I picked up a guitar at church and I was shown the first three chords and that was enough initiation into the music world. Since then, I’ve fallen deeper and deeper in love with the guitar,” is how he would narrate his steps to being a guitarist. The dreadlocked fellow conceded to being a session guitarist before joining forces with Conga Brothers saying he sessioned with musicians who include Vocal Ex, Makula Music, Adrian Lee Jazz and IvaJoy to name a few. On how his fans are receiving his new single, Theo said the response has been positive and encouraging. “The response to my debut single has been so overwhelming. I’m forever humbled. You know the uncertainty of getting out of your comfort zone and being vulnerable is not a walk in the park. The reaction from my fans has been nothing, but uplifting and encouraging. “Such an appreciation gives one goosebumps and I can only try to replicate such form or even do a better song the next time I hit the studio. The Amapiano vibe with some sweet melodic guitar lines doing the singing is how I would describe my sound,” he said.
Quizzed on what type of guitar he specialises in, Theo would not want any confinements and said he plays not just many types of guitars, but is a diverse instrumentalist. “I play the guitar, not just the bass, but I’m well versed with the lead and acoustic ones as well. I can play a bit of piano too, but I’m still learning,” he said while chuckling. If ever there is something that Theo is so sure of in life, that would be his roadmap for the year 2022. He has a personal and collective plan in place. “In 2022 I have a solo album coming up before the year ends. <img class="alignnone wp-image-587193 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-12-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-12-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-12-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It’ll feature a number of great musicians and as Conga Brothers, we have quite a lot in store for the world. We have beautiful music yet to be released. We will push singles, albums, and gigs in and out of Zimbabwe to solidify our place in the entertainment industry,” is how his laid-out plan for the year sounded like. Behind every successful being are a plethora of things and Theo is “inspired by quite a number of things and individuals. Firstly, I’m so fascinated with this idea of who I am and my role in this time and space. The idea of just getting to really know who I am inspires me to the core to tap into all the treasures within and without me. “Musically, I’m inspired by my dearest brothers who have helped me become the guitarist I am today. These include Mokoomba guitarist Trust Samende, Elphas Shamblo, Outfit guitarist Sam ‘Samuzik’ Siwela, Kinah The Music, Adiel and John Mayer to name a few.” Theo sees a very fruitful career in the music business and wants to use his guitar-playing skills as a potent weapon in his quest to attain greatness. The Mpopoma resident is also an applied chemist by profession and is into personal development organisations, namely What Are You Becoming (WAYB) and Uplifting Hearts. He is also a cricket player and is currently studying Philosophy. – @eMKlass_49
