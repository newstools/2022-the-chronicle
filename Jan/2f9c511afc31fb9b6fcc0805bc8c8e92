The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent THE Midlands province is on high alert for cases of flooding or any eventualities owing to heavy rains that have been pounding most parts of the country recently, Acting Midlands Provincial Director of Local Authorities, Mr Fortune Mpungu has said. A tropical storm has so far caused damage in other parts of the country destroying bridges and other infrastructure mainly in Manicaland Province. Some dams across the country are now filled to capacity while others are spilling owing to the heavy rains. Mr Mpungu said Midlands province has activated all its district civil protection units (CPU) in preparation for any eventuality. “We are on high alert and we have activated all our district CPU in case of any eventuality. We have also identified alternative tentative accommodation in case we have flooding victims or displaced families,” said Mr Mpungu. Gokwe North and South districts which usually experience flooding are yet to be affected this year. “The province is intact so far as we are yet to receive any report and we remain ready for any challenge. We are also glad that we are yet to hear of any cases of flooding in our flood prone areas like the two Gokwe districts,” said Mr Mpungu. He said the Government was working on repairing some roads damaged by heavy rains like Gowe -Nemangwe and the Gokwe-Manoti Roads. Mr Mpungu said the only challenge in the province was the Gweru flooding in Mkoba, Ascot and Mambo areas which Government is also working on addressing. “We only have one case of flooding in Gweru which is a result of poor urban planning. But I am glad to say that the situation is under control as we speak. Work is being done by the Government and the Gweru local authority to ensure that the drains are cleared. Drains had been blocked mainly due to urban farming practices by residents and they are being cleared,” he said.
