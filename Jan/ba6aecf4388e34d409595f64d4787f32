THERE is an exodus of senior players at defending league champions FC Platinum, but the club insists their departure is due to their new age cap policy. FC Platinum have reportedly resolved not to renew contracts of any player above 28 years under the club’s new strategy. “It’s a shift in direction of our strategy. We will be able to share more details the moment the head coach returns,” said FC Platinum spokesperson Chido Chizondo. Sources, however, said the shift in strategy was as a result of infighting by the club’s business partners. It is reported that one of the business partners has been at loggerheads with the club’s executive on why they were being omitted from club management appointments yet they were pumping huge money into the project. FC Platinum is run by FC Platinum Holdings, an independent company that is also into catering and events management. It has other partners that also pour money into the football project. “There is a lot happening behind the scenes. The exodus of senior players is not by coincidence, but financial resources are dwindling as a result of boardroom fights and the club then decided to settle for youngsters because they know that their demands won’t be as huge as senior players. “So, it was then decided to use what one may call natural weaning, wait for the contract to expire, dangle a very low offer knowing the player will refuse and it’s done,” said the source. FC Platinum have so far seen the departures of Silas Songani, Stanley Ngala, Rahman Kutsanzira, Ralph Kawondera and Kelvin Madzongwe. Reports also link goalkeeper Petros Mhari with an exit, although the club refuted these reports. Chizondo said she wasn’t aware of claims of infighting among the club’s sponsors. “With regards to implosion with sponsors, that I am not aware of.”
