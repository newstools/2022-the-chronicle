THE Chevrons have all to play for when they face Sri Lanka in a series decider at Pallekele Cricket Stadium today. The two sides are level at 1-1 with today’s match expected to produce a series winner. Sri Lanka won the first ODI by five wickets in a match where Zimbabwe had posted a healthy score of 296, but failed to defend the total. The Chevrons, however, redeemed themselves by producing a polished all round performance that saw them beating the hosts by 22 runs. Captain Craig Ervine was the hero for Zimbabwe with his knock of 91 helping them to a total of 302 for 7. This time around Zimbabwe’s fielding was superb and they won the game to keep the series alive. The two sides were in this situation in 2017 when they headed into the final ODI tied two-all. Zimbabwe won the deciding fifth match by three wickets in Hambantota to stun the hosts 3-2. It was Zimbabwe’s first away series victory since 2009, and one of Zimbabwe cricket’s finest moments to date. Today’s decider carries further significance owing to the fact that both sides will be hoping to gain ground on the World Cup Super League. The Chevrons have picked up just three wins in the 10 matches they have played. The wins have been over Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Ireland. A win for Zimbabwe could see them climb over South Africa into position nine on the 13-team log standings. Sri Lanka on the other hand have picked up five wins from 17 matches and are fifth on the log. Zimbabwe (possible side):
