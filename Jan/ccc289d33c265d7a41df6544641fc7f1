Preparations for the inaugural Style Icon Awards are underway with nominees drawn from across the country set to be announced next week ahead of the awards showcase on February 12 at the Rainbow Towers. The awards will honour Zimbabwean fashionistas, designers, writers, bloggers, retailers, business personnel, pastors, corporates and stylists. It is being held in partnership with Gateway Stream platform who will also stream live the event. One of the organisers of the event, fashion blogger  said this event was long overdue. “We’ve been having a lot of award ceremonies in the country, but the fashion side has been overlooked. “As a team we decided to honour players in the fashion world,” she said. “We’ve been planning this event for five months and everything is going according to plan.” Madyara who is affectionately known as “Hollywood Lee” said they have set aside a team that is finalising the nomination list. “We’ve engaged some of the local pioneers of fashion who are to deliberate on the nomination list. “The list will be announced on Monday via different social media platforms,” she said. The personality said the event will have performances from local and foreign acts. “For now, we can’t release the list of performers as we still have to finalise the contracts. “We’ll be sticking to the Covid-19 regulations and restrictions on the numbers of attendees hence why the event will be showcased on virtual platforms,” said Hollywood Lee.
