PANTHERS Taekwondo Academy president Vusa Ncube says their main goal this year is to improve students’ grading after they spent the past two years stagnant. A grading assesses one’s technical ability, knowledge, indomitable spirit and physical conditioning, and most importantly allows rank advancement. Ncube bemoaned the Covid-19 enforced shutdown, but said they had already hit the ground running, trying to make up for lost time. “If you look at it, all the students have regressed, especially in the aspect of grading (changing of belts) so that is one aspect we really want to focus on. Also, it’s been a while since we had any competitions so, in that regard we are planning on having at least one big tournament every quarter of the year. This will help our athletes get back in shape,” said Ncube. He also hinted they might open academies in Matabeleland North where he feels pure talent remains untapped after a trip to the province on a factfinding mission. Taekwondo, Tae Kwon Do or Taekwon-Do is a Korean form of martial arts, characterised by punching and kicking techniques, with emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping spinning kicks and fast kicking techniques. The sport remains a minority discipline with most people shunning it because of the perception that it is a violent sport. — @innocentskizoe
