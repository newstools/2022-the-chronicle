The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief
THE Bulawayo High Court Circuit will from Monday be sitting in Gweru for two weeks during which 12 murder cases will be heard. Midlands provincial prosecutor Mr Samuel Pedzisayi confirmed the development in an interview yesterday. He said the 12 murder cases will be heard before High Court judge Justice Evangelista Kabasa. “The first term of the High Court circuit for the Midlands Province is starting Monday, January 24 and 12 cases will be heard before Justice Evangelista Kabasa for two weeks,” said Mr Pedzisayi. Mr Pedzisayi said the murder cases involve 19 accused persons, mostly artisanal gold miners, who allegedly engaged in deadly fights over gold claims and crimes of passion. He said in one of the cases, Morgan Nsingo (32) from Mberengwa allegedly stabbed a fellow villager with an okapi knife killing him on the spot while his family watched in horror. Nsingo, Mr Pedzisayi said, of Nkami Village under Chief Bvute in Mberengwa will be facing one count of murder. On May 3 in 2017 at around 6AM, Nsingo, he said, armed with a knife arrived at Mr Bloodwell Musiiwa’s homestead where he started accusing him of assaulting him the previous day while they were at Bvute Business Centre. “The accused who was armed with an okapi knife drew it from his pocket and stabbed Mr Musiiwa once in the chest and he died instantly in front of his children and some relatives before Nsingo fled from the scene,” said Mr Pedzisayi. He said a report was made to the police leading to Nsingo’s arrest. In another matter, Mr Pedzisayi said a 20- year- old man from Chireya Village under Chief Njelele allegedly killed his father whom he accused of witchcraft.
