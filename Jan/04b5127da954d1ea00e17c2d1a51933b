BULAWAYO rapper, ABSOLL LUZ (real name Abraham Sandile Juba) who ventured into the music industry last year has set sights on bettering his craft this year. On his embryonic career, the 19-year-old who has managed to release two singles believes that he has done enough to earn street credit. Under the clutches of the Covid-19 lockdown grappling the nation last year, ABSOLL LUZ said he had a perfect opportunity to finally put into action the idea that he had contemplated on for quite some time. “I believe that from the tender age of two, I had a musical ear as my mother told me that music would stop me from any mischief when I was a toddler. “Around 2017, my music teacher taught me all the ins and outs in the music business and last year, I started recording,” the rapper said. His projects, Over my head and My love were produced in October and November last year. “Over my head talks about being overwhelmed by the pressures of life and having God as my pillar of strength in the hard times. My Love talks about the feeling of being in love with someone very close to you and you reciprocating it,” said the rapper. ABSOLL LUZ said that the two projects will serve as a springboard to a better 2022 where he plans to release two more singles and an EP. “2022 should be a better year for me as I anticipate greater things. I will record two more singles and an EP early in the year,” he said. The rapper has in the past worked with Motion Tellers, TRB Music and FREKE Beats. An avid fashionista and basketball fan, the artiste says he became a hip hop fan at a tender age, hence his decision to venture into the genre. — @eMKlass_49
