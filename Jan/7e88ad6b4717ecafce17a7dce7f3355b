The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter A-budding- gospel artiste Ngakudzwe Ncube has released a four track album titled Handirambe. The tracks are Be my saviour, Rangarira, Handirambe and  the Lord is standing and all songs in the album were composed by her. The tracks were recorded at GM Studios in Gweru, mixed and mastered by DJ Kule. The 24-year old songstress born and bred in Senga, Gweru said the album is meant to appeal to the youth, as most of them are caught in wrong doings hence it is a way of encouraging them to do good things. Ncube said her passion for music began at a tender age when she would sing in church, it was only late last year when she decided to go to the studio to work on her project which was released last week. “I started singing at church, I never took my talent seriously until my peers encouraged me to go to the studio, it took me about four months to put this project together,” she said. Ncube added that the producers were happy with the way she packaged her voice as a result leading the producer to record her. “When I went to the studio, I never thought my voice or my style of singing would make a mark since most producers and disc jockeys are interested in Amapiano, and Zim dance hall tunes. I was very much delighted when the producer gave the nod that they wanted to work with me,” she said. The artiste is looking forward to launching her album next month and she has already started distributing her music to various radio stations in the country and the music has been received well by many gospel lovers.
