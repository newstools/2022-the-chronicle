The Zimbabwe Gender Commission has taken over the sexual harassment case involving female referees in the country while the referees have also opened up a criminal case with the police. The harassment, believed to be rampant and to have been going on for a while, came to light in 2020. Despite being made aware of the matter, Zifa has been reluctant to act on the issue, claiming that it was handed over to its judicial bodies. The alleged abuse of female referees is one of the reasons that led to the suspension  of the Zifa executive committee by the Sports and Recreation Commission in November last year. “The matter was delicate in that one of the officials has a huge influence within the police force so junior officers were hesitant and felt powerless, but we are happy now that dockets have been opened and we now have case numbers,” said an SRC commissioner. The Commissioner said their counterparts at the Zimbabwe Gender Commission have been informed and were now handling the issue with the urgency it deserves. “Yes, we have that report and our legal department is working on the matter. If you can talk to them they will give you more details,” said a Commissioner. Tinashe Mazani from the ZGC legal office confirmed receipt of the sexual harrassment report, but referred questions to the chief executive officer Virginia Muwanigwa, who could not be reached for a comment. “Kindly talk to our chief executive officer. For now all I can say is that we are yet to talk to the parties.”
