FOLLOWING expiry of his contract with Chicken Inn FC on December 31, striker Obriel Chirinda is expected to complete his move to Bulawayo Chiefs, a club he signed a pre-contract with last year in August. Chirinda, who turns 25 on January 28, has been on the radar of Highlanders FC unbeknown to the Bulawayo soccer giants that the player struck a deal with ambitious Chiefs inside the last six months of his contract with the Gamecocks. Chiefs have been doing their business quietly, strengthening their squad as they  build a foundation to challenge for the championship. “Chirinda signed a pre-contract in August last year and all other outstanding matters have been attended to. When training resumes next week, Chirinda will be part of the squad and will earn his first Bulawayo Chiefs salary at the end of January. So, when we see reports that there are teams chasing after him, it doesn’t bother us because we know that he is now a Ninja,” said an authoritative Chiefs source. Chirinda will be registered during the mid-season transfer window which opened on New Year’s Day. Other players that will be registered alongside Chirinda are striker Obidiah Tarumbwa who started training with the club in November having left Talen Vision and former national team defender Ian Nekati who was signed from Chicken Inn last year. Nekati couldn’t be registered last year as he was signed after the registration window had closed. The Chiefs source said the club is also closing in on a goalkeeper, utility player and an attacker to be registered before the closure of the transfer window.–@ZililoR
