A 46-YEAR-OLD Inyathi woman was strangled in Bubi District, Matabeleland North by unknown assailants, police have confirmed. The motive of the murder which occurred last week remains unknown. Police have identified the deceased as Mavis Tshuma. Matabeleland North provincial police spokesperson Inspector Glory Banda confirmed the incident. The woman is alleged to have left Turk Mine Business Centre to visit her daughter nearby at night but did not reach her destination. Her body was discovered following a search in a busy area on a path leading to her daughter’s home. Insp Banda said the woman had been selling at the business centre during the day before leaving for her daughter’s home at around 8PM. “On the fateful day, Mavis Tshuma who had spent her day selling chicken cuts at Turk Mine Business Centre decided to visit her daughter’s house at Zesa compound in Inyathi. She left her husband behind at Turk Mine Business Centre at around 8pm. She did not return in time which prompted her husband to make a follow-up,” said the police spokesperson. “He discovered that she had not reached the supposed house. A search was conducted and her body was found lying in a bushy area along a footpath which leads to ZesaSA residential quarters.” He said the suspect strangled her and inflicted a cut with an unknown object on top of her right eye. Insp Banda appealed to members of public with information which can lead to the arrest of the accused person to contact the nearest police station. He urged people to desist from walking in secluded areas alone, especially during the night. — @themkhust
