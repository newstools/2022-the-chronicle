THE Grain Marketing Board (GMB) has announced that its chief executive officer Mr Rockie Mutenha is set to step down at the end of his five-year contract that expires in April this year. He was appointed GMB chief executive officer in May 2017. This was after the parastatal had gone for two years without a substantive general manager when Mr Albert Mandizha who had been at the helm of the marketing board from 2008 to 2014 left the organisation. In a statement, GMB said Mr Mutenha’s stepping down was in compliance with its retirement policy. “Mr Rockie Mutenha steps down, on retirement as chief executive officer and board member of the Grain Marketing Board on 30 April 2022 in compliance with the GMB retirement policy,” it said. During his five-year contract, GMB said Mr Mutenha provided leadership during a period of significant business challenges and successfully achieved grain intake rebound from a low of 208 311 tonnes in 2016 to 1 099 117 tonnes last year. “He has vast experience in managing businesses in the agro-industry and held executive position with various organisations. The board, management and entire staff of the GMB wish to extend their gratitude to Mr Mutenha for the services rendered to the organisation and wish him well in his retirement and future endeavours,” said the grain utility. Among other qualifications, Mr Mutenha holds a MSc Marketing, MSc Strategic Management and a Masters in Business Administration. He joined GMB from the Agricultural Marketing Authority where he was the chief executive officer. AMA is another parastatal under the purview of the Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Ministry.
