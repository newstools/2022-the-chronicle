WARRIORS coach Norman Mapeza has allayed fears of midfielder Kundai Benyu missing the match against Malawi after he picked up an ankle injury in their Afcon finals group opening match against Senegal on Monday. Zimbabwe suffered a last-minute heartbreak, with all their hard work coming to naught when they conceded a penalty in the dying seconds of the match. Liverpool superstar Sadio Mane converted the spot kick emphatically to claim all three points for the Lions of Teranga. The 24-year-old Benyu, a late inclusion in the Warriors’ squad, was withdrawn in the 72nd minute for Thabani Kamusoko, as the technical team feared aggravating the player’s injury. Benyu had done fairly well in central midfield where he partnered Kelvin Madzongwe, shutting out Senegal’s attack through the centre. Mapeza also explained why he pulled out captain Knowledge Musona, who had a subdued game, for Never Tigere in the 87th minute. “Musona had flu-like symptoms so he started to feel tired. Benyu had a knock on his ankle, but it’s not looking that bad,” said Mapeza. The introduction of France-based striker Tino Kadewere in the 46th minute for Prince Dube was purely tactical, as the Warriors wanted him to pierce through the Senegalese’s watertight defence. – @ZililoR
