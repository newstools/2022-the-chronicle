THE African Union Sports Council Region 5 Regional Annual Sport Awards (RASA) are expected to return next year as sporting activities have now resumed. The awards were suspended due to Covid-19 that affected the sporting calendar in 2020 and 2021, with limited competitions in some instances. However, there has been some progress with more sporting activities now back. AUSC Region 5 chief executive officer, Stanley Mutoya, confirmed that the awards would be back in 2023. “The awards are only reverting in 2023 because what we realised was that yes in 2021 there were Olympic Games, but that’s it, the Olympic Games and the Region 5 Games that we had. “So we are hoping that sport is slowly resuming and we will allow that to happen,” said Mutoya. The awards are held to recognise, reward and celebrate the Region’s sportspersons for iconic and meritorious service in sport. The awards are a culmination of all the member countries’ national awards. Winners of the member countries’ awards automatically become nominees in the 11 categories of RASA. Zimbabweans that have previously won the regional awards include motocross rider Tanya Muzinda and wheelchair athlete Elford Moyo.
