IT was a late kick-off between Kwekwe United and Filabusi at Baghdad in matchday four of the Zifa Central Soccer League at the weekend which the home side won 2-0. Tongogara also collected maximum points by dismissing Loss Control 2-0 at Battlefields. FC Platinum Under-19 hosted Vumbachikwe at Mandava and emerged 1-0 winners, while Sheasham registered the biggest win of the weekend, thumping visitors Paramount 3-0 at Gweru Sports Club. Sheasham assistant coach Brian Zingwe believes scoring early in the match gave his charges an advantage. “The early goal that we scored gave us an advantage in today’s match, as we are trying to top the league table by the end of the season,” said Zingwe. Paramount coach David Choga blamed his side’s loss on the waterlogged pitch. “If we had played on a good pitch we could be talking a different story. Remember we are still learning since we are new in the second tier league, that’s football,” he said. ZPC Munyati were the only home team to lose when they were edged 0-1 by TelOne in Munyati. Bishopstone and Dulibadzimu played to a goalless draw, while the game between Chapungu and MSU at Mkoba Stadium was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.
