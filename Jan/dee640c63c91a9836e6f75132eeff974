There is a photographer that people should look out for this year as his visual excellence continues to see him work with prominent figures in the entertainment scene. Popularly known as Gidds, Gideon Muzezewa, a professional photographer has worked with elite creatives in the country including rappers Takura and Asaph, but being in the presence of the Gafa, Winky D was the peak for him. Born and raised in a small village in Mberengwa, Gideon told Chronicle Showbiz how it all started. “My photography journey began in 2015 in what started as a way of volunteering at my local church. It then grew into a hobby and later became an obsession with creativity. I’m much of an introvert and I try to use photography as one of my ways of expressing myself, and bringing out the best in my subjects. “My specialty is in commercial and editorial portraiture. I also get commissioned for my ability to use lighting and composition to create dimensional images,” said Gidds. The photographer who is based in Bulawayo worked with the Happy Again singer last year when the Gafa was working on visuals for Rudo Harurovi. His job was to cover the behind-the-scenes images and portraits. “Working with Winky D was quite an amazing experience as I’m a big fan. He’s such an interesting and introverted character, yet very easy to work with. In him, I basically see myself and that made it easier for me to work with him. He’s such a professional,” is how Gidds would explain the experience. The photographer’s creative edge and eye for visually compelling pictures have also made it possible for him to do portraits for fast-rising songstress Mimmie Tarukwana, Nate, Tarryn Talana, Thandy Dhlana and cricketer John Nyumbu. — @eMKlass_49
