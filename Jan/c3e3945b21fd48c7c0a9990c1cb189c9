A 49-year-old man has been jailed for five years for having sexual intercourse with a minor. The man who cannot be named to protect the identity of the 15-year-old girl appeared before Gweru regional magistrate Mr Christopher Maturure facing one count of rape and one count of having sexual intercourse with a young person. He pleaded not guilty to both charges but was convicted of having sexual intercourse with a minor and not guilty to rape after a full trial. In passing sentence, Mr Maturure said the man acted unlawfully by engaging in sexual activities with the girl. “The accused person exposed the victim to sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy when it was his duty to even protect the young girl as his own. The accused is sentenced to five years in prison,” he said. It was the State’s case that on a date not known between 2020 and 2021 the victim was in the garage which they use as a cooking place for all tenants residing at the same house. The court heard that the accused person came out of his room which is also at the back of the garage and asked the victim to accompany him to his bedroom and she refused. He dragged her into his bedroom and closed the door.
