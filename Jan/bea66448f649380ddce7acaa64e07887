THE Ratanang FC technical team was forced to watch their side’s 1-0 victory over Arenel from the terraces after they failed to produce licences prior to kick-off. Only team medic Angelina Musaengana and the substitutes sat on the bench for the Zifa Southern Region Division One encounter. Innocent Mapuranga, who heads the coaching department, together with his assistant Chipo Tsodzo are yet to get their licences. Despite the coaches’ setback, Ratanang managed to pull a victory, their second of the of the season after pipping Talen Vision 1-0 in their opening encounter. Mapuranga said they are not getting carried away by the two impressive victories. “In terms of the licence issue, that will be sorted this week. Our manager is on the matter and finalising the final documentation. We are confident that by next match day the whole issue will be settled. “As a club our target for this season is to ensure that we stay in the league. For us it’s all about staying in the league. We are not placing ourselves under any pressure. These boys are really putting in good shifts, which is good. I am glad we have had a great start to the season. Now the boys must make sure they guard against complacency,” said Mapuranga. Just like any ambitious side, FC Ratanang wants to be in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) within five years. The club is a partnership between Imbesu Mine and other overseas partners. *Southern Region Division 1* Week 2 Results
