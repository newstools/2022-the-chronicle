DAM levels in the southern region have started rising following incessant rains that have been experienced in the past weeks. In a statement, Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) corporate communications and marketing manager, Mrs Marjorie Munyonga said the water held in the dams is sufficient to support summer irrigation requirements as well as the domestic needs for major cities and towns. She said as of December 30, the national dam level average was 77,3 percent which is higher than the 59.7 percent normally expected during this time of year. “Dam level increases have been noted in 19,7 percent of the country’s major dams with 10, 69 percent of the same actually recorded declines. No changes were recorded in the rest of the dams, which constitute the remaining 69.7percent,” she said. The rise is seen in dams of some parts of the country, especially the Southern Region in response to the wet spell experienced in the past days. “Positive changes in dam levels have been recorded in dams in Mashonaland East, Bulawayo, Matabeleland North, Midlands and Matabeleland South provinces such as Khami, Insiza, Mtshabezi, Zhovhe and Antelope while Tshangwa and Ngwenya Dams in Matabeleland South have started spilling,” said Mrs Munyonga. She said the water held in the dams is sufficient to support summer irrigation requirements as well as the domestic needs for major cities and towns. Mrs Munyonga urges all farmers involved in summer irrigation to approach their respective service centres and sign water abstraction agreements as required by law. ZINWA statistics show that Bulawayo, Matabeland North and Matabeleland South water supply dams have sufficient water.
