DANCE outfit Sungura Masters who relocated to South Africa last year have heaped praises on their fans who they said showed them immense support during the gigs they held in the neighbouring country. The group that hails from Entumbane shifted base due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown that saw live shows being put on hold locally. The group then decided to seek greener pastures across the Limpopo river. They managed to perform at places that include Hillbrow Inn, Mackzeem, Diplomat, Zebra Pond and Newton where they shared the stage with the likes of Thomas Mapfumo and Alick Macheso. In order to stay in touch with their local fan base, some of the group members came back to the country for festive season performances in Tsholotsho, Filabusi, Kezi, Shangani and Bulawayo. Sungura Masters founder Masotha Nzou said it was good to be back home as the love for their talent still lives in their fans. “Being back at home was a great moment for us as the audiences really welcomed us well, the same with the reception that we received at our shows in South Africa,” he said. He said they are looking forward to a fruitful 2022 and are working on new productions to ensure that their fans are kept entertained. “We’re now working on a few productions locally before we head back to South Africa where more shows are lined up. Our fans should gear up for more live energetic entertainment,” said Masotha. —  @mthabisi_mthire
