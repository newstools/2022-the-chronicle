The Chronicle MANCHESTER CITY’S revenues out-stripped those of neighbours United by more than £73million last season – according to newly-published figures. Pep Guardiola led his team to a third Premier League title in four years in the 2020/21 season — while also taking them to the Champions League final. And those were key factors in City recording operating revenues of £537m for last season — a jump of around 17 per cent on the previous 12 month period. It also dwarfed the £464m brought in through broadcast, match day and commercial income across town at Old Trafford. The report — produced by consultants KPMG — highlights the impact the pandemic has had at the top end of English football. And it shows for the first time that it is City who are currently the dominant force in the city as far as finances are concerned. The figures demonstrate how City’s recent run of success has turned them into a new superpower of English and European football — while the Red Devils have not won a trophy since 2017. The hope in the United boardroom will be that the return of fans — with hospitality and full stadia — will see them overtake City again in 12 months time. The financial results for last season have yet to be published by City but the report by KPMG shows they made £108m from going all the way to the Champions League final. Broadcast revenue rose by 55 per cent to £279m — though that figure was inflated because some games were moved into 2020/21 from the previous season. That helped to offset the dramatic loss in match day revenue as games were played behind-closed-doors because of the pandemic. Their commercial revenues rose by 8 per cent to around £255m — beating those of United who brought in around £232m in the same period, according to the report. — Daily Mail
