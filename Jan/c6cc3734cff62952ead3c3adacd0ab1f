Chronicle Showbiz caught up with the artiste who narrated his five-year journey in the music industry. The artiste said the success of landing radio airplay is one of the factors which has instilled the hope to breakthrough in his career. “I started doing music in 2016 with my first track titled Ngenani. The track managed to get airplay on Skyz Metro FM and this is one of the things that pushed me to work even harder. “Ever since then, I’ve managed to drop singles that include Ntombazana lilizela, Ama 2000, Diliza ‘mbumbe and Uthando warriors which is an anthem for Zimbabwe’s Warriors,” said N.K Warrior.
