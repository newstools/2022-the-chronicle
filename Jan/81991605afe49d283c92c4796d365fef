PLANS are at an advanced stage for Kwekwe City Council to set up a waste recycling plant which will in the long run result in electricity being generated from waste. The local authority has since set aside a 50-hectare piece of land near its sewage treatment plant where the waste management and recycling plant will be located. In an interview, acting Kwekwe Town Clerk Dr Lucia Mnkandla said the local authority was working with Government to establish the plant. “The site has been established and plans are at an advanced stage to establish the plant. We have identified a 50-hectare piece of land near our sewage treatment plant at the Dutchman’s Pools were we intend to set up the plant,” said Dr Mnkandla. Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Nqobizitha Ndlovu said Government will assist the local authority in it’s plans. “Government in partnership with Kwekwe City are at an advanced stage to design and construct a state-of-the-art waste landfill that is capable of handling both municipal general and hazardous waste. This is key in developing and expanding the economy,’’ said Minister Ndlovu. He said the move was also in line with the demands of the NDS1 priority area of regulating waste initiatives. “I wish to report that the clean-up programme has developed into a waste management multiple-strategy system and now include the promotion of waste management and recycling and green industry at small and medium-scale level,” he said. During a clean-up campaign in Kwekwe last Friday, President Mnangagwa said Government will offer support to the initiative given that Kwekwe was the first local authority to implement the project. “Some local authorities have been given the same opportunity to set up waste management and recycling plants but have ignored. I am happy that Kwekwe have taken heed and therefore will get total support from central Government,’’ said President Mnangagwa.
