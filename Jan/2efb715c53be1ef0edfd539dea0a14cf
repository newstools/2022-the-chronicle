The Chronicle The Word of God is always the key to maintaining a faithful life. Strive to expose yourself to the Word. The soul and spirit of a man is designed to hear the Word. It feeds on the Word and if you starve it, it becomes frustrated, and it struggles. When your spirit is strengthened, there is nothing that can cause you to backslide, and you begin to reap the benefits of being faithful to God. You live long on earth Deuteronomy 34:7-8: Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His [b]eyes were not dim nor his natural vigour [c]diminished. And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended. (NKV) He lived long and the Bible in Numbers 12:7 says, “Not so with My servant Moses; He is faithful in all My house.” Moses died at the age of 120; this age is called “ad me’ah v’esrim” in Hebrew which means “live up to or may he/she live until a hundred and twenty years.” This is often said, as a birthday wish for long life when mentioning a person who is getting on in years. It refers to the length of Moses’ life. “Ad me’ah v’esrim.” The parallel Yiddish Hebrew expression is “biz bundert un tsvantsik (yor)” and is also used in Jewish English. It is an age that one cannot reach when one lacks faithfulness. Joseph, David, Abraham among others also lived up to that age because they were truthful and faithful. In this era, living even up to 90 years is a miracle; we regard such people with awe because it is now rare. Joseph, David and Abraham were faithful to the Lord, so they increased their years on earth. Additionally, Moses is the only man who died and was buried by God because he was very faithful in God’s house, (read Deuteronomy 32). Moses was so faithful that God could allow no one else to bury him, or find out where his grave was. God can bury people on His own even though we do not see Him He can do it through His power. God bless you!
