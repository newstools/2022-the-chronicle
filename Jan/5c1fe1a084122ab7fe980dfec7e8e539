TWO people died in two separate road traffic accidents in Bulawayo on Wednesday, police have confirmed.
Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said the first accident occurred in Entumbane suburb at around 11.30am. “A 16-year-old boy, who is unlicensed drove a Botswana registered pick-up truck which did not belong to him. The car was parked on a road in Entumbane and an 11-year-old boy doing Grade 5 at Mthombowesizwe Primary tried to board the car, while the driver was reversing, but he fell and his head was crushed,” he said Insp Ncube said the unlicensed driver, who is being charged with culpable homicide, will be released into the custody of his guardians since he is a minor. He urged drivers to keep their vehicles and keys in a safe place where no one can access them. “People should not authorise unlicensed people to get hold of their vehicles or leave their car keys in the vehicle as they risk losing them to thieves or suffering a fate like this one,” said Insp Ncube. He said the second incident involves a hit-and-run incident at the corner of Fife Street and First Avenue. “The incident occurred around 1am on Wednesday where a pedestrian was knocked down by an unknown vehicle, which did not stop, and he died on the spot. “The man is aged between 35 and 40 years and was wearing a black t-shirt, white takkies and a khaki pair of trousers. He was crossing the road because he was found in the middle of the road with his head crushed. The man did not have any form of identification on him,” said Insp Ncube. He said any family missing a relative that matches the description is advised to approach the police. Insp Ncube urged members of the public to always carry some form of identification so that it’s easy to identify them if something happens.
