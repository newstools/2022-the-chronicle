MOTHER earth is teetering under two pandemics, one caused by global warming, the other by the Covid-19 pandemic and both of which have left humanity in the global village under virtual siege. Omicron, a variant of the first global pandemic caused by Covid-19 is littering graves in its wake as people resort to World Health Organisation protocols of social distancing, washing hands and sanitising to escape the viral scourge, while climate change as a variant of global warming is responsible for recurrent droughts that have incinerated food crops in Zimbabwe, leaving people with hollow bellies and the Government holding out the begging bowl to the world for food. Other variants of global warming, Cyclone Idai which hit Chipinge causing floods that destroyed homes and properties not so long ago was followed by Tropical Storm Ana which also wreaked havoc in Manicaland.. While Zimbabweans cannot be held responsible for breeding the coronavirus, we in this country must be bracketed with other culprits in the global village for causing global warming through irresponsible activities such as pumping toxic gases into the atmosphere with the result that the ozone layer which protects Earth from the sun’s rays is rendered wafer thin, causing Earth to heat up resulting in climate change with its negative effects on nature and life. Or do our lackadaisical attitudes, in this country and of others elsewhere in the global village towards taking drastic measures to protect mother earth from global warming influenced by one of the world’s economic power, the United States of America which pulled out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, claiming that the accord put the US at a disadvantage vis-à-vis rival economies elsewhere on the globe. The pull out by that super power saw American factories with unmodified chimneys and coal power plants continuing to pump out smoke with toxic carbon gases into the atmosphere thereby aggravating global warming with climate change and its consequences as a result. To date, the new administration of President Joe Biden is not known to have returned the US to the Paris Agreement as he told the world on getting into power. While other countries may be engaged in unknown dangerous activities inimical to the environment and impinging on the global climate, actions negative to the environment by Zimbabweans are so glaringly errant that environmental protection gurus elsewhere in the global village and familiar with Zimbabwe must be wondering why those who run the Environment Management Agency in this country appear to twiddle their fingers when they ought to lay their hands on people causing desertification by cutting down trees to sell firewood in urban areas and elsewhere, hunt with fire or light veld fires to prepare farming land, as well as on those who build homes on wetlands and have had only to be ordered by the powers that be to relocate to suitable, dry land instead of being severely punished by the Government for environmental degradation. Veld fires spew carbon gases into the atmosphere, thus contributing to ozone damage with devastating effects of global warming and droughts, et cetera. On the positive side, trees absorb and sink carbon gases, thereby preventing them from eroding ozone and worsening global warming. News about the Natural Climate Adaption seminar held in Bulawayo this week must no doubt have been received with greater relief and joy by people who have waited long and anxious for decisive measures to be taken to protect the environment and the climate at large, considering that Bulawayo is unarguably Zimbabwe’s industrial hub but with factories that remain unmodified thereby contributing to global warming and climate change as a result. Phone reference by Zimbabweans elsewhere in the country to the City of Kings and Queens as “Ko ntutu ziyathunqa” or “smokes that bellow”, referring to smoke from the chimneys at the power station and from factory chimneys therefore is tragically ironic when considering the negative effects of global warming and climat e change as by-products of carbon gases from that smoke. But now Zimbabweans will no doubt wait anxiously for the National Adoption Plan by the Government through the Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality as announced by the permanent secretary Mr Munesushe Munodawafa when he addressed the seminar. He said the “National Adoption Plan” which would be buttressed by a climate change adaption communication strategy to clearly indicate Zimbabwe’s vulnerability with a view to mobilising resources from international climate funders. “Better late than not”, so goes the old altruism commending delayed action, rather than total abstention, in putting right things gone awry.
