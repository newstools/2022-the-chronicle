LOCAL producer and sound engineer MduSevan (real name Mduduzi Ngoma) has set his sights on grooming young talent while also working with seasoned artistes. MduSevan shared his plan for 2022 with Chronicle Showbiz. “This year, I’m grooming young talent and also working with seasoned artistes like Ronald Stone. “Swizzy Anderson is one of the artistes that I’ll be pushing this year. I’ll be managing him and arranging shows and possible endorsements. “I also have young producers under my wing and these include DJ Ntu2kay, Lourenzo, Lungz D, Sparks 45 and MPrincebeatz,” said the producer. The Zambezi Magic-approved sound scorer said his vision is to release more music and visuals, especially that from new talent. Tomorrow, MduSevan is set to release a song titled Umuntu Womuntu that will be accompanied by its visuals. The song, his composition, features Ronald Stone and Swizzy Anderson and will be released at the Jazz Cafe. At the launch party that has been dubbed, “Umuntu womuntu video release party”, a host of DJs including Rhaftoe, Smitho, Kays and DMA will take turns to perform. Umuntu Womuntu was arranged and mixed by Kead Wikead, a popular DJ and mastered at the Cradle Audio Lab by Lungz D. “The song is about current affairs and real-life issues. “It’s about dating someone who belongs to someone else. It’s a reflection of the decay that we’ve come to accept as normal in our society.” — @eMKlass_49
