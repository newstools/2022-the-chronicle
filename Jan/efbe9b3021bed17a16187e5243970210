THE poor state of football stadia in the country continues to haunt the local game, with the Zifa Central Region Soccer League becoming the latest victims. The league was forced to postpone games that had been scheduled for yesterday due to unplayable fields. All the country’s stadia have no reliable drainage systems, leaving them water-logged even after a minor downpour. “We regret to inform you that our midweek fixtures scheduled for Wednesday have been postponed due to bad weather forecasts. Unfortunately, heavy rains have been forecasted in the next few days by the Meteorological Services Department, including on match day. “We thought that due to harsh weather conditions, teams might face challenges in travelling and pitches might not be conducive for playing. Matches will be shifted to a later date feasible for all teams and we will continue to monitor the situation,” the Central Region said in a statement. Shesham FC top the league table with 11 points from five games followed by Tongogara, who are one point behind with one game in hand. TelOne, who were relegated from the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League in 2019, are fourth with eight points. MSU anchor the log standings with one point from three outings. While Zimbabwe’s domestic season normally runs between March and November, the Fifa and Caf calendars start from August to May, and there has been increasing pressure to align the domestic calendar with the international one.
