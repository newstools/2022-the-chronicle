A Zvishavane herd boy has been arrested for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl who was on her way to write an Ordinary Level examination. The herd boy (20) appeared before Gweru regional magistrate Mr Christopher Maturure facing one count of rape. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. The herd boy was remanded in custody to January 10. The court heard that on December 15 last year at around 11AM, the accused person was at Kinsale grazing lands in Zvishavane herding cattle when he met the victim, whose name has been withheld to protect her identity. Prosecutor Ms Eggrina Matutu told the court that the girl was on her way to school when the accused followed her. The court heard that the accused person forcibly got hold of the victim’s blouse and ripped it open. Accused then forced the victim into the bush, threatened her with an okapi knife before ordering her to remove all her clothes. In fear, the victim complied. The herd boy allegedly went on to push the victim to the ground and raped her once. The court also heard that while the accused person was getting dressed, the victim stood up and ran away naked to a nearby homestead where she was given a dress to cover herself. A report was made to the police leading to the accused person’s arrest.
