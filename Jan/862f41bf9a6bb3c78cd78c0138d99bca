WHITE City Stadium will host the double header Zifa Southern Region Division One Wafa Wafa knockout competition semi-finals this weekend. The double header features Bosso 90 against Hwange in the first semi-final and Arenal battling with Indlovu Iyanyathela in the second. The first semi-final will kick-off at midday, with the second game starting at 3pm. Zifa Southern Region board member for competitions Fiso Siziba said: “The semi-finals are set for this weekend. The only outstanding issue for now is are we going to be playing on Saturday or on Sunday. We are waiting for council, the owners of the facility to update us. From our side we are good to go. I would say we are more than ready for the two explosive encounters. “There shall be strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols, with police details and Covid-19 compliance officers we trained making sure that only vaccinated people are allowed into the stadium and monitor the programme.” The competition marks the return of football in the lower league after a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19 and is meant to get teams ready for the race for promotion. The Division One League is tentatively set to start on January 15.
Winners of the Wafa Wafa competition, whose sponsor will be announced in due course, as the Zifa Southern Region is still “tying up loose ends” before the launch, will get US$3 000, with losing finalists going home with US$2 000. Wafa Wafa semi-final fixtures Bosso 90 vs Hwange
