POLICE in Bulawayo are intensifying enforcement of lockdown regulations by tightening the noose on errant bars, nightclubs and shebeens around the city and arresting the owners. Since New Year’s Eve, police have been enforcing the curfew hours of 9PM to 6AM by raiding bars, nightclubs and shebeens, and arresting patrons violating curfew hours. A total of 690 people were arrested in Bulawayo on New Year’s Eve for various crimes, including violating lockdown regulations. However, there are some nightspots around the city that continue to operate outside curfew hours even after repeated police raids. Since last week, police on bicycles and cars have been patrolling and closing down nightspots for violating Covid-19 regulations. Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said in order to curb the opening of bars and shebeens, police will now be arresting the owners. “We are enforcing the law and all the beer halls, businesses, liquor outlets and bars that are operating outside the law will be raided. Not only the occupants or the workers, but the owner is accountable,” said Insp Ncube. “Even shebeens; quite a number of them have been raided ever since New Year’s Eve. There’s a shebeen in Makokoba which was raided on New Year’s Eve and this past week it was raided again.” Insp Ncube urged members of the public to comply with the law. “We urge people to comply with the law and desist from frequenting and operating shebeens. We have been arresting them, but other stakeholders like the Bulawayo City Council will have to come in and also play their part. We shall be arresting and taking them to court,” said Insp Ncube. — Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
