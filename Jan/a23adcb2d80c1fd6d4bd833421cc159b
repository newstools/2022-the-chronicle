LADY Cheetahs coach Derek Chiwara says his players are geared up for the Africa Regional Sevens World Cup qualifiers that get underway in Lesotho today. The two-day rugby tournament will see Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia and the hosts tussling for the top spot to progress to the next stage of the qualification process. “The team has taken time to acclimatise and had a light session today (yesterday). We have no injury worries and all players are raring to go. They have put in the work and it’s now time for execution. We are going to take it game by game. The mood in camp is very encouraging and the players are in a good space,” said Chiwara. “We have been fortunate not to have any injuries in camp so far and pray we don’t get any. As it stands, we don’t have any Covid-19 positive cases, and with regular tests happening we hope for the best.” The Rugby World Cup Sevens will take place for the first time on African soil in South Africa next year. The Regional Sevens (South) tournament, is a new initiative by Rugby Africa to ensure all member states get an equal opportunity to qualify for the Africa Cup Sevens. Zimbabwe Women’s 7s team
