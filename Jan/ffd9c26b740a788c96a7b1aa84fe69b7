CIGARETTE manufacturing concern, Pacific Cigarette Company (PCC), has launched its re-branded Pegasus and Branson brands as part of the company’s efforts to expand its portfolio and dominate local and regional markets. The latest brands were launched in Harare last week. The two brands, came into existence in 2008 to complement the Pacific range flagship but have been rebranded to give them a fresh look. They will now be available in toasted and menthol variants. Speaking at the official launch, PCC general manager Mr Itai Watinaye said: “Pegasus and Branson have always been part of our brand portfolio, catering for select markets and offering world-class quality and flavour at affordable prices. By expanding our offering, we will be providing more choice to these discerning customers and doing so at unbeatable prices.” Pegasus has the Hong Ma which has been produced to cater for the Chinese market in the region and the toasted variant while Branson comes in two variants as well which are mint and flame. Introduced in 2021 and distributed by Empire Tobacco, Hong Ma has proved to be a cigarette of choice for most Chinese because of its distinct Chinese flavour. Speaking at the same occasion, PCC sales and marketing manager Ms Ashleyn Mukamba revealed that her organisation will be launching the menthol flavour on the Branson line later this year. “We have more surprises coming in the Branson line later this year,” she said.
