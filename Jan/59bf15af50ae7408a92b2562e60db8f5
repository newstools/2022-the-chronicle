The Chronicle THIS test comes from the Lord to test whether you are doing the right things for the right reasons. It comes to examine those who are doing right to see why they are doing what they are doing. God wants to know why you are attending church. At times God will bring poverty into your life to see whether you will keep going to church or you will stop. Do you go to church simply to get a financial blessing or do you go to church to seek God? Job 1:1-11: So do you love God for God or do you love God for what He can give you? This is the question that the devil uses in the Spiritual Courts of Law concerning your life. Most Christians are motivated to go to church because of the Testimonies in their lives. You can testify about 5 times then God will bring the Motivation Test. It seems like a stagnation period because God wants to check if you love God for whom He is or if it is for what He can give you. When God brings this test, He is challenging the devil, to say that you love Him for who He is, not what He gives you. Job 1 vs 20-21: Job worshipped God yet he had lost all his children. Most of us when something is taken away from our lives we grumble and murmur but you must simply bless the Name of the Lord. We came into this earth with nothing and we will leave this earth with nothing. No one is born with any clothes. Job lost 7 000 sheep, 3 000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys and he lost 10 children in a single day but after losing all these things he said “Blessed Be the Name of the Lord”. Money that you have worked for, for 10 years can be wiped away in seconds by hackers or robbers. It is better to give to God and store your treasures in Heaven. You can lose what you have in 24 hours, even the richest person in Zimbabwe right now; they can lose everything in 24hours. No matter what, don’t give up and don’t backslide.
God Bless.
