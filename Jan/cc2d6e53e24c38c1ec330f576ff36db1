WARRIORS’ captain Knowledge Musona had his first training session with the team yesterday after joining camp in Cameroon. According to a team update provided by Zifa, Musona trained with the team for the first time yesterday. Musona joins camp after being nominated for the December Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Star of the Month Award Western Region. The 31-year-old has scored three goals in three games for his Saudi Pro League team Al Taai. His form is likely to excite coach Norman Mapeza, who has a tough call to decide who will lead the Warriors’ front line in Cameroon. The other forwards in the side are Admiral Muskwe (Luton Town), Prince Dube (Azam), David Moyo (Hamilton Academical), Knowledge Musona (C) (Al Tai), Tinotenda Kadewere (Olympique Lyonnais). The Warriors’ preparation have not been perfect, with injuries forcing the withdrawal of Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba, France-based defensive midfielder Marshal Munetsi and Brendan Galloway, while personal commitments hindered right-back Tendai Darikwa from being part of the Afcon finals’ squad.
Qarriors squad Goalkeepers: Petros Mhari (FC Platinum), Martin Mapisa (FC Zamora), Talbert Shumba (Free State Stars) Defenders: Peter Muduwa (Highlanders), Alec Mudimu (Torpedo Kutaisi), Takudzwa Chimwemwe (Nkana), Jordan Zemura (AFC Bournemouth), Godknows Muriwa (Dynamos), Gerald Takwara (Venda Football Academy), Teenage Hadebe (Houston Dynamo), Bruce Kangwa (Azam), Onismor Bhasera (Supersport United) Midfielders: Kelvin Madzongwe (FC Platinum), Thabani Kamusoko (Zesco United), Never Tigere (Azam), Kudakwashe Mahachi (Supersport United), Ishmael Wadi (JDR Stars), Kundai Benyu (Vestra)
