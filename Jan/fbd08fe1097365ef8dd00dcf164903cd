Multi-talented musician cum actress Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele yesterday celebrated her birthday by releasing a house track accompanied by a video. The song titled Sara Baartman features South Africa’s Professor and was produced by DJ Klap while the visuals were shot in South Africa by Slowman Films. The song sung in Shona, Zulu and Sotho carries an educational message to girls that they should not allow themselves to be lured by men and boys who only want to use them. The visuals are largely a traditional affair with the traditional costumes and a bush set up. Listening to the track and the linguistic diversity, it shows that Sandy as always is maturing like fine wine by tapping into various genres. Although Sandy did not reveal her actual age, she said, “A lady’s age is meant to be a secret but all I can say is that hayi sengikhulile sengisiya guga. “To celebrate my special day I have released a track that I expect to be a banger and will be found on my YouTube channel. “For the coming year my fans should expect more music and more videos,” said Sandy. —  @mthabisi_mthire
