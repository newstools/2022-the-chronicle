RAHMAN Gumbo has been on a fairytale return to the Botswana Premier League after leading debutants Sua Flamingoes into a credible third place after the first-half of the season. In fact, the Sowa Town-based side, which appointed the former Warriors’ coach in April last year, has the the same number of points with second-placed football powerhouse Township Rollers, a team that was once home to Gumbo which he led to the 2009/10 league title. Flamingoes and Rollers are on 30 points, four behind first-half leaders Gaborone United, and have the same statistics except for goals conceded. Both teams have won nine times drawn three times and lost twice, but Gumbo’s side has conceded nine goals, one more than Township Rollers. With a mazy run in their debut in the topflight, Gumbo says the boys now believe they can even go for the jugular when the second-half of the season begins next month. “My boys are new to the Premier League and I honestly didn’t expect this good showing. The boys are working hard, listening and following instructions. They are easy to work with and we find ourselves joint second with Township Rollers, a big club here. “Now my boys believe they can compete with the big guys and competing means they now believe in themselves. With this fighting spirit and a bit of luck, we can hope for a good second-round and fight to finish in a good position,” said Gumbo, who has previously won league championship medals in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Botswana. He won his first league medal as a rookie coach with Highlanders at the turn of the century and retained the bragging rights the following season before an unceremonious exit after only three games in his third season with the Bulawayo giants. He went on to collect his third league medal and first outside the country in 2006 with MTL Wanderers of Malawi.
