NEWLY elected Matabeleland Golf Society president Vincent Makamure said Hwange gold course will not host any national tournament, including the flagship Hwange Open, until it has been revived. The course’s fairways and greens have all withered due to excavations just outside the club. “I am saddened by its deterioration, but I believe there is now a different management that seems eager to improve the condition of the course. As long as the course remains in its current state, we cannot hold the Hwange Open,” said Makamure. The natural water springs that used to supply water to the course have now been taken over by an investor, who is using the water to subdue dust from the mining of quarry. Previous efforts by the Hwange Colliery Company to drill boreholes were abandoned after it was discovered that the water was not ideal for watering grass. The Hwange Golf Course is one of five courses under the Matabeleland Golf Society stable with Elephant Hills Golf Course, Harry Allen, Country Club and the country’s oldest course, the Bulawayo Golf Club. The Hwange Open championship was shelved at the last minute in 2018 and while it took place in 2019, professional golfers shunned the event due to, among other reasons, the poor state of the course.
