CELEBRATORY messages from all over poured for rapper Asaph (real name Tafadzwa Tarukwana) as he turned 30 yesterday. The rapper from Bulawayo shared a photo of his former self and his new snap on Twitter alongside a caption with the words, “Happy Birthday to my damn self. More Life King. Now let’s go and make your wildest dreams come true!!! #AsaphAt30.” To celebrate, Asaph said he will likely have a private birthday party this weekend. “Tuesday was my birthday and I celebrated it with close friends and family at a private venue in Matopos. On Saturday, my fans can expect a surprise function to revel my 30 years of existence,” is how the Mambo singer would describe his plans for his birthday. Lately, Asaph has had many reasons to celebrate as he became a torchbearer to other Bulawayo or should one say, Zimbabwean artistes after putting pen to paper on a mega record deal. This brought to light the kind of Decembers Asaph usually has — fruitful ones. December seems to be the time when Asaph comes out to play. In 2020, he was shortlisted to represent Zimbabwe in the MTV Africa Music Awards (Mama) People’s Choice category alongside Gemma Griffiths, Winky D and Sha Sha while in December 2021, he bagged his most-precious gong, a recording deal with Def Jam Recordings Africa. To date, Asaph has 2 EPs and three albums to his name. He is also a recipient of multiple awards since launching his career way back in the day. It’s only a matter of time before we find out what kind of December will Asaph have this year, especially given the huge expectations that come with signing for a major recording label. — @eMKlass_49.
