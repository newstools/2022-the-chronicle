THE Zimbabwe National Karate Federation (ZNKF) has resolved to create clusters to help them run the organisation more efficiently. ZNKF recently got recognised as the only official international karate body in the country late last year by the World Karate Federation at its congress held in Dubai. ZNKF president Joe Rugwete will lead the strategic development cluster, with his deputy Lizzy Mupure in charge of the medical commission, safe sport and para-karate cluster. Moraq Flight will take charge of the finance department, secretary-general Tirivenyu Mutema will head the disciplinary and management commissions and executive committee member Chipo Mashingaidze will head the media, marketing and women in sport cluster. Technical director Fradsonn Shavi will oversee the technical, referees and athletes’ commission. Rugwete said: “We are basically doing this to increase accountability as well as efficiency in the running of our affairs. The reason we have allocated these clusters as an executive is to ensure people are responsible for various performances. The executive team is the main board which governs the sport, but within the executive we have tasked each other to head these departments for easier execution of duties.” According to the ZNKF calendar, there are a number of regional and international events it expects to participate in. The international tournaments include the World Games to be held in Birmingham, England, the UFAK Championship in Bamako, Mali, FISU UWC Combat Games in Ekaterinburg, Russia and the WKF Cadet-Junior and Under-21 World Championships, which will be held in Konya, Turkey.
