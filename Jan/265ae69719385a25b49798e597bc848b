THE Athletics Board (BAB) has opened entries for its first track and field event of the year to be held at White City Stadium on February 5. The athletics season kicked off at the weekend with the holding of the provincial cross country championships at Mpopoma Park. BAB chairperson Watson Madanyika said the National Track and Field Championships would be contested in the 100m, 200m, 400m, 1 500m, 3 000m, 100m hurdles, 110m hurdles, 400m hurdles, 4×100m, triple jump, long jump, high jump, shot put and discus. Entry fees are pegged at US$3 or $330 for juniors, while seniors will pay US$4 or $440.
He said a number of programmes have been lined up for the 2022 season that are meant to develop athletics in the province. “We are inviting schools, varsities and clubs to register their athletes for the meet. We are hoping to have a big turnout of athletes in this event, especially given that things have opened up this year and we are most likely going to have all the events according to our national and provincial calendar,” said Madanyika. According to the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (NAAZ) calendar, Old Mutual remains NAAZ’s main sponsor for road races, covering six races in different parts of the country, including the Tanganda half-marathon in Manicaland. Some of the events to be hosted by NAAZ will include the National Open, National Junior Championships, Inter-Club Championships in Harare and Bulawayo, and National Inter-provincials.-@innocentskizoe
