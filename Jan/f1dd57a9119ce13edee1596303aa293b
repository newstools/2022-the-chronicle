HIGHLANDERS will exercise due diligence in filling the vacant post of chief executive officer recently vacated by Nhlanhla Dube. Bosso parted ways with Dube at the end of last month after four years heading the club’s secretariat since taking over from the late Ndumiso Gumede in 2017. Club spokesperson Ronald Moyo was appointed acting chief executive officer at the beginning of October last year when Dube took three months’ leave prior to leaving the club. Highlanders’ chairman Johnfat Sibanda said the office of chief executive officer was critical, especially now when Bosso are on a drive to commercialise their brand to make the club self-sustainable in the next three years when their current sponsorship from Sakunda Holdings runs its course. As a result, Sibanda said they would not be headhunting as some people are suggesting, but would instead follow a proper and international standardised recruitment process. “There are no delays in appointing a new CEO. The CEO just stopped work on the 31st of December 2021, so it’s work in progress. We have to make sure that we do it right. It’s a critical area, so we cannot rush. It’s a process that has to be carried out carefully,” said Sibanda. Sources, however, intimated that Bosso had already identified potential individuals that will be interviewed for the position, and these include a former club executive committee member, a veteran media personality as well as a former Caf employee with years of experience in football administration.
