AS 2021 came to a close, people made resolutions for the New Year and rapper Lynden resolved to avoid being broke in January. When the rest of the world was popping champagne, toasting to 2022, Lynden released a “January disease” song titled Tchelete last Friday. The song that has been plastered on major online music streaming platforms was composed by D.K The Punisher and mixed and mastered by B-kID. It is a Wreckersvale Entertainment product. Lynden told Chronicle Showbiz that his last song for 2021 had 2022, particularly January in mind. “Most of the time, we suffer from January disease after too much merry-making during the festive season so the song is a hustler’s anthem. Tchelete also talks about family, friends, and navigating the Zimbabwean rap industry and mastering the art of survival in a country where we find it hard to make ends meet,” said Lynden. The rapper made a comeback to the music scene late last year after a two-year sabbatical. As the hunt for the much-needed Tchelete (money) goes on for Lynden, he will be dropping visuals for New Religion in the month of love, February. — @eMKlass_49
