The Chronicle Airport staff in Mauritius have found a newborn baby boy abandoned in the rubbish bin toilet of a plane’s toilet. A 20-year-old woman from Madagascar, suspected of having given birth on the flight, was arrested. The Air Mauritius plane, which arrived from Madagascar, landed at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport on 1 January. Airport officers made the discovery when they screened the plane for a routine customs check. They rushed the baby to a public hospital for treatment. The woman suspected of being the child’s mother, who initially denied the boy was hers, was made to undergo a medical examination which confirmed that she had just given birth. Both she and the baby are said to be doing well. The Malagasy woman, who arrived in Mauritius on a two-year work permit, will be questioned after her release from the hospital and charged with abandoning a newborn. – bbc
