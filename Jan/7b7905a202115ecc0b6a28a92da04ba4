The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief
PUBLIC Service Commissioners from the Midlands received their Covid-19 booster shots at Gweru Provincial Hospital yesterday. The first to receive the boosters included Prison and  Correctional Services Commissioner Charles Manzini and Zimbabwe Republic Police Commissioner Plaxedes Gezha. The two were joined by the Public Service Commission provincial manager Mr Andrew Chimanyiwa and Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services provincial head Edwill Moyo. The jabs marked the roll out of vaccine booster shots in the province and the commissioners encouraged citizens to get their third jabs, particularly the elderly. “As you grow older, your immune system weakens, so it is very important to get a booster shot. I am 59 and I challenge all my age mates and those older to get booster jabs today,” said Comm Gezha. Comm Manzini said the booster shot would enhance his chances of fighting Covid-19 should he be infected. He urged all Zimbabweans to get booster jabs so that they have a fighting chance against the pandemic. Covid-19 cases rose from 135 337 in December last year to 223 000 confirmed cases by January 11. A total of 5 180 deaths have been recorded.
