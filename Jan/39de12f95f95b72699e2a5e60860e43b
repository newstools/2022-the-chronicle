The Chronicle ZIMBABWE is set to conclude the national micro, small and medium enterprises survey in the first quarter of the year to determine Small to Medium Enterprises’ contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Taking into account the significant contribution of the SMEs sector to the GDP, it is hoped that the survey would set a solid foundation for the attainment of Vision 2030. Under Vision 2030, Zimbabwe targets an upper middle-income economy status and the milestone is expected to be informed by statistics that guide the decision-making process, hence the move by the Government to spearhead the crafting of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) survey. According to ZBCtv, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Mr Moses Mhike revealed that the survey would be completed by the end of the first quarter this year. “The last MSMEs survey was done in 2012 by Finscope funded by the World Bank and the plan was to have the surveys every after five years. “It is worth noting that this survey was now long overdue as the reflections of the 2012 Survey have become outdated. “The reference point for the characterisation of the sector was no longer palatable to reflect it in any arena hence the heightened need to conduct this survey,” he was quoted as saying in his address to the enumerators for the survey in Mutare early this week The MSMEs survey is being conducted at a time Government is promoting the establishment of more enterprises in rural communities to accelerate rural industrialisation and ensure equitable distribution of national income and wealth. – ZBCtv.
