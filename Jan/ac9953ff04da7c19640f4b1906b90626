The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Reporter THE Deputy Chief Justice of Zimbabwe Mrs Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza officially opened the legal year at the Bulawayo High Court on Monday, calling for the Judiciary Services Commission to digitise its operations to avert the impact of Covid-19. Justice Gwaunza bemoaned the increase in unfinalised cases that stand at 1 642 in Bulawayo, saying Covid-19 had disrupted operations. “For more than six months of the year, the courts were offering very limited services to litigants and the public and even for those limited services, members of the public did not have access to the courts. Such limitations in court operations resulted in fewer cases being finalised as compared to the last two years and in certain instances, the backlog of cases would unavoidably rise,” she said. – @thamamoe
