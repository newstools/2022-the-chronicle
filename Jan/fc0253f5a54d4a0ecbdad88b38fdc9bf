We are already synchronized and we have not even gone through the step practicing phase as yet..” “BoMntase, You are all invited! If you haven’t received your invitation by now khohlwa,” she wrote. A love-struck Sello also took to social media to gush over his new wife Pearl and how happy he is to be married to her. “Someone said marriage suits me but I say, I have been married before, however, this time I chose well as I came from a point of having paid school fees with my previous partners!” “@pearlmphombewe doubles as so many things, a brilliant and loving wife but what many don’t know is I seem like a pro with interviews because she is my PR and Brand Manager who happens to be very good at her job!” he wrote. – SundayWorld
