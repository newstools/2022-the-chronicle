WORRIED about their ageing central defensive pair of Moses Jackson and Guide Goddard, Chicken Inn FC are frantically looking at reinforcing their squad with a centre-back and midfielder during this mid-season transfer window. Chicken Inn captain Jackson will celebrate his 41st birthday on April 11, while Goddard turns 34 in July. The duo played in Chicken Inn’s opening two games, the 1-0 win against Cranborne Bullets on the opening day of the season and the 1-2 away defeat to FC Platinum where Goddard was replaced by 20-year-old Arthur Chinda in the 73rd minute. Joey Antipas, the Chicken Inn gaffer, told Chronicle Sport yesterday that they had intensified their hunt for new signings. “The areas of concern I want to attend to are the central defence and central midfield. Already, we’ve lost striker Obriel Chirinda and brought in Malvern Hwata from Cranborne Bullets as a direct replacement. Now my worry is getting a central defender because the guys are ageing and we need adequate cover. At times we’ve played Nielson Ketala, a natural left-back in central defence and that is why we need a centre back,” said Antipas. “We also did a squad analysis and realised we are lean in central midfield where we’ve got Shepherd Mhlanga, Brett Amidu and Clive Dzingayi. So, if we can get those positions attended to, that will be better for us.” Chicken Inn resumed their training yesterday, with Antipas set to join the squad today. – @ZililoR
