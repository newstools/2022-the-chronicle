SATURDAY was surely a grand finale to remember for ages as scores of people thronged the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) to enjoy the last day of festivities and business. Bulawayo came to a standstill as ZITF marshals and members of ZRP were directing traffic at the turnstiles as people jostled to get in.  The business expo, held under the theme, “Rethink, Reimagine, Reinvent Value Chains for Economic Development” had all the hallmarks of an organised entrepreneurial and entertainment experience. From face paints, head balloons, clowns, train and motorcycle rides, drum majorettes and live music, Bulawayo came alive and everyone was catered for. Techno-savvy folks, showbiz enthusiasts, gaming heads, foodie-lovers, and other entrepreneurial people had one last throw of the dice, visiting stands and networking. Finally, the Batik dress and other Indonesian accessories went on sale. The Indonesian Embassy was one of the international exhibitors to bring their A-game. The ZRP band was a crowd puller with a live performance at their stand while, a stone-throw away, the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) was rendering the same entertainment. <img class="size-full wp-image-603874" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Batik-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Batik-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Batik-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The batik dress on exhibition at the Indonesian Embassy stand at the ZITF In all senses of the word, the 62nd ZITF was the biggest of them all and surely left a lasting impression on both local and international exhibitors and visitors. It was absolutely one to remember and surely, exhibitors served the best for last with massive displays and giveaways. <img class="size-full wp-image-522152" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/winky.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/winky.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/winky-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jah Prayzah and Winky D The event ended with the annual ZITF Shutdown show which saw Harare giants — Jah Prayzah and Winky D performing at The Boundary.
