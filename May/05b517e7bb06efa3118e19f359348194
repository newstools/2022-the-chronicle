A VINTAGE car rally is on the cards in Matabeleland North with a fleet expected to depart Bulawayo today for a four-day “fun on the wheels” that ends in Victoria Falls. By yesterday, organisers were still finalising the list of participants. The concept was developed by the Zimbabwe Safari Rally at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic when regular safaris were suspended and it seeks to create a unique and proudly Zimbabwean adventure and event that combines classic cars and travel with a love of the bush and wildlife.  Organisers said far from being a race, the idea is to have fun using the not-so-fashionable vintage cars through the bush, with the ultimate aim of supporting the tourism and conservation industries. The route starts in Bulawayo and traverses through rural communities in Matabeleland North into Hwange National Park to the Hwange Safari Lodge and back into the national park en route to Victoria Falls. It’s a combination of a joy ride, fun and tourism, with interactions with various tourism and conservation players and along the way. The vehicles have to meet certain requirements specs and ages to enter the rally. “We are limited to a small number of participants as we can only accommodate a few in Hwange National Park. <img class="size-full wp-image-606240" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some of the vintage cars to be used for the car rally in Matabeleland North “It is not a race and is a non-competitive event. The idea was a culmination of styles of rallies such as the East African Safari Rally in Kenya, Mongol style Rally in Mongolia and Top Gear style humour,” said the organisers in a statement. The event is in its second year and organisers said it is gaining momentum. “Through the continued support of a growing audience and broad community of keen safari goers, car enthusiasts and captains of industry, we have managed to help boost many small businesses in Zimbabwe by partnering with them to host and cater for the participants, and we feel it’s a ‘win-win’ for all. “In addition to this and with conservation at the heart of all we do, we have endeavoured to support Friends of Hwange and help raise awareness for their work within Hwange National Park,” the organisers said. The initiative has been getting overwhelming support from various partners, as it showcases Bulawayo, Hwange National Park and Victoria Falls in line with the country’s drive to promote domestic tourism through multifaceted approaches, including sport, among initiatives. — @ncubeleon
