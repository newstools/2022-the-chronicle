TWO days before Highlanders face ZPC Kariba in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Nyamhunga Stadium, club chief executive officer Ronald Moyo could not be drawn into divulging whether interim coach Joel Luphahla has been granted a waiver by Zifa to lead the Bosso dugout. <img class="wp-image-596391 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ronald-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ronald-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ronald-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders’ chief executive officer Ronald Moyo There had been rumours that Luphahla was given a waiver to sit on the bench on Saturday assisted by Melusi Sibanda but a Zifa source told Chronicle Sport that no waiver had been granted to the coach. “Applying for a waiver is not a one-day thing, it’s a process. What makes things even more difficult is that Zifa doesn’t have all its organs functioning fully.  A meeting has to be convened to make such a decision but nothing has happened,” said the source. Highlanders have not come out in the open about the application for a waiver but are believed to be working on it. Luphahla, who survived the chop when Bosso axed Mandla Mpofu and his first assistant Bekithemba Ndlovu, has been in charge of all training sessions. <img class="wp-image-593714 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu Moyo said he will be in a position to comment on the matter at today’s pre-match press conference. “The club is going through normal, internal processes of employing a coach. We will advise once we are done,” said Moyo. – @innocentskizoe
