It is in my nature to give and this birthday presented me with that opportunity. My birthday coincided with mother`s day this year and being a mother, I thought it wise to celebrate it with my mothers resident at this institution. My parents are both late but these people qualify to be my mothers hence I came here. This is my expression of love meant to show them that even if they are here there are people who cherish and love them,” she said. Mrs Ncube said her mother loved sweet things hence most of the food stuff she brought was sweet. “I really feel I have fulfilled one of my dreams. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607612" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-43-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-43-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-43-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> I have mixed feelings today, excited to turn 50 but afraid to face the future. I leave all in God’s hands as he has taken me this far,” she said. Mrs Ncube urged society to remember the so-called forgotten people who are at homes like Entembeni. Entembeni Old People`s home administrator Mrs Nomsa Khumalo expressed gratitude to Mrs Ncube’s gesture and urged other people to emulate her. “We are happy that you have found time to interact with the elderly who are your mothers and fathers. They are lonely most of the time and they enjoy it so much when people come and spend time with them. It makes them feel loved. Some of them have no relatives who visit them as they come from neighbouring countries like Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique so they appreciate such gestures,” she said. Mrs Khumalo said the institution has 60 people and needs a lot of resources to take care of the inmates.  “We need support in terms of food which include mealie-meal and meat. We would do well with warm clothes like jerseys, socks and tennis shoes,” she said. An elderly man from the institution, Mr Mark Ncube hailed Mrs Ncube for remembering them. “We are so proud of her. She surprised us and we are so grateful for what she has done for us. We pray that God blesses her with more years,” he said. -@themkhust.
