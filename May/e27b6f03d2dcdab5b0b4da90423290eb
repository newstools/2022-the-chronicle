A new Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) board was elected last week with new faces making their way to the country’s supreme music body. The role of Zimura is to protect performing rights of authors, musicians, composers and publishers and to collect royalties on their behalf. Such is the duty that should be carried out by the six newly elected board members with two of them, musicians Mudiwa Hood and Goodchild (real name Alexio Gwenzi), being new additions. Those who retained their positions are Albert Nyathi, Philip Chipfumbu, First Farai and Janet Manyowa. Zimura executive director Polisile Ncube-Chimhini said the board is deliberating on introducing new posts with the chairperson and vice set to be announced soon. “The board has elected the chairperson and vice but the names are yet to be released to the public as the board is still deliberating on introducing new additional posts. Once everything is set, we will notify the public,” said Ncube-Chimhini. Chronicle Showbiz caught up with some of the new board members who said they are geared up for their three-year tenure. <img class="size-full wp-image-607726" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mudiwa-Hood.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mudiwa-Hood.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mudiwa-Hood-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mudiwa Hood Nyathi said he was elated that people have given him a vote of confidence as they re-elected him. He said one of the goals he wants the board to achieve is the construction of two Zimura arts centres in Bulawayo and Harare. “I’d like to ensure that the construction of the Bulawayo Zimura arts centre is done speedily and to also acquire a stand in Harare for the construction of another arts centre. The long term plan will be to ensure that we have cultural exchanges in those areas,” said Nyathi. Musician and television personality Goodchild said there is a need to engage every stakeholder of the organisation from all corners of the country. “We have to go around consulting with Zimura members and musicians and hear their issues and expectations. This will then create a foundation of work to be done. However, personally, I’m advocating for Zimura to be a bit aggressive and represent musicians better. <img class="size-full wp-image-453861" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Goodchild-new-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Goodchild-new-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Goodchild-new-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Alexio ‘Goodchild’ Gwenzi “I’ll push the minister responsible for arts to lobby for artistes to receive royalties in USD just like teachers, nurses, tobacco farmers and the like. At least part of our royalties should be in USD,” said Goodchild. “I want Zimura to be a listening association. Most artistes have been finding it tough to access the board. To all members, I’d like to say I’m here now and I’m your link to the highest decision making body in the association thus I’ll listen and carry your concerns so that we all benefit,” added Goodchild. He said he will also push for Zimura to look into other revenue streams besides radio, TV and nightclubs as there is more to collect from on behalf of members, especially with the emergence of digital media. Chipfumbu said one of his goals is to ensure that families of late beneficiaries are given start-up capital for projects.  “Widows of our late brothers who were members of Zimura are suffering. I’d like us to draft benefits that will be set aside in every payout so that when a member dies, their family is given the money as a start-up to pursue businesses,” said Chipfumbu. First Farai said he enjoyed the relationship he had with musicians during his two tenures, something that he will continue pursuing in his third tenure. – @mthabisi_mthire
