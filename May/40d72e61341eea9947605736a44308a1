HIGH flying gospel musician Everton Mlalazi is set to perform in Bulawayo for the first time at a free gospel show dubbed “The Homecoming Birthday Celebration”. The show, slated for May 21 at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair Hall 4, will be double joy for the musician as he will also be celebrating his birthday. <img class="size-full wp-image-607750" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Benjamin-Dube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Benjamin-Dube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Benjamin-Dube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benjamin Dube The musician has not looked back since launching his career in 2020 with his track Uyingcwele which topped the Star FM gospel show for weeks. His album with South African gospel ace Benjamin Dube that was released last year has most of its songs also topping gospel charts at most radio stations. Speaking ahead of his show in Bulawayo, Mlalazi said: “Bulawayo holds a special place in my heart as I’m from Nyamandlovu although I grew up in Gweru and I’m now based in Harare. <img class="size-full wp-image-607752" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Takesure-Zamar.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Takesure-Zamar.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Takesure-Zamar-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Takesure Zamar I’m looking forward to performing there as I’ve performed in Harare, Mutare and South Africa, but I’ve never performed in Bulawayo. So, ngiyeza ekhaya (I’m coming home) and I’m looking forward to it.” The show promises to be a special treat as the musician has roped in a number of notable gospel musicians including Takesure Zamar, Mkhululi Bhebhe, Mai Mwamuka, Vusa Mangena, Pastor Barak, Lorraine Maplanka-Stot, Jonah Chivasa, Focus Accapella and Revealed.  He said besides celebrating his birthday, the show is meant to praise God “for all He has done for us. I’m inviting people from Bulawayo to come and celebrate the birthday and praise the Lord for life and for all he has done for us. The show is for free as I want to minister through music.” The musician has already won a number of awards in his short musical journey and gospel fans will certainly experience his mission.
