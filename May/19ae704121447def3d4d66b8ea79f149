PROPHET Emmanuel Mutumwa Gwandida has lived up to his promise to promote the empowerment of the girl child through education after he paid school fees for five girls in Bulawayo. Last month, during the Easter celebrations at his Johane Masowe eChishanu Apostolic church in Bulawayo’s Selborne Park suburb, Madzibaba Mutumwa said his church advocates for the upliftment of the girl child through education. <img class="size-full wp-image-606666" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mutumwa1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mutumwa1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mutumwa1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prophet Mutumwa  “The doctrine that women and girls should not be afforded the same opportunities as men and boys is false and chauvinistic. We are all made in the image of God and as such time and chance belongs to us all under the sun. I believe girls should go to school and compete on an equal footing with boys. The days of confining women to the kitchen are over. That is why I have decided to pay school fees for some girls in Bulawayo,” said Madzibaba Mutumwa. In an interview yesterday, the Apostolic sect leader said he has honoured his word. “I have already paid school fees for five girls and one boy who is doing early childhood development at Khumalo Primary School. One of the girls is at Sacred Heart Girls High and she is doing form 1, the other is doing Form 3 at David Livingstone High School and another is in Form 1 at Mpopoma High School. Two are at primary level, there is one at Masiyephambili Junior School and the other at Emakhandeni Primary School,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606664" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Prophet-Mutumwa-leads-prayers-at-his-church-e-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Prophet-Mutumwa-leads-prayers-at-his-church-e-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Prophet-Mutumwa-leads-prayers-at-his-church-e-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Madzibaba Mutumwa said educating girls leads to the accelerated development of the country. “There is more to gain from girls going to school. There is no advantage in discriminating against women. Educating girls results in rapid development and reduces maternal and infant mortality and HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases. “It strengthens the economy and reduces inequality as women contribute to development. Countries that empower women have higher growth. For Zimbabwe to prosper and to achieve its development goals, it needs women to be at the same level as men. There is no other way,” said Madzibaba Mutumwa. Madzibaba Mutumwa believes that women and girls with access to education are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.  “When girls go to school, they are taught the importance of self-care and self-esteem. Women and girls who go to school know their rights and they know what is wrong and right. They do not rely on men as they are empowered to be independent. They are able to report sexual crimes against them. “The reason women and girls get abused a lot is poverty. Take away poverty and women and girls will defend themselves against men. Education is the best way to end domestic violence,” he said.
