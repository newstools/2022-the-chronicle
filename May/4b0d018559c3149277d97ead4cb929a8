The Chronicle It’s a milestone! 60 Years of Baking “The Best Of The Best”. The origins of the Company The family-owned Proton Bakers was established in Marondera some 60 years ago. The bakery was founded by Peter Tselentis, born on the Greek Island of Kefalonia. He left Greece at the age of thirteen to find employment to assist his family who could not make ends meet. Peter arrived in Zimbabwe in 1947 and worked for several bakeries in Harare where his entrepreneurial spirit was driving his passion for work. In 1947 Peter left Harare to settle in Marondera where he worked for the Model Bakery which was owned by the Vandoros brothers, Anthony and Gerasimos, who also owned a general dealing company. After working at The Model Bakery for four years Peter was approached to run a new bakery, Mutare Bakery for the Zambelis family.  While waiting for Mutare Bakery to be completed in 1951, Peter found employment at the original London Bakery in Rezende Street, where he worked as a baker and confectioner. In 1953 the Vandoros brothers recognised Peter’s entrepreneurial spirit and gave him the opportunity to rent Model Bakery from them. He left Mutare Bakery to settle in Marondera. Peter ran the business very successfully for a couple of years before he offered to buy out the Vandoros brothers and become sole owner of Model Bakery. In time, Peter would buy out Standard Bakery situated in Marondera as well. Running the bakery was hard during those difficult days – there were shortages of plant equipment and raw materials. Suppliers such as Rhodesian Milling (National Foods Limited) were supportive of Peter’s business, as were many other suppliers. Strong relationships and loyalty were formed and are still in place to this day. The entrepreneurial flair remains in the new generation of the Tselentis family with Peter’s vast experience as a strong foundation cascaded to the new generation of management led by Gerry, and Spiros Tselentis. <img class="size-full wp-image-596179" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/national-foodss.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/national-foodss.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/national-foodss-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Foods Limited The organisational structure has also revolved to adjust to the current business environment.
