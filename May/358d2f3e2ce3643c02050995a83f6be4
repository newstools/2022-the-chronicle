The Chronicle Wedding of . . . Gregory Muzanechita, the first-born son of the late Mr CT and the late Mrs V Muzanechita of Zimunya, Mutare and Maggie Tshuma, the last daughter of the late Mr ST and the late Mrs S Tshuma of Chivi. Tied the knot on . . . April 18, 2022. We chose . . . Green Gardens in Bulawayo for our wedding ceremony and reception because of its beautiful scenic views. How did you meet? We met in Gweru in 2015. We became friends from then and in 2017, I proposed to her. In 2018, we got engaged and in 2019, I paid lobola. <img class="alignnone wp-image-610701 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-50-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-50-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-50-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Did you face any challenges planning the wedding? The major challenges we faced were coming up with the guest list because we had to limit our numbers yet both of our families are big, not to mention church members, friends and colleagues. Covid-19 was our worst nightmare as it posed a huge threat to our wedding in 2020. Because of lockdown restrictions, we kept postponing till 2022 when we finally made it happen. Wedding colours . . . coral peach and gold. My wedding dress . . . was a princess wedding ball gown that was provided by Mrs Mutasa Boutique. The bridal team . . . was a 24-member one with six bridesmaids, six groomsmen, six mini brides and six mini grooms. The cake . . . was a five-tier fruit cake baked by Mrs Terry Shiridzinomwa. <img class="alignnone wp-image-610705 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-51-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-51-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-51-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> My favourite part of the wedding . . . was the arrival of the bride and watching the bride walking down the aisle. Listening to our Apostle S Mathe teaching with such wisdom was also amazing. The most touching moment . . . was when we exchanged our vows. The most touching speech . . . was when he promised to love and support me in front of my relatives. Guest-list . . . 100 Photography . . . was provided by Millan. Budget . . . We’d rather not say. Honeymoon . . . We went to Victoria Falls.
