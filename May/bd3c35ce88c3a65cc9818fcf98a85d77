At least one woman, but there could be more.” Current Cosafa president Phillip Chiyangwa has indicated he will not stand for a second term. <img class="size-full wp-image-608746" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-17-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-17-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-17-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cosafa president Phillip Chiyangwa He was elected president of Cosafa in December, 2016 after standing unopposed at the organisation’s annual meeting in South Africa. He took over from Suketu Patel, who elected not to stand, after completing two terms in office. It had also become clear, at the time of the polls Patel had lost the backing of the regional football leaders amid winds of change, which were sweeping across African football.  South African football boss, Danny Jordaan, had also entertained dreams of fighting for the Cosafa presidency but withdrew, just before the vote. –@innocentskizoe
