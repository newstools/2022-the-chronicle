To ensure that the hip-hop genre does not die, a weekly Hip-Hop Power Session was introduced in Bulawayo two months ago with artistes and poets flexing their creative side on stage every Thursday evening at Red Café. Hip-hop is a culture that has transcended borders, cultures and identities, and in Zimbabwe, Bulawayo has arguably become its spiritual home. In keeping with that spirit, these sessions have been a space for emerging and established artistes and their enthusiastic fans since March. Red Café continues to be the only spot in town where hip-hop enthusiasts are guaranteed live performances on a consistent basis. Last week spelled episode 11 of the sessions. It was a special “Ladies Night” edition hosted by Nokubonga Majenda and featured scintillating performances from Stewie LeSavage, Sativa Lyrical Picasso and Noluntu J. According to host and co-organiser BilliusTheMajestic, the night was dedicated to “highlighting the amazing female talent, Bulawayo music and art boasts in general.” <img class="wp-image-613248 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rockie DoUb performing at the hip hop sessions The session opened with a passionate spoken word performance from Stewie LeSavage who roused the crowd with her poems Black Girl and Black Woman, celebrating and affirming black womanhood. Next to grace the stage was multi-talented artiste Sativa Lyrical Picasso, exciting the audience with an animated and sensual performance of her songs Everything to You and Running featuring Rascal M (whose verse she rapped effortlessly as if it were her own). Her performance made full use of the stage and incorporated dance and theatrics that had the crowd swooning. <img class="wp-image-613432 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Red cafe  The floor was then opened up to the ladies to do Karaoke for a prize of makeup from Kiki and a photoshoot from Lulu Blakk. The winner was a young lady named Shotty who graced the stage for the first time with an emotional and crowd-pleasing performance of Alessia Cara’s Scars to your Beautiful.  The last performance was from formidable female artiste Noluntu J. The RoilBAA and Zim Hip-Hop award nominee calmly demolished her set, wowing the crowd with her rapid-fire flow and confident bars and metaphors. The seasoned rapstress had the crowd chanting along to her songs Moko, Dlozi lam, eKasi Lam and Ndlunkulu. What surprised the crowd was a freestyle performance at the tail end of the show from seasoned rapper P.O.Y, courtesy of Red Café owner Babongile Sikhonjwa. The wordsmith floated over a boom-bap beat, bringing the show to a close. <img class="wp-image-613249 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stewie Le Savage With growing pains showing occasionally, the growth is definitely visible, as was proven by the support to this latest episode. As the Ladies’ Night went to show, the founders and organisers Brintz, FaRai, and BilliusTheMajestic intended to make it a space for diverse hip-hop artistes to showcase and sharpen their performance skills. “What started out as a platform that sought to include the marginalised hip-hop artistes in the city has done not only that but has begun to take many different forms. Its continued evolution is something to marvel at,” said co-founder FaRai. Brintz said his team has been working on diversifying content and personnel for the sessions. “Hip-hop artistes now have a home that welcomes them to celebrate their art form unapologetically in the city. The show is growing to be an all-inclusive platform for hip-hop lovers from all walks of life,” he said.
Sikhonjwa reminisced on his days as a young rapper. He said his support of the power sessions is to bypass the challenges his generation faced. “When we were younger, we didn’t have a platform to showcase our talents. I’m proud of this concept and I’m liking how it’s getting better every week,” said Sikhonjwa. “What I envisage is getting a sponsor so that people aren’t just showcasing their talents for free,” said Skhonjwa.
FaRai echoed the same sentiments saying music should be a full-time job. “My personal dream is to build this platform to a point where artistes don’t have to have conventional 9-5 jobs and music can be the thing that they do,” said FaRai. <img class="wp-image-596006 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dot.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dot.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dot-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asaph BilliusTheMajestic was excited by the prospect of widening the platform’s reach, saying, “We’re currently working on expanding into the digital media space and finding ways to not only magnify the culture but facilitate the conversation surrounding it.”  Brintz said sustainability would be key if the movement is to grow. “We are now at a point to figure out models on how to make this platform sustainable for every person that contributes to its growth, and in the near future take it nationally and regionally,” said Brintz. Either way, the buzz this show has generated is undeniable. So far, the show has had appearances from many Bulawayo hip-hop luminaries including M.U.S.E, P.O.Y, Luminous, Slickah Beats, Skillz and Def Jam Recordings Africa signee Asaph. The possibilities are endless, but where this platform is actually headed is up to the organisers. There is a need for the public to support one of their own, wait and hope for the best. — @eMKlass
