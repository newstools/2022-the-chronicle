It is a huge honour for me and great recognition for Rhumba music,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611565" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Bakhuzeni hit-maker said the invitation could be an endorsement of his collaboration with South African poet Venda Boy on the song Khumbudzo. His manager Lucky Moyo said they have been working hard to market The Big Boss in the region, something that has seen them working on many collaborations.  Moyo said the invitation also presents an opportunity for them to showcase what Zimbabwe has to offer. “Being invited to perform at this event is a great endorsement. We’re going to fully utilise the opportunity. “Since it is Africa Day, we’re going to open our set with Africa, a song from our early albums, and move on to other tracks like Bakhuzeni. We promise a polished performance that’ll certainly put Zimbabwe on the map,” Moyo said. Martin’s music has certainly taken a new direction with more emphasis on collaborations. Recently, he released an album, Bayadideka, which was a collaboration with various artistes including Sungura ace Mark Ngwazi. He has also done a number of videos, some of which are available on YouTube, with the latest being Inyumbazana, a track from the latest album. –@themkhust
