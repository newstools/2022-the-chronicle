The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau Zanu-PF second secretary Cde Kembo Mohadi has implored members to work hard to ensure that the revolutionary party gets more votes in the next harmonised elections. <img class="size-full wp-image-590823" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ZANU-PF-SUPPORTERS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ZANU-PF-SUPPORTERS.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ZANU-PF-SUPPORTERS-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZANU PF SUPPORTERS He said elections are a huge battleground for the party’s survival. Cde Mohadi said it was critical for Zanu-PF to consolidate its current stronghold on the ground and recruit more members to achieve the envisaged five million votes in the next elections. He was speaking during the official opening of the party’s induction  workshop for Matabeleland South party leaders which is being held in Beitbridge. “We need to recruit more people to the party and encourage them to register as voters and to vote for Zanu-PF,” said Cde Mohadi.  “As a party, our huge task now is to work together, we need everyone from every sector in the country to join Zanu-PF, and that is achievable if we all work together like what I am seeing here today. It is my hope that this induction you are going through, will rekindle a razor-sharp consciousness for an improved way of approaching issues”. He said during elections, every vote counts and hence Zanu-PF should keep growing in numbers from where it is today. Convincing new members to join the revolutionary party, he said, is not a task for one individual, but should be done collectively by all cadres. Cde Mohadi said the National Political Commissariat (NPC) should take a leaf from Matabeleland South and encourage other provincial executives to carry out the induction training, which will see the party emerge stronger. “Such kinds of forums should be held regularly so that we take stock and address issues as we go. In addition, I want to urge those at grassroots leadership to avoid burdening the party’s national headquarters with petty issues which they can resolve at their level,” he said. The veteran politician also advised members of the party’s Youth League to be patient and allow themselves to grow in politics, rather than engaging in unnecessary fights with their elders. <img class="size-full wp-image-608896" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> CDE Border Gezi Cde Mohadi said they should emulate the late Cdes Border Gezi and Elliot Manyika who all were groomed from the youth league to become national political commissars. <img class="wp-image-608898 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-32-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-32-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-32-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> CDE Elliot Manyika “It is also disturbing to hear that Matabeleland South province could possibly lose four of its 13 Parliamentary seats because fewer people are registered as voters. So, let every one of us here get to the ground and mobilise our people to get documented and register as voters. Instead of losing seats, we should be getting more like what has been the trend in previous years,” said the Vice President. He warned some elements  within the ruling party who feel that getting into a position of authority was a ticket to conducting criminal activities in the name of Zanu-PF. — @tupeyo
