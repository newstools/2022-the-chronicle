The Chronicle Romans 12:13
Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. IN every purchase the customer seeks to fulfil a certain need, or satisfy themselves in numerous ways. It is an attempt to solve a problem. Hence you must know that your product is a solution to many and so you must treat it as such. Therefore, always be in touch with your customers’ needs. Run surveys and know that they are missions and strive to improve your products to suit their needs. The law of relationships 149 As a sales person, you must always view yourself as a problem solver. Your target market is always those facing challenges that your product or service can solve. Always bear the customers’ needs in mind and how your product can help them solve their problems. Customers are not interested in you but what you have to offer them in relation to their needs. Always adopt a problem solver attitude.  Perceive yourself as a chemist or pharmacist who cures people’s sicknesses; you have the “drug” that they need in order to feel better. Present your product or service in such a way that the customer feels a need to have it in order to solve their problems. Once you achieve that, the price will not affect the customer, in fact how much it is will become of less importance compared to their need for it. Work on presentations that reveal such areas that increase the value of your product or service. Find out what your current customers are benefiting the most from your products and capitalise on it as you offer more aspects. You must have a way with words. Use words that increase the value of your product. Give the customer information that opens their minds to the benefits and how lucky they are to have come across your product. Matthew 5:16
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven. NIV
