Through her service, she has demonstrated the invaluable role that women play in building trust, advocating for change, and forging peace. “Her example shows how we will all gain with more women at the decision-making table and gender parity in peace operations,” said Mr Guterres. Maj Zharare, who joined the army in 2006 as an Infantry Platoon Commander, while doubling as a matron in Mutare, expressed her appreciation for the honour adding that she has always been an advocate for equal opportunities for both women and men. “Growing up in a patriarchal society where men have always been given preference over women, to eventually see a shift with the turn of the millennium, when countries started focusing on gender mainstreaming, served as motivation for me to work on addressing gender issues. Also, my parents gave us (girls) equal opportunities as my brothers. I believe that equal opportunities should be given to both women and men in all aspects of life,” said Maj Zharare. <img class="wp-image-612108 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Major-Winnet-Zharare-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Major-Winnet-Zharare-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Major-Winnet-Zharare-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Major Winnet Zharare As the Chief Military Information Officer in UNMISS Bentiu field office, Maj Zharare helped ensure that patrols included both women and men to improve protection efforts as well as build trust between host communities and the Mission.  Her efforts also contributed to an increase in gender-aggregated data so that issues raised by local women and girls got attention. “Advocating for gender parity and women’s participation in an environment where they are traditionally excluded from decision-making, she encouraged local civilian and military authorities and community representatives to involve both men and women in meetings with the UN. <img class="wp-image-611652 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-27.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-27.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-27-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> United Nations General Assembly Her diligence and diplomatic skills quickly gained her the trust of local military commanders who would systematically reach out to her on issues pertaining to women’s protection and rights. During her patrols and numerous community engagement initiatives, Major Zharare also successfully encouraged men and women to work together in farming and in the construction of dikes around Bentiu town to alleviate food shortages and prevent further displacement,” reads an extract from peacekeeping.un.org.
