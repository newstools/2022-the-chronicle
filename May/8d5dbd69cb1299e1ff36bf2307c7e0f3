BULAWAYO Chiefs have gone for five consecutive games without defeat and are hoping to carry that momentum into their next Castle Lager Premier Soccer League encounter against Herentals at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow afternoon. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608407" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-37-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-37-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-37-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In their last five games, Chiefs have drawn three times and won twice. They drew against Ngezi Platinum (1-1), Manica Diamonds (0-0) and Highlanders (2-2), while beating Whawha (1-0) and Bulawayo City (1-0). For all their efforts this season, Chiefs have accumulated 18 points and are ninth on the log standings. Herentals are three points ahead of Chiefs and go into Sunday’s game on the back of an impressive goalless draw against title chasing Chicken Inn. Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso knows it will not be an easy assignment against the Harare-based students. “I think it’s going to be a difficult game. Playing in Harare is never easy. From what l understand they are a good side and besides, they are on top of us on the table, which is evidence that they are a good side. We have had a number of injuries in the past weeks and have been able to show that our squad has got depth,” said Terroso “We will look to carry on with the momentum.  We have gone five games unbeaten and our performances have been relatively positive. We need to play even better on Saturday than we did last week. We also need to manage the squad. It’s been a shorter week, having played on Sunday and now we play on Saturday. We also lose the day of travel. We are confident we will go there and play our game. – @innocentskizoe
