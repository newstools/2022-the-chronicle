ZIMBABWE and South Africa are keen to establish synergies in the tourism sector, to enable them to effectively exploit available opportunities in the wider value chain. The country last week participated at the Africa’s Travel Indaba (ATI), which was held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban, South Africa. The event came after two years of absenteeism due to the Covid-19 pandemic. <img class="size-full wp-image-606930" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-2-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-2-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-2-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Africa’s Travel Indaba The giant exhibition was officially opened by South African Minister of Tourism, Lindiwe Sisulu under the theme: “Africa’s Story, Your Successes”. During the tour of the country’s stand earlier, Minister Sisulu had an engagement with Zimbabwean officials during which they discussed “possible synergies between both governments and tour operators in an effort to increase visitor activities and tourism receipts on both sides of the Limpopo”, said the ZTA in a brief shared with the media. The Zimbabwe stand has 27 exhibitors with five newcomers who include; Gateway Stream, Palm River Hotel, Central Air Transport Services and Julian Brookstein. Minister Sisulu also called for the African continent to work collaboratively to drive tourism growth so as to accelerate recovery at regional level.  The call comes as Africa has started witnessing economic benefits from the tourism post-Covid-19 recovery, which is expected to inject immense contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of many nations. Minister Sisulu, said ZTA, also indicated interest in Zimbabwe’s natural heritage, which include the Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Wonders of the world. She pointed out that Zimbabwe had the best view of the Victoria Falls and mentioned that if one visited the Falls and did not experience the showers during their tour, “then you hadn’t quite experienced the beauty of the ‘Smoke that Thunders’”. <img class="size-full wp-image-606934" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  South African Minister of Tourism, Lindiwe Sisulu Commenting on the exhibition, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) acting chief executive, Mr Givemore Chidzidzi, said: “It’s exciting to be exhibiting once again at the ATI and we have new exhibitors at the Zimbabwe stand this year. “We are looking forward to marketing destination Zimbabwe and acquiring new business. At the stand we had tour operators, hoteliers, car rentals, airlines and air charter services all under one roof”. Mr Chidzidzi said the Covid-19 pandemic had dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector, which compelled operators to embrace technology as they held meetings and conferences virtually. <img class="size-full wp-image-606942" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-4-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-4-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-4-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> United Nations Tourism Organisation “However, the world has re-opened, therefore, we need to put our best foot forward and market destination Zimbabwe,” he said. “Concentrating on our hidden gems that need to be packaged and marketed to the world.” United Nations Tourism Organisation (UNWTO)’s director for the regional department of tourism in Africa, Elcia Grandcourt said building trust among travellers was key in rebuilding the economy. <img class="size-full wp-image-606937" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Elcia Grandcourt “We are promoting our work purely on three key pillars, which are sustainability, economic and social aspects,” she said. “We are now living in a world where digitalisation is the go-to form of communication, digital transformation innovation and investment in tourism.” Meanwhile, exhibitors at the ZTA stand have said they were pleased with the business conducted during day one and expressed optimism that new opportunities had been created.
