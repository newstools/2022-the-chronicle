We hit the ground running at the beginning of the pandemic. Remember in March 2020, we had already launched our National Preparedness and Response Plan which was launched by His Excellency. “We specifically put up the Cabinet inter-ministerial taskforce that made sure that we were following the whole of Government, whole of society and everyone on board and all those preparations at the very start of the pandemic made sure that our national response was very strong,” said Dr Mahomva. “We were very clear in terms of the strategies we were guided by World Health Organisation pillars of responding to the pandemic. We have never looked back.” She said the country has navigated through four waves of the pandemic, which have served as a learning curve in case management.  Dr Mahomva said following the strategies that were adopted, Zimbabwe has recorded fewer deaths compared to some well-resourced countries. “You’ll notice that we didn’t get hit by a large number of cases if we compare it to other countries. We also managed to introduce the vaccination programme earlier than anyone in the African continent. As we speak, our vaccination programme remains one of the leading programmes in the African continent. We want to get everybody who is eligible for vaccination,” said Dr Mahomva. She said from the country’s Covid-19 management, there is hope at the end of the tunnel.
