After a three-year hiatus owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chibuku Neshamwari Dance Festival is back with event organisers, Delta Beverages, announcing that the first round of provincial competitions has been slated for May 28. “We are pleased to announce that Chibuku Neshamwari will roar to life on the 28th of May 2022,” wrote Delta Beverages in a statement released yesterday.  Bulawayo traditional dance group, Ezimnyama was the last winner after winning the national competition in 2019, their second win after emerging victorious in 2017. A tripartite partnership between Delta Beverages, the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe, and the Zimbabwe National Traditional Dance Association, the competition that was launched in 1963 has served as a launchpad for the careers of many traditional dance groups. <img class="size-full wp-image-609784" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Delta Beverages “Chibuku Neshamwari has over the years afforded dance groups global recognition and performances at various corporate and cultural events. This festival has become important in promoting and ensuring that traditional dances, which are one of our crucial intangible cultural heritages are celebrated.  “Dance and music have played an important part in the way people interact, celebrate and narrate our past. To this end, Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival has kept alive the many traditional dances that define the country and its people.” Delta Beverages said, as per usual, dance competitions will be conducted across the country’s 10 provinces where participants will be shortlisted to represent their provinces at the national competitions. “The top three winning groups will receive prize monies. This will then culminate in a national final where winners from the 10 provinces will battle it out to be crowned overall winners,” wrote Delta Beverages.  Dates and venues for the provincial and national finals are yet to be unveiled with event organisers saying they will be doing so in due course.
