The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief THE Political Actors Dialogue (Polad) has called for a currency indaba as it seeks to join hands with Government in an effort to find ways to stabilise the exchange rate which is eroding the people’s earnings. President Mnangagwa said at the weekend that Government is putting in place measures   to control the local currency’s rapid depreciation. The Zimbabwean dollar has been losing its value mainly due to manipulation of the exchange rate on the black market, a development that has seen the surge in prices of goods and services. Banks were ordered to stop lending with immediate effect to minimise the amount of money that is prone to abuse for purposes of manipulating the exchange rate. <img class="size-full wp-image-526776" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Trust-Chikohora.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Trust-Chikohora.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Trust-Chikohora-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Polad economic thematic committee chairperson Mr Trust Chikohora Polad economic thematic committee chairperson Mr Trust Chikohora said the currency indaba is expected to be held this month. “As Polad we are calling for an urgent currency indaba in an effort to find solutions to stabilise the exchange rate which continues to gallop on the parallel market.

It is the biggest challenge which the nation is facing right now. The parallel market is now hovering around $400 to US$1. “Pricing is generally pegged on the parallel rate hence the people’s salaries have been eroded,” said Mr Chikohora.  President Mnangagwa has said the renewed assault on the local currency manifesting through the current wave of unjustified price hikes of basic goods and commodities and exchange rate manipulation is another illegal regime change tool being used by the country’s detractors.
