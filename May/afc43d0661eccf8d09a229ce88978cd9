The Chronicle Whatever you truly believe with feeling and passion becomes your reality. Act in a manner consistent with your belief especially belief about yourself. What you experience or see in your life is what you have believed for yourself. If you do not have faith in greatness for your destiny you will never see it, so accept as true, great things for your life and then you will surely witness immensity; free yourself from doubt and fear. Luke 1:30-31: Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS. (NKJV) A man of God stating that you are a multimillionaire, that you are going to conceive multimillionaire status, when you do not even have a dollar in your pocket is the same scenario of the angel telling Mary that she will conceive in her womb and yet she had never met with a man. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605191" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> If the Lord has said yes, then indeed you shall become a multimillionaire! Conception will take place and you will, by your faith, attain that status. A multimillionaire rank is of God and can be released spiritually by His power. Even though you might be penniless, always quote “with God nothing shall be impossible.” Mary became pregnant as the angel spoke and convinced her. As he began speaking at first, he did not see a seed in Mary’s womb because she doubted his word, that is why he continued to speak until she believed and received according to the word of the Lord. Luke 1:38: Then Mary said, “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her. (NKJV)  I think when the angel finally saw the seed of Jesus’ conception which happened when Mary said, “Let it be to me according to your word,” he then departed. You do not become a multimillionaire the day you start counting your first million, but the day you first believe that you are one. You turn out to be what you decide to believe; this is a law for anything that you set your hand to, either a ministry or business. If you can conceive it, you can achieve it.
