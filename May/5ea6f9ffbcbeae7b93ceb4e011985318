CRICKET Australia have released the dates for their three one-day internationals against Zimbabwe set for August.
Zimbabwe initially hoped to play a Test match with Australia, but it couldn’t be inserted into the Chevrons’ tour Down Under due to the Aussies’ busy schedule. Australia will warm up for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a white-ball series in India in September, and a home series against West Indies and England.  Cricket Australia announced an action-packed summer schedule yesterday, with the T20 World Cup on home soil between October 16 and November 13 the standout. While the exact dates of the tour to India have yet to be finalised, Australia will play two matches against West Indies on the Gold Coast and three matches against England in Brisbane and Canberra prior to the 20-over showcase commencing. Before touring Australia in August, Zimbabwe will host Afghanistan in three ODIs and three T20 internationals. The ODIs will be played on June 4, 6 and 9, while the T20Is are set for June 11, 12 and 14 at Harare Sports Club. <img class="size-full wp-image-482252" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Harare-Sports-Club.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Harare-Sports-Club.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Harare-Sports-Club-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Harare Sports Club The series against Afghanistan will give Zimbabwe a chance to salvage their pride, which was battered by Namibia in a five-match T20I in Bulawayo. The Chevrons were so inconsistent with bat and ball and looked nothing like a full ICC member. Should they continue displaying shambolic performances, they risk finding themselves playing only against associate members, as full members wouldn’t want to waste time playing a team that struggles against minnows. Meanwhile, Bulawayo will host the International Cricket Council Men’s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier B in July. The qualifiers will be played at Queens Sports Club and Bulawayo Athletic Club and will be contested by eight countries from July 8-18. <img class="size-full wp-image-609481" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Queens-Sports-Club.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Queens-Sports-Club.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Queens-Sports-Club-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Queens Sports Club Zimbabwe is one of the countries still seeking a place in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup and will be hoping to fill one of the two final slots left. The seven teams heading to Zimbabwe for the qualifiers are Hong Kong, Jersey, Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Uganda and the United States of America.
