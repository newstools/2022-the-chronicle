BOTTOM team Bulawayo City and mid-table side Herentals reminded the title-chasing pair of Dynamos and Chicken Inn of the unpredictability of league match outcomes by frustrating the top two outfit to draws. City and Herentals defied odds heavily staked against them to hold Dynamos 1-1 in Harare and 0-0 in Bulawayo respectively. Few would have given City hope of picking up a point against DeMbare, who went into the weekend game on an eight-match unbeaten run comprising seven wins and one draw against Ngezi Platinum Stars. Before Sunday’s game, Dynamos and City had faced off seven times in league games, with the Harare giants winning five of the duels and drawing once in 2016. But on Sunday, newly appointed City coach Farai Tawachera, who took over from Philani “Beefy” Ncube, marked his first assignment with a big point. His captain Vincent Moyo scored in the last minute of the game to cancel out King Nadolo’s earlier strike. <img class="size-full wp-image-566663" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/kn.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/kn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/kn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> King Nadolo Dynamos were left ruing an 82nd missed penalty by Albert Eonde, whose weak shot was easily saved by City goalkeeper Reward Muza, who is on loan from Highlanders. Dynamos blew a chance to stretch their lead to four points after Chicken Inn had only closed the gap by a point following their goalless draw a day earlier. Just like Dynamos, Chicken Inn had gone into the Herentals game as hot favourites, as they had won three out of their four duels against the Students since breaking into the top-flight league in 2018. Chicken Inn gaffer Joey Antipas was left frustrated and took a swipe at his players for their lack of zeal to win. “First of all, we didn’t do enough to win. It’s definitely two points dropped and it’s frustrating. A very frustrating afternoon, definitely not a positive result,” Antipas fumed. Even Chicken Inn’s leading scorer with eight goals in 14 games Brian Muza couldn’t bring his scoring boots. He fluffed two guilt-edged chances as Herentals held on to their “priceless” point. Third-placed Triangle United also failed to close in on the top two, remaining five points adrift of Dynamos following a 1-1 draw against relegation threatened Tenax CS in Mutare. Tenax occupy the last relegation slot, 15th place, with 14 points. <img class="size-full wp-image-607530" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> City coach Farai Tawachera Manica Diamonds, who are fourth with 24 points, were held to a 0-0 draw by Harare City, in a weekend of draws for the top four. The draws by the top four teams, Dynamos, Chicken Inn and Triangle United and Manica Diamonds, were a blessing in disguise for champions FC Platinum, who moved three places up the table to fifth following a 3-0 mouling of Caps United. FC Platinum leapfrogged Ngezi Platinum Stars, Black Rhinos and Herentals to take their points’ tally to 22 and now trail leaders Dynamos by eight points. Ngezi surrendered fifth position following a 1-1 draw against Black Rhinos. At the tail end, Yadah moved out of relegation into 14th place following a 1-0 win against Cranborne Bullets to take their points to 14. Rodwell Dhlakama started his ZPC Kariba job with a win by edging Whawha 1-0 as they started their survival fight. ZPC Kariba fired Godfrey Tamirepi last week following a string of poor results. ZPC Kariba’s weekend win left them still glued in 16th place with 13 points.
