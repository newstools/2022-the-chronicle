ZIMBABWE is on polio and measles alert following the detection of the vaccine preventable diseases in neighbouring countries, with the World Health Organization projecting possible outbreaks if measures are not taken to speed up vaccination. Vaccine-derived polio, a form of the disease stemming from incomplete vaccination coverage, is more widespread globally, and recent outbreaks in Malawi have sparked concerns about how the Covid-19 pandemic may have hit vaccination coverage. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607239" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/World-Health-Organization.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/World-Health-Organization.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/World-Health-Organization-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The WHO has said in a bid to prevent renewed spread in Africa, almost 70 000 vaccinators will go door-to-door in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, to give all children under 5 the oral polio vaccine in a US$15.7 million campaign funded by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The organisation said many children right now are being left without protection against measles and other vaccine preventable diseases due to Covid-19 induced service delivery disruptions. As a result, the risk of large outbreaks has increased. In 2020, 23 million children missed out on all basic childhood vaccines. That’s the highest number seen since 2009 and 3.7 million more than in 2019. In an interview yesterday, Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Dr John Mangwiro said as the country continues to battle the effects of Covid-19, every parent and guardian should ensure that children are vaccinated against these diseases.  “We know that polio was eradicated in Africa but recently a case was recorded from Malawi so we are on the alert on that as we know we may be affected if action is not taken. We would like to encourage parents and guardians to take children for vaccination. On top of Covid-19, we continue to vaccinate children against all those viral infections and we are committed as Government to ensure no child is left behind,” said Dr Mangwiro. “We need to keep ourselves safe from spreading these infections. If a child gets sick or is feeling unwell let’s rush to health institutions as soon as possible and keep them in a clean environment. As Government, we are on the lookout for those signs and symptoms for those two diseases.” He said although no outbreaks have been recorded in Zimbabwe, the Ministry has made all provisions to detect such cases before they spread. Dr Mangwiro urged members of the public to continue getting inoculated against Covid-19 in the wake of looming lockdowns in other countries. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-596024" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We have heard that cases are rising in other countries hence we should keep our guard on. We have evidence that shows the global pandemic is lethal to those who are unvaccinated hence we urge everyone eligible to get vaccinated,” added Dr Mangwiro. – @thamamoe
