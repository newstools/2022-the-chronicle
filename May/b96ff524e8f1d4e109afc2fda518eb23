After a very successful launch of her “A girl from Harare” tour in Victoria Falls last week, singer and songwriter, Gemma Griffiths is hyped up ahead of her show at The Boundary in Bulawayo today. The artiste who is behind songs, Maita Basa, Titungamire and Ndinewe had an amazing experience in Victoria Falls where she performed at an intimate show for a selected few, VVIP ticket holders of the Victoria Falls Carnival last Friday. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606693" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-26-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-26-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-26-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She shared the stage with her friend, Nutty O with the two serenading crowds on the banks of the Zambezi River with their performance of One Call Away. A day after, she performed on the carnival’s main stage where her singing talent was appreciated by many who visibly enjoyed her set. Her rendition of Winky D’s hit, Musarova Bigman was a hit and certainly earned her a lot of fans. Generally, her music and performance was impressive. Her carnival performance was part of her “A girl from Harare” tour that will see her performing in a couple of cities in the coming weeks. The tour that will see her promote not only her talent, but that of many local artistes she has roped in, could not have commenced at a better time than now when locals are showing interest in consuming their own content. Already, Gemma has whet the appetites of music lovers in Bulawayo with her rendition of Lovemore Majaivana’s Umoya Wam with people in the city now anticipating watching her live in action. Chronicle Showbiz Editor, Melissa Mpofu (MM) caught up with Gemma Griffiths (GG) to find out more about the tour and her plans for the year. MM: Tell us more about A girl from Harare. What inspired this tagline? GG: In 2019, I began a journey, driving across Africa in a Land Rover Defender. The trip stretched for almost two years and I visited 10 countries and covered over 24 000kms. During this time, I wrote music, poetry, stories . . . and a lot of the work attached to my name including this EP (A girl from Harare). The lessons I carried with me from home, the musical wealth of this nation, the openness of our people — all of this became increasingly evident to me as I drove. So as I travelled, experienced new places alone and met new people, I found one thing abundantly clear — all of me, my identity, my strength and my story could be introduced in four words – “a girl from Harare”. <img class="size-full wp-image-581791" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Nutty-O-456.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Nutty-O-456.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Nutty-O-456-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nutty O MM: What are your expectations for the A girl from Harare tour? GG: I am so excited to be starting this epic tour! It will cover Vic Falls, Bulawayo, Gweru, Kwekwe, Mutare, Harare, and Hwange. Myself, my band and an array of incredible Zimbabwean musicians and DJs are going to be bringing the stage to life in these awesome places! It is especially special to me as I am going to be travelling with some of my best friends . . . I will be joined by Nutty O in Mutare and Kwekwe, DJ Tamuka in Gweru and for Bulawayo, there will be Holy Ten, Voltz Jt, Kyla Blac, Murphy Cubic, Boy Nino, MJ Sings, DJ Nospa, Djembe Monks and many more. DJ King Her is the resident DJ for the tour! It is set to be a tour to remember, and we are travelling the whole tour on a pink bus! MM: You had a collaboration with Asaph, what’s your take on Bulawayo artistes and the industry as a whole? GG: Bulawayo has amazing talent! I am always blown away by the innovation and creativity of Bulawayo artistes, and as creatives, they have some serious style. Bulawayo has a vibe of its own and I love it! MM: Having been born in Cape Town, what’s your secret to mastering the Shona language and fluently using it? GG: Although I was born in Cape Town, my parents are Zimbabwean and were living in Zimbabwe, they just happened to be in Cape Town at the time of my birth. So I never grew up there, I grew up at home in Harare. I learnt Shona through my friends, my band and through music. <img class="size-full wp-image-596006" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dot.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dot.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/dot-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asaph MM: You are well-travelled, what has travelling around the world taught you? GG: When you travel, you are a student to the places you are visiting, the people you are meeting, and the cultures you are experiencing. You learn so much about acceptance, the vibrant continent we call home and the amazing amount of good in the world. There is so much out there to be excited about, so many kind souls and beautiful places. Travelling has taught me humility and patience, to allow the place to dictate the speed at which I flow and move. It has also brought me pride for my Zimbabweaness . . .  as when I meet new people, with such an open heart that I grew up with, I am always quick and proud to say I am “A girl from Harare”. <img class="size-full wp-image-606696" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gemma Griffiths (right) with Boity Thulo at the carnival in Vic Falls MM: What has the music industry taught you throughout the years? GG: It has taught me that you can be kind and still win. You can work your way to a dream. It has also taught me to step back every now and then and look at the bigger picture, at the whole picture, and acknowledge my growth. I have made amazing friends in this industry. I have connected with people across the country, and the world through music. Ultimately, I have learnt that music is powerful beyond measure. It transcends barriers of race, age, gender, and nationality. It crosses language barriers, borders and genres… it is universal and yields true healing powers.  MM: You seem to do a lot of cover songs (and excel at it too), what’s behind the covers? GG: I love them. I find it so enthralling to take a piece of music that has inspired me and re-imagine another side to it, another facet of the music. I loved my cover of Musarova Bigman, and how I could tell the girl’s side of the story. MM: You were shortlisted to represent the country in the “Listener’s Choice” category at the 2021 MTV Africa Music Awards, how did that make you feel and from the accolades you have, which one is your best? <img class="size-full wp-image-593118" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Holy-Ten.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Holy-Ten.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Holy-Ten-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Holy Ten GG: That was an amazing feeling. I am glad to say I’ve been blessed with some amazing accolades. I have won four Zimas, a Star FM Award and have been nominated for a number of big awards including the Namas. I don’t know if I could choose one, but to be named Best Female Artist of the Year in the 2019 Zimas was an incredible feeling. MM: Who inspired your musical journey? <img class="size-full wp-image-587907" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/WINKY-D1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/WINKY-D1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/WINKY-D1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Winky D GG: Music itself I think. The feeling that it gives me when I play. I learnt a lot from Baba Tuku, Bob Nyabinde, Andy Brown, Winky and Jah too. . . as well as the jazz greats like Billie Holiday, Etta James and Louis Armstrong. MM: What’s the one thing that people don’t know about Gemma?
GG: I play the trumpet. MM: How does Gemma relax after a hard day’s work? GG: I love tea. I read and do yoga. And being outdoors. I often sit outside in the evenings and just breathe. I feel so much more connected to myself when I am connected to nature. MM: What can we expect from Gemma going forward? GG: This tour! The A girl from Harare tour has been a dream of mine for a long time. We will be travelling, filming and creating as many memories as we can! Make sure to catch a show! 7 May – Bulawayo, 14 May – Kwekwe, 27 May – Mutare, 28 May – Harare and 4 June – Gweru.
