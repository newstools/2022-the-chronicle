PARLIAMENT is expected to, from Monday, start holding 2022 national budget feedback meetings across the country. The consultation meetings will run for five days to give stakeholders an opportunity to give feedback on the implementation of the national budget. Parliament is conducting the budget feedback consultations in line with section 141 of the Constitution. Last November, Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube presented a $927 billion budget in Parliament that was hailed as people- centred. President Mnangagwa later assented to the legislation that operationalised the National Budget. <img class="wp-image-603096 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-1-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-1-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-1-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Anchored on the theme: “Reinforcing Sustainable Economic Recovery and Resilience”, the budget is expected to drive development in Matabeleland region and enhance its contribution to the mainstream economy and job creation.
