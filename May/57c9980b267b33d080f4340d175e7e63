For this one, we had a coach from Kenya as part of the participants,” said Phakamile. “The main reason we’re having these courses is because coaching has evolved and is now science based. ‘We want to instil knowledge along the lines of how to coach scientifically and how to improve performances and develop the different performance determining factors in various events.  “The coaches who attended the course went through all the athletics events and were taught how to introduce all these  events to beginner athletes up to the age of 20 years. “We are actually excited as an association that we have been given an opportunity to develop and equip our coaches with the latest scientific knowledge in coaching,” he said. According to World Athletics, the Level 1 course is aimed at producing qualified youth coaches that will not only be able to train and prepare young children for kids’ athletics competitions (7 to 12-year-olds), but also provide the bridge to real athletics. — @innocentskizoe
