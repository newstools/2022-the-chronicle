KHAMI Maximum prison is the venue for this year’s edition of the “Behind the Walls Chess Tournament” that will be held outside the capital for the first time since its inception in 2017. The two-day competition is part of the offender rehabilitation programme and is framed by the Zimbabwe Chess Federation’s Social Chess Commission. Prison Inmates drawn from all provinces are set to take part in the competition. ZPCS national spokesperson Chief Superintendent Meya Khanyezi said: “The tournament has been running since 2017. However, it was suspended owing to Covid-19. Traditionally it involved prisons mainly from Harare and was held at Harare Central Officers Mess. <img class="wp-image-499620 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Khami-Prison.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Khami-Prison.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Khami-Prison-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khami Prison “We discovered that inmates elsewhere were being short-changed by not taking part in this event hence we decided to spread our wings wider working together with the Zimbabwe Chess Federation.” “The event proved a major success such that it attracted the attention of the World Chess governing body culminating in our invitation to take part in the inaugural Intercontinental Chess Championships for Prisoners where our team emerged number two in the world.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-596024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She went on to say that chess plays a huge role in the rehabilitation of a prisoner. “The idea to take the programme to the country’s 10 provinces was motivated by the desire to make inmates elsewhere benefit from the interaction with other chess players outside of prisons where they get ideas on how to live as law abiding citizens.  “Chess plays a vital role in offender rehabilitation. Like any sporting activity, it has its rules and regulations that should be adhered to. It is our hope that that adherence can translate to observing laws of the land. “Furthermore, chess kills boredom. Inmates engage in the game to pass time and not think about confinement and the challenges it brings,” said Khanyezi. She also made a plea to the business community to chip in through providing hampers for inmates and monetary prizes as well for participants.
