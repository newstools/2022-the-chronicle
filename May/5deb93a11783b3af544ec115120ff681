THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) has challenged the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC)’s decision to nullify its January executive committee elections. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612732 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-43-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-43-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-43-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In the letter, BUZ lawyers Sengweni Legal Practice gave the SRC a seven-day ultimatum to settle the issue out of court. SRC last week announced nullification of the Buz election results and ordered fresh polls, citing gross irregularities in the union’s electoral process. SRC stated that the Buz constitution does not provide for National Association of Primary Heads (Naph) and National Association of Secondary Heads (Nash) voting rights, which automatically voids the two organisation’s votes. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612735 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-44-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-44-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-44-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Buz, however, disputes the SRC’s decision. “The manner in which you reached your decision is grossly unprocedural in that it violates the rules of natural justice, the audi alteram partem rule which affords every person a right to be heard before an administrative decision is made against them. “You have decided on issues you did not afford our client a chance to defend or explain. Without hearing our client’s version, you made a finding that conflicts logic and is not supported by the Buz constitution,” reads the Buz lawyers’ letter to the SRC. “To be specific, nowhere in the Buz constitution is it mentioned that Naph and Nash or any member such as them has no voting rights.  You failed to point at specific provisions violated by our client in the constitution because there is no such violation. It is also worth noting that Naph and Nash have been members for over a decade and enjoyed voting rights in at least three elections under your supervision. It is therefore shocking how suddenly you are now of the standing that they cannot vote when you have allowed them the same rights for years.” Buz feels undone by the SRC’s move to nullify its polls and accuses unnamed individuals within the supreme sports body’s ranks of harbouring a vendetta against the basketball union. <img class="alignnone wp-image-416409 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/basketball.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="389" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/basketball.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/basketball-360x206.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “There has to be some sort of procedure that the SRC follows that is clear to all interested persons. Our client is still of the firm view that this issue can be resolved amicably without the need of involving the courts,” the lawyers wrote. The elections in dispute were held at Mtshabezi High School in Matabeleland South on January 29. Incumbent Buz president Joe Mujuru was re-elected after seeing off the challenge of David Pick in a closely contested race that went into a tie breaker. Charmaine Chamboko also retained her position of secretary-general, beating Sunny Mbofana and Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu. Tonderai Shasha was elected technical commission president, while the competitions commission post went to Gideon Chikopa. Taurai Chitsinde was elected head of the athletes’ commission, with the women and youth commission post going to Jacqueline Chironga. – @innocentskizoe
