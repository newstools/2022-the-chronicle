Mashonaland West accounted for most of the offences with 31 followed by Matabeleland South at 22 and Mashonaland East accounting for 17 dockets. A total of 677 tickets were issued to property owners and farmers for failing to put in place standard fire management measures. The fire season stretches from July 31 to October 31.  The 2021 fire season came at the backdrop of a normal to above normal rainfall season in the 2020/21 season. This meant there was more biomass and the country was therefore classified under extreme fire risk. In a statement, Ema director general, Mr Aaron Chigona said veld fires continue to negatively affect strategic infrastructure in the agriculture, tourism and communication sectors. “The 2021 fire season came at the backdrop of a normal to above normal rainfall season in the 2020/21 rainfall season leading to high fire risk of 65.2 percent and extreme fire risk of 24.7 percent of the country respectively. Fire monitoring revealed that 3 948 fire incidences were recorded burning 1 033 722.86 ha of land during the fire season,” he said. “The agency responded to this information by producing an all-inclusive fire management plan for the year, upscaling issuing of orders and increasing awareness campaigns. <img class="size-full wp-image-608532" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-15-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-15-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-15-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ministry Of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Strategic collaborations between the Ministry Of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement and the Ministry of Environment, Climate Tourism and hospitality industry were established. The comprehensive and robust engagements done were aimed at protecting the agricultural produce (crops and animals) and agricultural equipment.” Mr Chigona said the Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry was working on new legislation to govern the fire season in light of climate change and climate variabilities. <img class="wp-image-608536 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-16-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-16-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-16-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry He said the agency is working on upscaling its partnership with relevant stakeholders including the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement and traditional leaders so as to reduce the impacts of fires in the agricultural sector. Mr Chigona said the agency required US$6 million for fire management activities which include effective capacitation of communities and fire fighting structures. The funding is required to cater for hay baling programmes that need tractors equipped with rakers, balers and trailers. It will also help in securing fire fighting equipment. He said the agency will upscale collaborations with line ministries and traditional leaders, judiciary and the police to ensure there is a reduction in fire incidences and impacts. — @DubeMatutu
