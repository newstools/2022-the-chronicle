PUBLIC engagements with the Zifa Restructuring Committee, whose mandate is to reform the troubled football landscape, will start in Harare on Thursday. In an invitation to the public, the restructuring committee said the first engagement forum will be held on May 26 at the National Sports Stadium, with Bulawayo set to host the second meeting on June 14. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611284 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The committee encouraged the public to participate in the engagements, which are part of a process that will lead to the publication of a strategic report outlining a forward-looking plan for developing football in Zimbabwe. The public has also been urged to email their submissions to zifarestructuring@gmail.com or drop their copies at the committee’s National Sports Stadium offices. The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) gave the restructuring committee a year to complete the mission and come up with a blueprint widely expected to chart a new and refreshing chapter for local football.  Already, the committee has had consultations with the Zifa secretariat, Premier Soccer League, Zimbabwe Soccer Coaches association (Zisca), Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (Fuz), Zimbabwe Women’s Soccer League and Mighty Warriors’ technical team, among others. The SRC set up the committee in December last year to tackle matters of a strategic nature, as outlined in their terms of reference, in line with the provisions of Section 21, 19(b), and 20 (c) of the SRC Act. <img class="wp-image-611287 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Anna Mguni Harare lawyer Blessing Rugara leads a nine-member committee that includes former Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) chief executive officer and World Rowing development manager Anna Mguni and  international sports expert Tommy Sithole. – @ZililoR
