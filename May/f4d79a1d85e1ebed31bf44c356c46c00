CENTRAL Region Soccer League (CRSL) championship pacesetters Sheasham should brace for a tough assignment when they play host to Beitbridge side Dulibadzimu United at Gweru Sports Club this afternoon. Sheasham top the table with 35 points, five ahead of second placed former Premiership side TelOne who are away at lowly placed Bishopstone. The table toppers face a Dulibadzimu side that has picked up four points in the two second half of the season matches just like them. Dulibadzimu drew 1-1 away at third-placed Vubachikwe a fortnight ago when Sheasham were awarded three points on a 3-0 scoreline after walking over Filabusi United and last weekend the Beitbridge side edged FC Platinum Under-19s 1-0 at the border town. Sheasham drew 0-0 with TelOne in a Gweru derby last weekend to maintain their grip at the top of the table.
Despite enjoying 12 points over Dulibadzimu, Sheasham are wary of their opponents. <img class="wp-image-610747 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-57-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-57-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-57-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dulibadzimu John Nyikadzino, Sheasham coach, wants his charges to fully concentrate on the match as they want to take their unbeaten run to 16. “Every game is difficult and requires a different approach. We are not reading much to being at the top of the table because the championship is a marathon and our focus is on taking each game as it comes. Dulibadzimu are a tricky outfit and we expect a good, tough game. It won’t be an easy game and we’re primed for a demanding afternoon,” said Nyikadzino.  Sheasham will pin their hopes on former national Under-20 midfielder Pride Ziwengwa, ex-Bantu Rovers defender David Mangezi, utility player Tatenda Mapiye and 23-year-old striker Liberty Masaure who has banged nine goals in 14 games as well as former Chicken Inn winger Physwell Madhazi. Dulibabzimu bank on captain Leeroy Nduzo Rukuda who is an anchorman, former national Under-17 striker Merciful Gusheru with two goals and ex-Sheasham right back Forward Makambanga.
