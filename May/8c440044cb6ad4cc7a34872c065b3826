HIGHLANDERS yesterday evening confirmed the firing of head coach Mandla Mpofu and his backroom staff as first reported by Chronicle Sport. Mpofu, first assistant coach Bekithemba Ndlovu, goalkeepers’ trainer Julius Ndlovu and welfare manager Vezigama Dlodlo were verbally informed of their sacking by Highlanders’ chairman Johnfat Sibanda at the club’s offices after Tuesday morning’s gym workout. Second assistant coach Joel Luphahla, who survived the sack, took charge of the team’s training session at White City Stadium for the second day running yesterday. <img class="size-full wp-image-595710" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-1-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bekithemba Ndlovu In a statement, Bosso said they had amicably parted ways with Mpofu and his backroom staff. “This decision is informed by the team’s unsatisfactory performance, which has resulted in the team sitting on unfamiliar position on the log. We would like to thank Mpofu and his staff for their selfless contribution to our club, and we will cherish all the memories. We wish them all the best in their future endeavours. “In the interim, Joel Luphahla will be conducting the team training sessions, pending the announcement of the new technical team,” the Highlanders statement reads. A club official told Chronicle Sport yesterday that the delay in official communication was caused by their search for a new coach, which is about to be completed. <img class="size-full wp-image-609825" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-52-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-52-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-52-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joel Luphahla “Ideally the news was not meant to leak to the media, as a number of things were still being wrapped up. As it stands, the sacked coaches have not been given their dismissal letters so it is a bit premature to make any announcement,” said the official. The official also revealed that a blunder was made in firing Dlodlo using the same reason of the team’s poor performance to dismiss the coaches because he is not involved in technical issues. Dlodlo’s contract specifically stipulates that he must not interfere with the work of the technical staff and hence the reason advanced for firing him falls away, according to the club official.  His sacking might be reversed in what would be a hugely embarrassing climbdown by Bosso’s executive committee, as questions will be asked why no one first went through his contract before relieving him of his duties. The prolonged silence by Bosso sparked speculation that the club either wants to bring back former head coach Kelvin Kaindu or is talking to South African Gavin Hunt, who have both been previously linked with the job when Mpofu’s struggles with the team were still in their infancy at the beginning of the season. Bosso reportedly approached Hunt, but balked at his wage demands then. <img class="size-full wp-image-602524" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KELVIN-KAUD.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KELVIN-KAUD.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KELVIN-KAUD-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Former Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu Hunt is currently unattached after being sacked by Kaizer Chiefs and Chippa United for poor results in the South African Premiership. The South African previously showed interest in coaching the senior national team, the Warriors. Hunt has also been linked with the SuperSport United job, which was left vacant by the firing of Zimbabwean Kaitano Tembo.
Kaindu was also approached for the Bosso job and although nothing materialised then, sources say the Zambian has been inquiring about the situation at the club. With reports suggesting that the hunt for Mpofu’s replacement has been reduced to one name, it will be no surprise if Kaindu or Hunt are appointed imminently. <img class="size-full wp-image-588260" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-33-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-33-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-33-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Johnfat Sibanda Whoever is appointed has a tough ask to change the side’s fortunes on the field of play.
Bosso have so far won three games, drawn seven and lost three times, leaving them in 13th place on the league table with 16 points. The outcome of two other matches against Dynamos and FC Platinum that were abandoned due to crowd trouble will be decided in the boardroom. – @innocentskizoe
