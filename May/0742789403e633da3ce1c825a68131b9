AFTER dislodging Dynamos from the top of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League table following their 1-0 win over Caps United in Harare, Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas is demanding consistency from his players in their charge for the league title. Brett Amidu’s goal condemned Caps United to their fourth consecutive loss, while Chicken Inn secured three points after two consecutive draws against Highlanders (1-1) and Herentals (0-0). <img class="size-full wp-image-599638" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas The Gamecocks took their points’ tally to 31, one above Dynamos, whose game against Highlanders was abandoned in stoppage time with Bosso leading 1-0. Antipas was happy that they managed to grind a slender 1-0 win, saying Caps United put up good resistance, with their goalkeeper Tatenda Munditi making brilliant saves that kept the score line respectable. Now that they are back to winning ways and left with two games before the halfway mark, Antipas wants consistency. Chicken Inn take on relegation threatened Yadah, who were beaten 2-0 at home by champions FC Platinum, in their next game, before wrapping up their first-half of the season away at championship dark-horses Triangle United.  “We had a confidence blip when we lost 3-0 to Whawha, then narrowly won 1-0 against Bulawayo City before playing to draws against Highlanders and Herentals. It was important that we win against Caps United so that we rebuild our confidence as we head to the halfway. What I believe will be key in our title race is being consistent in getting positive results because in the second-half of the season teams will beef up and will be much stronger. “We’ve shown consistency before, but we need to believe in ourselves, improve on individual performances and become more confident because at times we rush our play and lose the ball. We also have to be more mature in our game and shouldn’t panic and make mistakes. If we manage to address those issues and believe in ourselves, I know that on any good day we can beat anyone in the league,” said Antipas. Chicken Inn have quality and depth in their squad to beat any challenger. They have experienced goalkeeper Donovan Bernard, who played for the Under-20, Under-23 and the senior national teams. <img class="size-full wp-image-609417" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Donovan-Bernard.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Donovan-Bernard.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Donovan-Bernard-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Former Ngezi goalkeeper Donovan Bernard now playing for Chicken Inn. Image taken from Nehanda Radio Antipas applauded his defence led by veteran Moses Jackson that has Nielson Ketala, Itai Mabhunu and Xolani Ndlovu for a disciplined show against Caps United. This is an experienced quartet that has developed telepathy in its play. They also boast a formidable midfield made up of Amidu, George Majika, Clive Dzingai, Richard Hachiro and Shephard Mhlanga, with leading scorer Brian Muza, Marlvin Hwata and Brighton Ncube leading their attack. They have also acquired the services of their former gunman Clive Augusto, who is expected to play a key role in the second-half of the campaign. <img class="size-full wp-image-603808" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-45-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-45-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-45-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Brian Muza Third-placed Triangle United moved to within three points of Chicken Inn after dismissing visiting Cranborne Bullets 5-2 on Sunday. Triangle now sit on 28 points from 15 games and next face champions FC Platinum who moved a place up the table into fourth with 25 points. FC Platinum toppled Manica Diamonds, who drew 0-0 with Black Rhinos. Benjani Mwaruwari’s Ngezi Platinum Stars romped to an emphatic 4-0 win over Tenax CS FC. Ngezi are now sixth with 24 points; six behind Chicken Inn and remain within touching distance of the chasing perk.
