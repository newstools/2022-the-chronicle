The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Chronicle Reporter IRRIGATION schemes in Matabeleland South recorded an increase in production during the 2021/2022 summer cropping season, a development which has been attributed mainly to their rehabilitation. During the 2020/21 season the province recorded an output of 12 000 tonnes under maize while a total of 16 000 tonnes has been recorded out of the 2021/22 season. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-612181" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-87.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-87.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-87-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> 1 500 hectares was planted under maize crop during the 2020/21 season while over 2 000 was planted under the 2021/22 season. The province is targeting 2 800 under winter wheat while less than 2 000 was planted last winter season. An output of 14 000 tonnes is expected this year compared to 10 000 tonnes that was recorded last year. Government working with various partners is rehabilitating irrigation schemes that have been lying idle in Matabeleland South Province, to improve food and nutrition security and ensure attainment of Vision 2030. Under the Second Republic, Government is prioritising the revival of the agricultural sector through the development of irrigation schemes to alleviate food insecurity and poverty particularly in rural communities. <img class="wp-image-612183 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-88.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-88.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-88-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Agriculture A number of schemes that had been lying idle have been revived while some that were being underutilised have been capacitated and expanded. Investors through partnerships with local farmers have also assisted with resources and equipment to enhance underutilised irrigation schemes. Government has also rolled out various schemes meant to transform subsistence agriculture at household level into commercial agriculture. Managers have been deployed to irrigation schemes across the country to maximise production thereby ensuring food security and nutrition.  Irrigation schemes that have been rehabilitated include Tshikwalakwala Irrigation Scheme in Beitbridge which had been grounded for the past 15 years, Sebasa Irrigation Scheme in Gwanda which had been lying idle for several years, Guyu-Chelesa Irrigation Scheme in Gwanda, Moza Irrigation Scheme in Bulilima which was underutilised and Artherstone Irrigation Scheme in Gwanda among others. Other irrigation schemes that are set to be rehabilitated include Silalatshani, Makwe, Mankonkoni, Rustlers, Bambanani and Makwe Irrigation Schemes. In an interview Matabeleland South acting provincial agricultural director, rural development services, Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu said the scale of production in the province and variety of products had improved. “The scale of production in the province has improved following the rehabilitation of several irrigation schemes. During the 2020/21 summer season the province had 1 500 hectares under maize crop in irrigation schemes while over 2 000 was planted under the 2021/22 season. We are targeting to put 2 800 hectares under wheat compared to 2 000 hectares that we had last year. The irrigation schemes are doing well and so are the solar-powered gardens that have been established in the province,” he said. “Interventions coming from Government and various partners will go a long way in developing the province’s agricultural sector. Already we have lucerne being produced at Artherstone Irrigation Scheme and paprika at Moza Irrigation Scheme. Farmers are now running their irrigation schemes on a different level. Their activities are now commercially oriented.” He said intensified farmer training programmes have also helped to increase production. Mr Ndlovu said farmers were also concentrating on growing crops that had a ready market.  – @DubeMatutu
