LOCALLY-distilled brand, Bantu Royal Gin has gained traction in recent weeks as it has been ever-present at events in Bulawayo. The Yanos Fest and the Meet and Grill are some of the events where patrons have enjoyed the gin. Bantu Royal Gin was an official sponsor at the Flowfest held at the Crystal Nightclub last Saturday with local celebrities like Asaph, M.U.S.E and POY celebrating it with patrons. Established in 2020, the gin has been giving strong competition to foreign-distilled liquor brands as locals are resorting to the locally-produced brand. Distilled by Comrades Beverages in Bulawayo, Bantu Royal Gin was first introduced through a mobile cocktail bar that would be set up at most local events and due to its demand, it is now being found at nightclubs and other places of entertainment. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608748" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/IKF.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/IKF.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/IKF-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Gin is a brainchild of events management company Imicimbi Ka Fofo (IKF). In an interview, IKF founder and CEO, Fortune Mguni said he is happy that locals are embracing the product. “Bantu Royal Gin was established for the local people and it gives me great pleasure to see how much they love and support something of their own. Most of the time, people prefer foreign products, but Bulawayo has supported us since 2020,” Mguni said. He further noted that IKF is on a drive to challenge the status quo with its wide range of products and services. <img class="size-full wp-image-608754" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bantu-Royal-Gin.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bantu-Royal-Gin.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bantu-Royal-Gin-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bantu Royal Gin “As Imicimbi Ka Fofo, our mandate is to improve the industry through the provision of top-drawer products and services. Slowly but surely, we’re becoming patrons’ favourite gin. We’re committed to bringing a positive twist to how things are done in the events management fraternity.”  Mguni said IKF wants to take a holistic approach to entertainment so they also specialise in event planning and coordination and offer artist management and promotion. He said working with local artistes has been a charm. “Since we’re all about identifying, nurturing, promoting and introducing new talent to the mainstream industry, working with Kidthrill, Prosine, 5iver and Rebellious Suhnz among other artistes, has been magical,” he said. – @eMKlass_49
