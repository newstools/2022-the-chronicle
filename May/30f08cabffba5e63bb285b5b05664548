The workshop comes as vast sums of money are available for productive investments in emerging markets, but due to regulatory bottlenecks “this capital is not flowing to where it is most needed”. The workshop will thus explore how public-private collaboration can accelerate the scale and impact of investment in emerging markets.  Another event where President Mnangagwa will participate is a roundtable on Restoring Peace and Order amid intensifying geopolitical fractures undoing progress on key global goals. Mid-morning, the President will attend another informal gathering of world economic leaders roundtable discussion on “Resilience for Sustainable Growth”. The discussion, to be attended by political and economic leaders alone, without the media, will focus on the conflict in Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic and the effects of climate change on the “brittle nature of food systems, global supply chains and energy networks”. Participants are expected to come up with steps necessary to build greater resilience at both the global and national levels. Speaking ahead of tomorrow’s packed programme, Stuart Comberbach, Zimbabwe’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations and other international organisations in Geneva, Switzerland, said the WEF is a very important forum for Zimbabwe and the fact that Zimbabwe was invited means it is being recognised among the international community of nations. He said the WEF is not for speeches, “which are actually actively discouraged”, but interactive discussions that proffer strategies and solutions. The whole idea is to allow participants to be very open and honest on the challenges being faced globally and what can be done to address them, according to Ambassador Comberbach.
