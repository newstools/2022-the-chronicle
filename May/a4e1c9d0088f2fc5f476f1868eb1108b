THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) will from June 1, enforce the inspection of imported goods at all entry points to ensure compliance with the Consignment Based Conformity Assessment (CBCA).  Under the CBCA programme, all products regulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce imported into Zimbabwe are expected to be accompanied by a CBCA certificate. Importers have therefore been urged to fully abide by the requirements that are geared to curb the influx of sub-standard products, Ministry of Industry and Commerce Permanent Secretary, Dr Mavis Sibanda said last week. “1 June, 2022 marks the commencement date for the full implementation of the new (CBCA) programme in Zimbabwe,” Dr Sibanda said in a speech read on her behalf by the deputy director of Quality Assurance in Bulawayo, Mrs Mary Chingonzoh. <img class="alignnone wp-image-467899 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Zimra-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Zimra-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Zimra-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) will be enforcing the full implementation of this programme at all ports of entry. I appeal to our importers of goods to abide by the requirements of the CBCA programme.” Dr Sibanda said imported products that are not subjected to inspection have the potential to cause danger to the health of unsuspecting consumers. Under the General Goods category, Dr Sibanda said goods listed under SI 124 OF 2020, which include medicaments, electrical and children’s toys, will be inspected by Bureau Veritas and Cotecna Inspection SA before they are shipped to the country. <img class="wp-image-610981 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cotecna Inspection SA Goods not meeting the international, regional and local standards will be denied entry into the country, she said.
Bureau Veritas and Cotecna Inspection SA have been tasked to inspect Consolidated Consignments, which consist of small consignments of various products that have been consolidated into one cargo or ship through a registered or non-registered consolidator. The enhanced CBCA programme came about following a successful review of the earlier programme, which was made possible with the incorporation of sentiments from the business sector, regulators, Government and quasi-Government departments, said Dr Sibanda.
