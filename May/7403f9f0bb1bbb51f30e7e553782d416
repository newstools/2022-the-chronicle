Despite the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ambassador Shava said Zimbabwe registered highest diaspora remittances. “It’s interesting to note that Diaspora remittances during the Covid-19 pandemic surpassed the US$1 billion mark,” he told the gathering. “This is a clear testimony that our diaspora remains a critical component of national development, not only in remittances but also as our brand ambassadors. “The part they play in convincing their business partners to invest in Zimbabwe and in Zimbabwean products cannot be underestimated.” Official statistics indicate that diaspora remittances clocked about US$1,4 billion last year while many Zimbabweans abroad are more than eager to invest in different sectors of the economy <img class="size-full wp-image-602851" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay This year’s ZITF Diplomats Forum, which was held under the theme: “Advancing Economic Diplomacy for National Development” and attracted several captains of industry and commerce who used the platform to share diverse trade perspectives.

It acts as a multi-lateral medium that brings together the Government, diplomats accredited to the country and business players.  The meeting sought to advance the Second Republic’s agenda of engagement and re-engagement, at a time when international trade is picking up from the effects of Covid-19. As such, Amb Shava said through the National Development Strategy (NDS1), the Government was implementing programmes and policies that convince international investors in line with the mantra: “Zimbabwe is Open for Business”, as there are many trade opportunities to invest in. “There are vast opportunities in sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, mining, services, tourism, infrastructural development, energy and power development, sanitation and housing. “These range from micro enterprises, small to medium enterprises up to conglomerates with special considerations to those who would establish their facilities in small towns, growth points and rural areas,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-594958" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Judith-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Judith-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Judith-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Judith Ncube “Thereby developing the communities that are sources of the resources under exploitation is critical.
