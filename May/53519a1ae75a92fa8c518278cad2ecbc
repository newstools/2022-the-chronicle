Lasker’s experience in the film industry qualifies him for the job at hand. Among his works are Raised by Wolves, Vagrant Queen and Abraham Lincoln. Now in its third edition, the BIOSKOP! Short Film Competition is held under the European Film Festival (EUFF) Zimbabwe. EUFF, one of Zimbabwe’s leading film industry events will this year be held under the theme “Shifting Perceptions”. Last week, EUFF Zimbabwe extended an invitation to Zimbabwean filmmakers based in Zimbabwe and those abroad to submit content for the third edition of the BIOSKOP! Short Film Competition. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611166 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-9-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-9-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-9-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This year’s BIOSKOP! Short Film Competition will be held in Bulawayo and Harare from October 21-23 and 28-30 respectively at venues yet to be announced. Categories will include Best Narrative Short, Best Documentary Short, Best Sound Editing, Best Cinematography and Best Diaspora Film. Winners are set to be awarded cash prizes. The deadline for the free submissions is July 31, 2022. In a statement, EUFF Zimbabwe said the short film competition seeks to cultivate a mentality of accepting change within the  industry. “Change is difficult. Often, we are not ready for it, and most times we don’t want it. But we need it. It is a requirement if we are to move forward if we are to remain progressive.  We strike a balance when we approach things with a sense of awareness and resilience. At this moment, wherever you are, how are you interpreting the times? “As an artiste creative, filmmaker, how are you processing and reshaping your world? Are you staying stagnant or are you moving forward? This competition is open to all genres of film (animation, documentary and live-action). “Films will be judged based on content and creativity, as well as technical aspects, also taking into consideration that some of you might be working with limited resources. Be innovative, work with what you can, and tell us your story,” posted the organisers. – @eMKlass_49
