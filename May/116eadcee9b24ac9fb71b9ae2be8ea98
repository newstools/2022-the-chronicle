The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent MIDLANDS Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Larry Mavima, has implored small-scale miners to regularise their operations saying that will combat illegal extraction activities and enhance improved Government support. Citing the rampant illegal mining operations in the Midlands, the minister said unregulated activities were not adding value to the country’s economy as most of the gold they extract will not find its way to Fidelity Printers and Refiners. <img class="wp-image-612274 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-102.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-102.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-102-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fidelity Printers and Refiners Speaking during a recent tour of Vigilant Resources in Kwekwe, where he was guest of honour, Minister Mavima condemned the invasion by illegal artisanal miners of the Chaka Plant, which is owned by the company. This comes as Vigilant Resources has heightened its operations with a target of producing one tonne of gold by the end of 2023. <img class="alignnone wp-image-591992 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/gold.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/gold.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/gold-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This year, the company is targeting to produce 433kgs gold but has complained over disruption caused by illegal miners. Minister Mavima did not mince his words when he ordered law enforcement agencies and other relevant authorities to do their job without fear or favour to ensure registered businesses were not disrupted by the illegal miners. “I’m told there are some illegal artisanal miners who are now disturbing operations here. Of course, you managed to solve the issue . . . but let me hasten to guarantee you that under my watch, I will not let such a thing happen.  Police and the Ministry of Mines should do their job without fear or favour,” he said. Minister Mavima condemned violent mining disputes and urged illegal miners to get registered and operate within standard regulations that respect the rule of law and property rights. <img class="wp-image-518158 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Some-of-the-illegal-miners.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Some-of-the-illegal-miners.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Some-of-the-illegal-miners-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some of the illegal miners “People should not just dig anywhere they want just because there is gold available. You should follow proper procedure,” he said. “Police should ensure there are no disturbances that happen at companies like this one, which add value to the economy. “People should learn to respect other people’s property, not just to invade everywhere just because there is gold.” The minister said Government would not tolerate lawlessness as it forges ahead with its drive to facilitate improved business operations in line with the mantra “Zimbabwe is Open for Business”. He applauded Vigilant Resources for playing a key role in supporting some artisanal miners as well as embracing environmentally friendly operations. The company is carrying out environmental reclamation activities including tree planting to ensure that all pits are closed after mining activities. Midlands provincial mining director, Mr Tariro Ndlovu, said the adoption of the cadaster system will help bring an end to the problems. “There is rampant illegal mining, which we are trying to extinguish in the province. We urge most miners to come to our offices so that we document them to do mining legally,” he said. “We are making progress as far as the cadaster system is concerned. Once it is up and running, it is going to solve all the mining disputes and illegal operations that we are currently witnessing.” The cadastre system, which will see the Government moving from the manual system to the computerised way of pegging and administration, has been rolled out in Manicaland Province and is expected to be rolled out to the rest of the provinces.
