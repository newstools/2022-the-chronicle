Mbewana said: “After she came out of hospital early in April, Silapha Wellness programme organised a psychologist for her and she told me that she wanted to go with me to those sessions. She wanted to get better so that she can start working. But things got worse last week when she suffered a stroke. I am hurt because she wanted to share her experience as a woman in the music industry with young artists.” She added: “Debra was a talented artiste and we are not going to hear that velvet voice again.

She was concerned that many artistes were struggling and not making any income.”  According to her friends, Fraser, 56, had been critically ill for the past seven days.
