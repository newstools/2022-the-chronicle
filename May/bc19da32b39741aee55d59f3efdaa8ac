RENOWNED writer and History teacher Mr Manners Musongelwa has launched a History book which seeks to demystify regional African History. Mr Musongelwa, a teacher at Camelot Secondary School in Kwekwe teamed up with another teacher Shamiso Sibanda of Mount Pleasant High School in Harare as well as former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Cain Mathema who is now the Minister without Portfolio in the Office of the President and Cabinet to write the book which is titled “A comprehensive base history of regional Africa”. <img class="size-full wp-image-543423" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Cain-Mathema.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Cain-Mathema.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Cain-Mathema-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Cain Mathema The book has since been cleared for use by Advanced Level pupils and tertiary institutions. In an interview after the launch of the book in Harare last week, Mr Musongelwa who is also the History Teachers’ Association of Zimbabwe president said the book seeks to address issues contained in the Continuous Assessment Learning Activities (CALA) that are part of the new curriculum. “We seek to demystify CALA and simplify them. We wrote a whole chapter where we are linking CALA to historical events,” said Mr Musongelwa. He said the book will see more history teachers teaching Paper 2 which almost every teacher shunned due to lack of content.  “Before, there was no content for teachers to use on slave trade, Majimaji, Samory Toure, Mozambique liberation struggle amongst other topics. But the book presents content on all those topics, making it easy for both teachers and students,” he said. Published by Edulight Publishers in Harare, the book has since been rolled out in schools. This is the seventh book Mr Musongelwa has written. Some of his projects include Towards your Destiny, Right Steps, European History, Zimbabwean History, and New Trends Book 3 and 4.
