DEFENDING Arnold Classic men’s physique champion Ryan Gumbo says he will not be taking part in this year’s competition as he is still recovering from a shoulder strain. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608431" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The three-day event will run from June 3-5 in Johannesburg, South Africa. “I am not going for Arnold’s this year. I have decided to focus on other competitions that can guarantee me a pro-card. I am currently in recovery from a left shoulder strain and this forced me not to compete in the first-half of 2022. My first show should be in South Africa in September. We are still awaiting further details on that one. “l will use this as preparation for my journey to the Middle East for the Dubai Muscle Beach show set for October 14-16.  Locally, I’m also looking forward to defending my Mr Zim title at the Zim Nationals set for November 26,” said Gumbo. The Arnold Classic competition was founded in 2016 and is a multi-sport festival that features sports, including bodybuilding, strongman, weightlifting and a wide variety of youth sports, and a large fitness expo. Various sporting codes such as aerial sport, baseball, body painting, deaf sport, Korean martial arts, team chess, arm wrestling, battle heritage, Gauteng aquatics, judo, karate, softball, ringball and speed cubes will be featured in this year’s classic. Arnold Classic Multi Sport and Art Festival Africa says security will be tight at this year’s event after the founder and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger was kicked during his last visit to the country. — @innocentskizoe
