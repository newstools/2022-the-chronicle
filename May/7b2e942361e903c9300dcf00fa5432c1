At the stand we have tour operators, hoteliers, car rentals, airlines and air charter services all under one roof”. During the tour of the ZTA stand, Minister Sisulu said she also wants to adopt the Seven Wonders that Zimbabwe has because they were ideal and reflect more about the natural wonders. Sisulu said that Zimbabwe had the best view of the Victoria Falls and mentioned that if one visited the Falls and did not experience the showers during their tour, “then you hadn’t quite experienced the beauty of the ‘Smoke that Thunders’”. Exhibitors at the stand said they were pleased with the business conducted during day one and expressed optimism that new opportunities had been created.
