THERE is an urgent need for Zimbabwe to embrace sport performance analysis if the country is to compete with the best in the world not only in football but other sport codes as well. This is the view of Tshwane University lecturer and sports analyst, Alliance Kubayi who addressed a public lecture on football coaching and sport science at the National University of Science and Technology on Tuesday. <img class="size-full wp-image-437835" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/National-University-of-Science-and-Technology.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="277" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/National-University-of-Science-and-Technology.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/National-University-of-Science-and-Technology-360x147.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The lecture was attended by various local coaches and performance analysts. Among those who attended were coaches Lizwe Sweswe, Abraham Mubaiwa, Garthly Chipuka and Shadreck Mlauzi. Performance analysis research areas, includes the identification of key performance indicators, injury prevention through work-rate analysis and physical analysis, movement analysis, coaches’ behaviours and feedback processes, effectiveness of technique and tactics, normative profiling, overall match analysis and even the analysis of referees’ performance. It can also help coaches monitor the growth and development of players. At the lecture coaches were urged to come up with scientifically proven training regimes which are ideal for preparing athletes for competition. Kubayi said he had been impressed by the response from the coaches that attended the lecture.  “It was a great opportunity for me to be in Zimbabwe because the coaches who attended were positive in their response to the public lecture. “I am confident that most of those who attended will go on and implement sports performance analysis in their approaches especially in football. “Almost every country is using sport performance analysis. If you want to be the best this is what should be introduced. “We need to invest in that and technology that is the only way we can compete with the best teams in the world. “I was impressed to note that the coaches are eager to be capacitated to learn more about sports analysis and as such, we want this initiative to go to the grassroots level,” said Kubayi. Also in attendance at the lecture was Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede who said: “This is a great initiative. <img class="size-full wp-image-608812" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede Performance analysis is the way to go if we are to improve the game of football. If such a public lecture was done in the presence of all associations and the corporate world, our football would benefit,” said Mutekede. Women’s football coach, Zanele Nzima said:”We have seen it work. Successful players are measured through performance analysis hence we hope to embrace it.” Clemence Matawu, a former footballer who was also in attendance said: “I am a graduate of sports science and still believe we need to move with the times. <img class="size-full wp-image-608820" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clemence Matawu I have seen Chicken Inn and Bulawayo Chiefs embracing sports science and it has worked for them.” — @innocentskizoe
