A MIDLANDS State University (MSU) assistant bursar facing charges of defrauding the university of more than $10 million allegedly vanished at Gweru Magistrate’s Courts before his matter was set-down for trial. Norman Chiwanza now on the police wanted list, had been brought to court to answer allegations of defrauding the university of more than $6 million and US$30 110. <img class="alignnone wp-image-583172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Midlands Provincial Public Prosecutor Mr Samuel Pedzisayi confirmed Chiwanza’s escape. “Norman Chiwanza was supposed to appear in court to answer fraud charges but he escaped before being taken to court. We have since returned the docket to the police who have launched a manhunt for the escapee,” he said.
National Police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the matter. He called on members of the public to assist the police with information that might lead to the arrest of Chiwanza. “Police are investigating the case of Norman Chiwanza who allegedly escaped from police custody in Gweru,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. Sources close to the matter said MSU auditors discovered that Chiwanza, a former auditor with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) had put ghost workers that included his wife, on the university payroll. <img class="alignnone wp-image-433564 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/MSU.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/MSU.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/MSU-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A report was made to the police leading to the arrest of Chiwanza last Wednesday. The sources said Chiwanza was taken to Gweru Central Police Station where he was supposed to be detained overnight waiting to be taken to court the next morning. At the police station, Chiwanza allegedly fell sick and was taken to a local hospital where he was admitted. The sources said Chiwanza was taken to court on Thursday morning. “Chiwanza was taken to court accompanied by one police officer. At court, he was left to sit with other people waiting to be served,” said the source.  It is said that Chiwanza was not in handcuffs and was left unattended by the police officer. “It was only when it was time for him to appear in court, that the police officer and court officials discovered that he had escaped,” said the source. Allegations against Chiwanza are that between January and April this year, he paid ten people including his wife salaries yet they were not employed by the university. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539443 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/salaries.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/salaries.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/salaries-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chiwanza allegedly prejudiced MSU of more than $6 million and USD$30 110. The matter came to light when Chiwanza went on leave.
