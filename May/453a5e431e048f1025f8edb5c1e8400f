WARRIORS’ defender Tendayi Darikwa capped a fine season as captain of Wigan Athletic by leading them back to the English Championship after winning the League One title at the weekend.  Wigan beat Shrewsbury 3-0 to clinch the title with 92 points from 46 games. The Zimbabwean right-back played 43 of the 46 league games for Wigan after joining them from Nottingham Forest.
Darikwa told the media that he was proud to lead Wigan into the English Championship after enduring some tough moments towards the end of the season, as Rotherham United, who finished second with 90 points, put pressure on his side. <img class="wp-image-605476 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-6-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tino Kadewere “To deliver a performance like that is testament to the group. Days like this don’t always come around in this game. Some of the greatest footballers to have ever played the game didn’t win anything in their careers. Every league, every title is tough to win, and to come out on top after 46 games is credit to the lads,” Darikwa said. While Darikwa made his 43rd league appearance, English Premiership side Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba was an unused substitute in their 2-0 home win over Norwich. The Zimbabwean midfielder recently recovered from a four-month injury lay-off and is expected to feature in Villa’s last five games. Villa are currently eight points above the drop zone. <img class="size-full wp-image-605479" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marshal Munetsi The Birmingham-based side is on 40 points from 33 games. In France, the Zimbabwean pair of striker Tino Kadewere and midfielder Marshal Munetsi were not involved in their respective clubs’ games in the topflight league. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605481" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kadewere was an unused substitute as seventh-placed Lyon shocked second-placed Marseille 3-0. Munetsi was sidelined in his 16th placed Reims’ 2-1 away win against Lorrient. Warriors’ defender Teenage Hadebe returned from suspension in the United States America, but could not inspire Houston Dynamo to victory as they lost 2-1 to Austin, who are second on the Western Conference league table. – @ZililoR
