She had a very fruitful event that she organised for mothers to mark Mother’s Day. We were part of the entertainers and had a nice time, away from the usual church. “We brought the church here,” Pastor Charamba said. He said being in Victoria Falls with his family was special. <img class="size-full wp-image-607365" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tilda-Moyo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tilda-Moyo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tilda-Moyo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tilda Moyo “It’s a double joy because we’re celebrating her (Mrs Charamba) as a mother and at the same time, we’re also partnering her to celebrate with other women,” he said. He said the couple had to bring along its daughters to experience the resort city and celebrate the special day as a family. Mai Charamba said it was heartening to celebrate Mother’s Day with family and other women.  “To all mothers out there, you’re loved and appreciated. Some might feel less appreciated, but we want them to know that they have a special place in our hearts hence we’re celebrating together,” she said. – @ncubeleon
