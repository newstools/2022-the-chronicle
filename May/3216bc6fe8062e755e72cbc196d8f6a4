THE Zimbabwe National Art Gallery (NGZ) is set to host its inaugural national Visual Arts Awards this year. The awards that will recognise the amazing work of artists who specialise in painting, photography, architecture, ceramics, design, graphics, digital art and drawing among other areas will be held in July. The gallery invited all Zimbabwean artists who are 18 years old and above to enter their works.  “The Zimbabwe Visual Art Awards will present an expert-based, professionally juried and industrially measurable commendation to practicing artists in Zimbabwe. The awards will centre on encouragement and empowerment of best practices as it will aim to infuse business practices and quasi-commercial aptitude to recipients to urge artists to thrive towards formality in practice,” read a statement issued by the gallery. <img class="size-full wp-image-605488" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ngz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ngz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/ngz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe National Art Gallery NGZ Bulawayo regional director Silenkosi Moyo said: “These are going to be our first awards of this nature and we’re calling all artists around the country to come through with their artwork.
