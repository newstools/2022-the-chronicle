STINGRAYS Swimming Academy is set to honour swimmers who excelled last season at a ceremony slated for Friday. The club enjoyed a successful 2021/22 season by clinching both the Bulawayo Junior and Senior Championships. Stingrays chairperson Nokuthula Cyprianos said they hope the awards will spur her swimmers to achieve more in the coming season. <img class="size-full wp-image-607824" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nokuthula Cyprianos  “The swimmers did well to retain the provincial championships, while others that took on national and international assignments also came with good results. Some of the categories that will be up for grabs include most improved, most valuable, overall junior achiever, most outstanding, most dedicated, most competitive, most consistent, most disciplined and the Memorial Trophy,” she  said.
