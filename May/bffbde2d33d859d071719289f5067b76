At the tournament, we had three Zimbabwe teams in the semi-finals and we ended up competing in the finals as Zimbabwe vs Zimbabwe. It’s really an achievement to us and we promise to continue raising the Zimbabwean flag high,” said Maphosa. Added Maphosa: “We’re looking at retaining our trophy at Dutch Schools as the reigning champions. The team will be debating at World Schools Debating Championship hosted by the Netherlands from 7 to 18 August.”
