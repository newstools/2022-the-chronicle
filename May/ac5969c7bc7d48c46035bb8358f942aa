This rise is likely to continue because we are now in the winter season and the fact that cases are also increasing in South Africa,” he said. “We encourage those who haven’t been vaccinated to get vaccinated. We should continue the other WHO guidelines to prevent Covid-19 transmission.”  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607534" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said transmission will continue and people should be diligent in wearing masks   and practicing social distancing to remain safe. “We are seeing a lot of complacency; people are so relaxed and it’s worrying because soon those who are not vaccinated will suffer the consequences because there is evidence that they are likely to suffer more severe symptoms.” Bulawayo’ divisional environmental health officer (Epidemiology), Nhlonipho Sibanda said the city has also recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases throughout the country for the past few weeks. “Cases have also been detected at two schools in the city since schools opened on May 3 for the second term. Most of these cases are being detected from women while men succumb at a higher rate compared to women. Some of our cases emanated from public events that we recently hosted as a city and we encourage members of the public to get vaccinated to avert deadly effects of the global pandemic, “ said Dr Sibanda. She said Bulawayo was also facing human resources challenges in its continued fight against Covid-19. <img class="wp-image-607242 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Dr-John-Mangwiro.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Dr-John-Mangwiro.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-Dr-John-Mangwiro-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Dr John Mangwiro Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Dr John Mangwiro said vaccination was the only way out as cases are likely to go up countrywide not just in Bulawayo. “Cases are shooting up in neighbouring countries with some even considering lockdowns and we are going to be affected definitely especially if people continue being reluctant as some are shunning vaccination,” he said.  “We all know that our statistics show that Covid-19 is lethal to those who are not vaccinated. Now that our cases are on the rise, we can only safeguard our health by ensuring all those who are eligible are vaccinated. As Government we have availed the vaccines and we are committed to ensuring we achieve herd immunity soon.” — @thamamoe
