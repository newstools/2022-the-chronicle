KING of rhumba/tshibilika music, the ever-energetic Clement Magwaza has started working on a DVD for his latest album titled Sgidihoso. The album, his 12th, was released last year in November and launched in Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. It has been well-received by his fans who argue that Magwaza continues to grow his brand that has been in the game for over two decades. Hits from the album include Ihoso, Salithembisa, Savumelana, Nthembinkosi and Esqhongweni. In an interview, Magwaza said he was elated that bookings for live shows continue to flow adding that he hopes to use them as a way of launching the album’s DVD. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-334136" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/microphone-with-audience.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/microphone-with-audience.jpg 640w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/microphone-with-audience-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> He also expressed his wish of taking his work to international markets through the forthcoming DVD. “The reopening of the arts sector has come with it, benefits for us as a band and I want to use that opportunity to launch Sgidihoso DVD. I hope to do so by September 30 as we’ll launch it here in Zimbabwe then Botswana and South Africa.  “It’s my wish that after having been in the game for a while, I take my work to international stages. I’m in talks with certain people with the plan to take the DVD launch to the United Kingdom,” said Magwaza. Magwaza’s international dream is one that he hopes will suffice as a lot of his fans who hail from the Matabeleland region’s rural areas are based in the Diaspora. They have been supportive of his art through financing his studio recordings and purchasing recording and sound equipment. – @mthabisi_mthire
