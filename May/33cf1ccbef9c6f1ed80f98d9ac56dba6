I felt emotionally, physically and spiritually ready to bind my life with Precious. We’ve been together since we were children and it made perfect sense to upgrade our love. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606684" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-23-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I spent a lot of time travelling around the globe and irrespective of my absence, she said she would wait for me. I’m over the moon that we’re now husband and wife after being together for a very long time,” said Hwabaraty. Quizzed on how he felt about tying the knot with someone who is not from an artistic background, Hwabaraty laughed and said it works “perfectly fine”. “My wife is like a recluse and loves her personal space. She is your typical stay-at-home wife and is ignorant of what I do, but our union works perfectly fine.” <img class="size-full wp-image-440193" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/khaya.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/khaya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/khaya-360x212.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khaya Arts A cultural ambassador in his own right, Hwabaraty has been involved in the film industry where he played the role of a traditional healer in Zimbabwean sitcom Izolo Yizolo.
