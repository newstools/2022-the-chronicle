GOVERNMENT is forging ahead with opening of the airwaves to achieve digital rights through safeguarding citizens and content creators’ rights to free expression and access to information. Zimbabwe has been in the process of aligning its laws to the 2013 Constitution resulting in the unbundling in 2019 of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) through the gazetting of the Freedom of Information Bill and the Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC) Bill. In addition, the Cybercrime and Cybersecurity Bill was merged with the Data Protection Bill to produce the Cybercrime, Cybersecurity and Data Protection Bill, 2019 . The Minister of Information Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Monica Mutsvangwa, said this while addressing delegates attending the writeshop on the alignment of legislation to the Constitution in particular the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 2021 at the Village Lodge in Gweru yesterday. <img class="size-full wp-image-596432" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Monica-Mutsvangwa-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Monica-Mutsvangwa-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Minister-Monica-Mutsvangwa-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa The writeshop, she said, bears testimony to the efforts being made by Government in realigning the legal and regulatory framework to the provisions of the Constitution. She said the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa believes in engagement and unity of purpose. “This is why as Government we made the decision to have these consultative processes as we realign our laws to the Constitution. It is my hope that we will all work together during this process and come up with a law that speaks to the needs of the Zimbabwe media sector and its practitioners as well as our vision as a Nation ensuring that we leave no one and no place behind as we march towards Vision 2030,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. She said there have been improvements in the media sector recently. “The Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) was repealed and in its place was enacted, the Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 10:33) and the Zimbabwe Media Commission Act (Chapter 10:35), in an effort to realise freedom of expression. We are also working on the Media Practitioners Bill which will focus on co-regulation in the sector,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. So far, she said Government has licensed 14 community radio stations and six national free to air television stations. “Seven campus radio stations have also been licensed to improve campus communication as well as provide media students with practical broadcasting skills such that they are ready for the market at the time they complete their studies. All this was achieved in a space of three years. The media landscape in Zimbabwe has surely been transformed for better with both plurality of channels and a diversity of players,” she said.  “The Government is forging ahead with opening of the airwaves to achieve digital rights through safeguarding citizens and content creators’ rights to free expression and access to information.” Minister Mutsvangwa said the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill principally seeks to align the Broadcasting Services Act Chapter (12:06) with the Constitution and also with the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act (Chapter 10:31) as well as modernise it in line with technological advancements. “The Act was last amended in 2007. Certain sections of the Act have become inconsistent with the new Constitution, something which has necessitated the current alignment process. Technology has also evolved rapidly over the last few years pointing to the need for the broadcasting laws to be modernised. “From this write shop it is my expectation that we come up with a law that ensures diversity in the broadcasting sector, enables capacitation and sustainability of community radio stations and facilitates participation of the diaspora in the broadcasting industry, among other milestones,” she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-610119" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Minister--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa “It is my hope that after our deliberations and agreed on proposals, the legislative process will be expedited at the Attorney General’s office.” Minister Mutsvangwa said Government does not want a repeat of the 2019 scenario where stakeholders gathered in Nyanga for a writeshop similar to the Gweru one but the proposed changes were overtaken by events and not actioned. “I therefore appeal for prompt action to be taken in ensuring that this Bill becomes law. As we deliberate let us bear in mind that the last Broadcast Service Amendment Bill was presented to the Cabinet Committee on Legislation which took certain positions on different clauses, you will be advised on what those clauses are and what position was taken,” she said. The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill seeks to address lack of diversity and plurality in the sector. The Bill seeks to further open up the airwaves by licensing community and campus radio stations and privately owned TV stations.
