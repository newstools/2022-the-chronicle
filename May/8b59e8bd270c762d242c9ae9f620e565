Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, sponsors  of one of Africa’s popular marathons, said this year’s event will be held physically in the resort town. “We are delighted to announce that registration is now open for this year’s Econet Victoria Falls Marathon and to let the public know that this year’s event will be back to full capacity,” said Econet spokesperson Fungai Mandiveyi. “We look forward to welcoming back familiar and new athletes to this year’s event, which will be run under the theme ‘Run the Big Three.” Veteran athletes will battle it out along the ‘Elephant Route’, the full 42.2km marathon, while the ‘Leopard Route’ will be for the 21.1km half marathon. The 7.5km ‘Lion Route’ is the popular fun run, which often attracts families, along with some first-time runners.  “We are excited that once again there will be something for everyone at this year’s marathon; for serious and veteran athletes as well as for family and friends out to have some fun and a healthy good time at the seventh wonder of the world,” said Mandiveyi. For local athletes, the 7.5km fun run attracts a fee of US$5, the half marathon (US$10) and full marathon (US$15). Athletes from the SADC region will pay US$5 for the 7.5km route, US$30 for the half marathon and US$40 for the full marathon. Other international participants from outside the SADC region will pay registration fees of US$10, US$50 and US$60 for the three respective races. On race day, it is now the tradition to have Zumba dance classes and a variety of fun and entertainment for the entire family. – @innocentskizoe
