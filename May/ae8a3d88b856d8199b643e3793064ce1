Antonio’s 68th minute horror tackle from behind earned the schoolboy a straight red card, while Tandi was rushed to hospital after receiving treatment for 13 minutes on the pitch. <img class="size-full wp-image-609121" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-defender-Andrew-Tandi-being-taken-off-the-pitch-after-suffering-a-horrific-injury.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-defender-Andrew-Tandi-being-taken-off-the-pitch-after-suffering-a-horrific-injury.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-defender-Andrew-Tandi-being-taken-off-the-pitch-after-suffering-a-horrific-injury-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders defender Andrew Tandi being taken off the pitch after suffering a horrific injury Antonio tweeted: “I’m sorry for what happened yesterday, it wasn’t intentional.
