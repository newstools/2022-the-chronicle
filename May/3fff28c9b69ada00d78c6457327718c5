ZIMBABWE National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board (ZNBWCB) secretary-general Lawrence Zimbudzana says the forthcoming two international boxing events will increase continental and global visibility of the country. Zimbabwe will host the World Boxing Council (WBC) All-Africa Officials Training Workshop and Africa Boxing Union (ABU) Convention in the prime resort city of Victoria Falls from July 25-27 and July 29-30 respectively. The project is being supported by the Government after the country was confirmed as host at the 59th convention of the World Boxing Council held in Mexico City in November 2021. The ABU has 56 member countries and is affiliated to the World Boxing Council (WBC).  The two events will attract delegates from across the African continent and an average of 100 delegates are be expected to attend each of the two events. ABU president and WBC vice-president Houcine Houchi will preside over the proceedings. The workshop will target boxing technical officials from African countries and affiliates from other WBC regions. The ABU convention will target general assembly members and leaders of boxing commissions from the 54 member countries in Africa. Zimbudzana says the events will be hugely beneficial to the country. “The key objectives for hosting the workshop and convention include upskilling of boxing technical officials on the African continent at the same time providing a networking platform for stakeholders. Furthermore, delegates will have an opportunity to share best practices and new trends in the boxing industry. “The hosting of both events is in sync with the National Development Strategy (NDS) 1 goal of ‘Increased participation and improved performance’ through hosting of major events.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-468469 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/boxing-gwanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/boxing-gwanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/boxing-gwanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “It presents the country with a unique opportunity to market and position Zimbabwe as a serious player in the boxing world for sport tourism,” said Zimbudzana. “Hosting of the workshop and convention further resonates well with the engagement and re-engagement thrust of the Second Republic as well as sport diplomacy. It is our considered view that in order to improve the quality of boxing in the country, region and continent, there is a need for considerable investment in capacity development. The hosting of this workshop is thus an initiative aligned to the ZNBCWB vision to have ‘An Excelling and Inclusive Combat Sport Nation by 2030,’” he said. – @innocentskizoe
