GOVERNMENT has warned road authorities and contractors that no payment will be processed for any shoddy and substandard work. In an interview on Wednesday, DDF acting director and a member of the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Program (ERRP) technical team Engineer Goodwill Mapako, said they learnt cruel lessons last year after discovering that some contractors had been paid handsomely yet the quality of work did not justify the amount paid.  “We have heard of shoddy works by road authorities which is worrying but we have since taken a position that regardless of whether the work is done in-house by the responsible authority or it’s outsourcing, that job must be of high quality. If we find some shoddy work, they are not going to be paid. Payment will only be processed after complying with the specifics of the work given,” said Eng Mapako who is part of the entourage led by the Permanent Secretary for DDF in the Office of the President and Cabinet Mr Christopher Shumba that is visiting various road authorities in Bulawayo and Matabeleland North provinces. <img class="size-full wp-image-606709" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mr-Christopher-Shumba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mr-Christopher-Shumba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Mr-Christopher-Shumba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Christopher Shumba “We are checking the progress of the road construction that they have covered, also making sure they not only utilise the funds but do so by having quality work,” said Eng Mapako. The Bulawayo City Council has already come under fire for failing to fully utilise more than $625 million allocated by treasury under the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme 2 which has resulted in delays in the implementation of road projects in the city. Government released $217 million with the rest of the funds expected to be disbursed after initial acquittals had been made but BCC only used $21 million of that amount. <img class="size-full wp-image-584358" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/ruzwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/ruzwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/ruzwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Clever Ruswa The delegation, that also included the Procurement Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) chief executive officer Mr Clever Ruswa, visited the site of the Bulawayo-Tsholotsho Road construction under Umguza district where they were told by Matabeleland North Acting provincial road engineer Engineer Tatenda Nyikayaramba that work was progressing smoothly and was on course to cover the 5KM stretch in six months. “Initially the width of this road was 4 metres but we are widening it to 8 metres,” said Eng Nyikayaramba.
