The late Ms Ndlovu’s family house is not very far from where her body was discovered. Neighbours and witnesses said the late Ms Ndlovu used to visit her boyfriend Ncube each time he was around. A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said on Monday last week, children noticed a pied crow (iwabayi) perched on top of the roof, just above the room where the body was discovered. The source said the previous week, police officers had visited the house asking the whereabouts of the late Ms Ndlovu.  “The police arrived here and they said they were looking for Mhlonipheni Ncube. I told them that I knew him as he used to come at night and briefly stay at the house,” said the source. “When children told us that they saw iwabayi perched on the roof of the house, I then phoned Mhlonipheni and asked if he had left some meat in the room and he said he did and he would come and get it over the weekend.” Police are appealing to those with information that may lead to the arrest of the accused to contact any nearest police station. — Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
