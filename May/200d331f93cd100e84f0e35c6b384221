PLATINUM producer, Mimosa Mining Company has donated an incubator worth more than US$18 000 to Zvishavane District Hospital. The latest assistance is one of the support packages the company has continuously given to the hospital to help promote healthcare delivery.  Zvishavane District Hospital serves a wide geographical area, a total of 24 health centres, and therefore needs enormous support for improved service delivery. In 2020, the Zvishavane-based platinum miner sunk close to US$2 million in constructing, refurbishing, and fully equipping the state-of-the-art private ward that is providing quality specialist healthcare services only previously available in big cities. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605607" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The private ward was officially commissioned by President Mnangagwa who hailed the smart partnership between the company and the hospital. Mimosa Mining Company general manager, Mr Stephen Ndiyamba handed over the incubator during a function that was held at the hospital. Mr Ndiyamba expressed hope that the incubator will help prevent and reduce infant deaths that occur due to inadequate incubators in the hospital. An incubator is designed to provide a safe, controlled space for infants to live while their vital organs develop. “The health and well-being of the people in Zvishavane and Mberengwa catchment area has been the priority of Mimosa Mining Company as the company is committed to making a positive impact in the communities through the provision of quality health care. We are optimistic that the incubators would help save many lives and significantly reduce neonatal deaths in this area,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605781" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Zvishavane-District-Hospital.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Zvishavane-District-Hospital.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Zvishavane-District-Hospital-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zvishavane District Development Co-ordinator Mr Darlington Chokera who received the incubator on behalf of the Government said he was hopeful it would go a long way to improve healthcare delivery and reduce infant mortality associated with premature births. He said the handover of incubators highlights the importance of public-private partnerships aimed at improving the quality of life and standards of living. “This is in line with the vision 2030 as enunciated by President Mnangagwa. Special mention to Mimosa Mining Company for their unwavering commitment to the corporate social responsibility in surrounding communities and beyond,” said Mr Chokera. <img class="size-full wp-image-605100" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Mimosa has over the years been assisting patients and healthcare workers through the construction of a modern mortuary, a laundry facility, and the refurbishment of staff houses.
