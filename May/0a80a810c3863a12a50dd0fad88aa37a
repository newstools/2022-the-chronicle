QUEEN Elizabeth Children’s Home on Sunday received a major boost when gospel musician Everton Mlalazi, through his music brand EM Music in collaboration with various sponsors, donated a brand new truck to the Bulawayo based orphanage. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611556 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The musician who hosted a successful gospel music concert on Saturday at the ZITF, topped up the donation with a brand new washing machine and groceries. Mlalazi said he was moved to donate to the institution as it is taking care of children without parents. “I grew up with both parents but these children that are here do not have parents and have been adopted into this home and some people are giving up their time to care for them. Even though I grew up with parents, things were not rosy but our parents were soldiers and made sure we were well cared for. But these children rely on the people taking care of them here to be those soldiers I had in my parents. I brought my two daughters here so that they learn that it is a privilege to have both parents in their lives,” said Mlalazi. Mlalazi said the donation was a result of a collaboration with companies, which also assisted him host the Home Coming Gospel Show. He said they will continue to assist the institution in the coming years and will visit it every time they hold the Home Coming Show which will be an annual event. “Agri Foods, Trek, Fossil Group, Grain Hub, Yakha Bricks and RHI Media have donated a Hino four tone truck, they got you a 17kg Defy washing machine so that you wash children’s clothes and various groceries. We also have been told that the Bulawayo City Council wants to close your water due to debts that you have but worry not, we will cover that. <img class="wp-image-589407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bulawayo-City-Council-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council “My friend’s Platinum brands also have brought you mealie meal while Papyrus books are giving you exercise books, pens and Steers brought the children some lunch. I also heard that you are struggling to send some children to school. I assure you that we will send them to school not for a term but until they are done,” said Mlalazi as he handed over the donations to elated members of staff at the orphanage. Arundel Group of Hospitals chipped in by providing free medical examination and medication to the children.
Mlalazi, who was accompanied by his band members, friends and business partners, spent time singing and playing with the children. The orphanage director Mrs Ellen Mupfumi burst into tears when Mlalazi announced the donation. Mrs Mupfumi said the truck will help in moving produce from the orphanage’s farm in West Acre near Figtree. “We were badly in need of the truck and we have been talking about it but never did it cross my mind that God would answer our prayer so soon. “We thank you so much for your generosity. You could have given it to your relatives and no one would have faulted you but you chose our institution and for that we are eternally grateful,” she said.  Seventh Day Adventist Church Zimbabwe West Union Conference president who is also the chairperson of the board running the orphanage, Pastor Micah Choga, hailed Mlalazi for the donation and urged members of the community to live a life of service to others.
