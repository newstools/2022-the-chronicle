Backing vocals were provided by Kim Makumbe. “Yini Indaba is a song that derives its meaning from Romans 7 verse 19 which says ‘For I do not do the good that I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. ’ In this song, I’m basically rebuking my soul and asking myself so many questions as to why I keep on going back to the bad ways. “So the video shows me living two lives. The first life is of purity, but I then get lured by a group of fun-loving friends who keep inviting me to parties, nightclubs, and bar activities. My conscience will still tell me that the life I am living is not the right one for me. After deep introspection, I’m then able to get a local Bible study group and get accepted there. <img class="wp-image-570964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible I also get the necessary counselling and in the end, I’m able to ignore the temptations and make a conscious decision to live a clean life,” she said in an interview. The Lujulile hit-maker who hails from Bulawayo said the track advocates for purity and discourages giving in to temptations. “Yini Indaba is therefore a song that advocates for purity. We’ll always have temptations in this world, but we then need to have the strength and attitude to overcome them.” The gospel artiste, who has worked with the likes of Shingisai Suluma, Mathias Mhere, Taz, the late Sam Mtukudzi and Alexio Kawara, expressed optimism over the reception of the single. “The song is doing well and has already reached 60 000 views in four days. This shows that it’s really receiving a great reception. I’m known as the Queen of collaborations but this time around I chose to take a break from them and focused on bringing out the undiluted Rose Mambo to the world,” Rose said. She said working with DJ Tamuka on the song paved a great path for it. “DJ Tamuka worked his magic to help bring the best out of the song. It was also my first time working with director Zorodzai Chibuwe on the video and I feel the video is exceptional,” she said.  Rose’s career began in 2003 when she released her debut album, Kufamba NaJesu. In 2007, she released an album titled Mazuva. On the same album, she featured Sam Mtukudzi on the title track as well as Patience Musa on the song, Ndinokudai. Lujulile, a track that she released in 2020, and was produced by DJ Tamuka, was her breakthrough song. It was played on most radio stations where it was on rotation. – @SeehYvonne
