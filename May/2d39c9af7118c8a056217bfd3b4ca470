GOVERNMENT is introducing a smart traffic management system in all cities across the country with cameras set to be installed on all controlled intersections and strategic points to gather information and monitor traffic flow as part of the smart city project. The system will create a platform for the real-time electronic monitoring of roads, receipting, reconciliation of fines, docket management, and analysis of traffic information and statistics across the whole country.  The project is also expected to reduce road carnage attributable to human error, while improving operational efficiencies in the administration of local authorities and law enforcement agencies. Crime detection and enforcement will be enhanced, while revenue collection will also be increased through optimised systems.
The smart traffic management system will be integrated with relevant electronic platforms at the Central Vehicle Registry, Zimbabwe National Roads Administration, Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Interpol and other relevant ministries, Government departments and agencies. A smart city uses information and communication technology (ICT) to improve operational efficiency, share information with the public and provide a better quality of Government services and citizen welfare. The main goal of a smart city is to optimise city functions and promote economic growth, while also improving the quality of life for citizens by using smart technologies and data analysis in line with Vision 2030. In her post-Cabinet briefing yesterday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the smart city solutions proposal, which was adopted by Cabinet, relates to the strategic area which will introduce operational efficiencies in law enforcement and city administration through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs). <img class="size-full wp-image-608151" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa “The Minister of Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services, Dr Jenfan Muswere, presented a proposal on the Smart City Project, which was adopted by Cabinet. The smart city solutions proposal relates to the strategic area which will introduce operational efficiencies in law enforcement and city administration through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs),” she said. Minister Mutsvangwa said the implementation of the solutions is spearheaded by the Ministry of Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services. “The current proposal relates to the smart traffic management system that is monitoring and surveillance with cameras and integration of systems under the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development. The integration of systems under the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development will link a number of operational systems as well as those to be installed in the ministry,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. A committee was set up to work on the linkage of all the systems to the National Data Centre. The targeted systems are in the CVR, Zinara, Zimpost, Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) and other relevant Departments in the road and vehicle management area. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-459945" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Cabinet advises that the Ministry of Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services will directly engage Ministries, Departments and Agencies and Technical Partners for the deployment of the Smart City Solutions across the country,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. Under this arrangement, the selected partners will fund the procurement of equipment and implementation of smart solutions on a revenue-share basis, with investment recouped from revenues generated by the respective project on a Build Operate Transfer basis as part of expediting the implementation of the projects. “The smart city project has many benefits. It will ensure that all criminals who skip red traffic lights and commit similar crimes are easily traced and brought to book. The project is also expected to reduce road carnage attributable to human error, while improving operational efficiencies in the administration of local authorities and law enforcement agencies,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “Crime detection and enforcement will be enhanced, while revenue collection will also be increased through optimised systems.” – @mashnets.
