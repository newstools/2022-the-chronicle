AT a time Highlanders’ fans are frustrated by lack of results, Bosso players have pleaded with their followers to rally behind them in the blockbuster clash with Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. The players made the impassioned plea at yesterday’s media briefing and promised to battle for victory and restore the club’s battered pride.  Striker Lynoth Chikuhwa, who has fired blanks in five games, called on Highlanders’ supporters not to turn against them when the going gets tough. Andrew Mbeba said they demonstrated in the past month that with supporters’ backing they are able to escape from the jaws of defeat and settle for a share of points. <img class="wp-image-608419 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andrew Mbeba In the last month Bosso twice came from 2-0 down to force 2-2 draws against Cranborne Bullets and Bulawayo Chiefs at Barbourfields Stadium. They also shared the spoils with Chicken Inn 1-1 in a match the Gamecocks dominated and coach Joey Antipas gave Bosso followers credit for helping lift their side. – @ZililoR
