THE Lady Chevrons are back in business and have started preparations for the ICC Women’s T20 Cricket World Cup Qualifier set for September. <img class="alignnone wp-image-483286 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/cricket-ball.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/cricket-ball.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/cricket-ball-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The venue for the competition is yet to be announced, but the Zimbabwe women’s team is already in camp preparing for the event. This will be the fifth edition of the Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier and will serve as a qualification tournament for the 2023 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup tournament. Participating teams will include Ireland, Bangladesh, Thailand, Scotland, Papua New Guinea, USA and UAE. The top two teams from the tournament will progress to the 2023 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup finals in South Africa. A 19-member squad is in camp minus South Africa-based Sharne Mayers and Anesu Mushangwe, who is based in Australia. Lady Chevrons skipper Mary-Anne Musonda joined the camp last week from the recent FairBreak Global tournament held in Dubai. The Lady Chevrons have been training with the Under-19 side that will take part in the ICC Under-19 Women’s World Cup in January next year. The 2023 ICC Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup will be the first edition of the ICC Women’s Under-19 Cricket World Cup in South  Africa. In April 2021, the ICC announced that the tournament had been moved from its original slot at the end of  2021 to January 2023 because of Covid-19.
