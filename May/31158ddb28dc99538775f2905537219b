The Chronicle “So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.”
Romans 14 vs 12 One of the hardest things to accept is that you are wrong. It’s so much easier to always play the victim and blame everything that happens around you on someone else, on your circumstances, on the unfairness of life, your background, or even on the devil. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605191" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Introspection is one of the most difficult things to do, to honestly look at yourself and say, “ok, that was probably my fault.” So many people go through life allowing pride to control them and stubbornly refusing to acknowledge their weaknesses. Sometimes you don’t need to change your circle or cut people off, it’s you who needs to change. It takes you admitting your faults and taking responsibility. For as long as you pretend everything else is wrong but you, you will remain stuck in a never ending cycle of bad relationships, bad breaks, isolation and a life devoid of peace and joy.  Take a step back and be honest about your part and contribution in whatever is happening. Don’t play victim to circumstances you created, take ownership, release it and let God heal you. God cannot heal you from what you keep hidden or pretend doesn’t exist. We all have character flaws, no one is perfect, but improvement begins the day you accept them and make a decision to change, thereby allowing yourself to receive God’s forgiveness and become spiritually mature. Be blessed
