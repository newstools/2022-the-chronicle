NBS, which is airing every Saturday at 7pm on ZBCtv, has resident judges in the form of socialite Passion Java, songstress Gemma Griffiths and producer DJ Tamuka with a guest judge joining the team on different episodes.

NBS director Ted Courage Lazaro of Ngoda TV said: “We have done a first-round where we auditioned people in six cities and towns, namely Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo, Chitungwiza, Harare and Mutare. One hundred and twenty-eight people qualified for the second round and in the second round, we are going to have 20 finalists. That’s where we will start eliminating from. “For the programming of the show, every city has an episode,” said Lazaro. <img class="size-full wp-image-578979" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/pj1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/pj1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/pj1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Passion Java Passion Java, speaking through his spokesperson Boss Lashan said: “NBS is the next biggest TV production to come out of Zimbabwe. It’s a music reality competition show which seeks to get the person with the potential to become the next big superstar to the calibre of superstars we have witnessed like Winky D, Jah Prayzah and Oliver Mtukudzi. “The idea behind NBS is to create a platform and opportunity for the person who is going to be that next big artiste to come out of Zimbabwe through giving them the resources, attention, mentorship and time to become big by getting the best out of their abilities,” said Boss Lashan.  He said there will be guest appearances on the show from industry players who are doing great. “We’ll have Mr Brown who is working with the top artistes in SA like Makhadzi and Master KG on the show. We’ll also have radio DJs and mentors who’ll be coming on board like Roki and Isaac Chirwa.” Boss Lashan said they are finalising with Gateway Stream to have the show availed on that service so that those outside Zimbabwe can watch it. “We’re also in talks with DStv to partner with us,” he added. – @mthabisi_mthire
