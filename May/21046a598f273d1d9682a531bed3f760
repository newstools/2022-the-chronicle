Tomorrow, a new gin brand is set to be unveiled. After shutting down the Amapiano Festival last month, local event organiser Vuyisile Ndlovu has partnered with local distiller Comrades Beverages to open another avenue for entertainment lovers with the launch of the Bulawayoman Gin. The Bulawayoman Gin joins the already available Bantu Royal Gin and Zambezi Gin from Matabeleland.  Ndlovu said the idea to have his own branded liquor brand emanated from a joke he shared last year while on a tour at Matopos. “The idea came sometime in early 2021 when I partnered with a local distiller Comrades Beverages. These guys wanted to do some events to market their products, which include the Matobo Gin and iRum YeSintu, and at that time, I was into event planning and promoting. “So, one afternoon after we hosted a comedy show at Tshabalala Game Sanctuary in Matopos, I joked about how it would be nice to have my own alcohol brand and subconsciously, the idea grew in my head,” said Ndlovu. After shelving it and focusing on other pressing projects, such as the AmaPiano Festival and the soon-coming Let’s Chow Foodie Conference, Ndlovu, realising the success of his other brands, decided to act upon his genius Gin idea. <img class="wp-image-610684 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-46-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-46-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-46-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tshabalala Game Sanctuary “With the success of my other brands, the idea of a branded liquor started to make more business sense and Comrades Beverages graciously agreed to partner with me on this project, albeit a year later after having started off as a passing joke,” he said. Unlike other brands in the liquor industry, The Bulawayoman Gin is, exclusive and will never make it to the retail market. <img class="wp-image-608754 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bantu-Royal-Gin.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bantu-Royal-Gin.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bantu-Royal-Gin-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bantu Royal Gin Rather, according to Ndlovu, it will be sold exclusively to individuals. “The Bulawayoman Gin won’t be sold in shops and bars. It’ll be sold strictly by inviting individuals in and around Bulawayo in various circles who have been identified without fear or favour as patriots of the City of Kings and are united by their evident love of Bulawayo, regardless of their social standing, political affiliation, and sexual orientation. “Furthermore, only 1 000 bottles will be produced and released in batches of 50 per month. After that, production will cease completely,” he added. Generally, when a new product is launched, people gather and even taste it, but that will not be the case with the Bulawayoman Gin as it will be launched virtually on Instagram tomorrow. With the tagline, “Abunathwe”, Ndlovu said the triple distilled and handcrafted Gin will purely resonate with the dominant Ndebele tribe. “I’m from Bulawayo and the dominant tribe is Ndebeles so we decided to rope them in and celebrate our local products with them. We believe locals will enjoy the gin,” said Ndlovu.
