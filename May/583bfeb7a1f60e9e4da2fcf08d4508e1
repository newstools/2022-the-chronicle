Zimbabwe National Karate Federation (ZNKF) participated in the event, which was attended by the vice-president of the World Karate Federation (WKF) Bechir Cherif, WKF executive member Souleymane Gaye, and WKF expert coach Professor Antonio Oliva Seba. <img class="size-full wp-image-613300" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bechir-Cherif-wkf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bechir-Cherif-wkf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Bechir-Cherif-wkf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> World Karate Federation (WKF) Bechir Cherif Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe participated in the championships.

ZNKF was formed as a breakaway from the Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU), which was expelled from the WKF in March last year for failing to amend its constitution and align it with the global governing board’s rules and regulations.  Amended WKF statutes prohibit affiliates from mixing semi-contact and full-contact karate, which ZKU continued to administer. The WKF affiliates must only practice semi-contact karate. — @innocentskizoe
