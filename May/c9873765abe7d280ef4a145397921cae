PLAYERS in the goat breeding sector have been encouraged to build a critical mass of stock before venturing into the export market in order to sustain a steady supply chain. Globally, demand for goat meat is on the rise and local farmers have been urged to scale up production and target exports to increase earnings and revive the country’s economy. Bulawayo Global Consortium, a diversified limited company that offers unique and attractive investment opportunities, has scheduled a one-day goat conference on Wednesday under the theme: “Understanding the goat value chain”.  The conference seeks, to among other issues, explore the goat value chain as well as to bring under one roof players in this value chain. It also seeks to establish partnerships among breeders and stakeholders. Bulawayo Global Consortium director, Mrs Sifiso Agbetorwoka, told the Business Chronicle that it was important for breeders targeting export markets to first build enough stock before venturing out. “At the moment it’s difficult to export as a country because we do not have enough goats. If we were to export now, in less than a week we would have run out of stock,” she said. “We need a critical mass to sustain exports. More breeders are needed and those already breeding should upscale before we start exporting. “Right now we don’t have the numbers. We need to build up first and improve quality,” she said. To be competitive in the export market, Mrs Agbetorwoka said, it was pertinent for breeders to be equipped with value addition skills, creating a sustainable goat economy and the commercial side of goat breeding. “So, we will gather experts in the industry from the nutrition side, understanding goat health in commercial settings and having someone who is already breeding to share experiences,” she said. “We need to address value addition because at the moment, we seem to be focusing on breeding and ignoring other critical components of the value chain. <img class="wp-image-610995 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Leather “Processing of meat is also important. One can hardly find a goat burger or sausages. That has to be addressed.” She said during this week’s meeting, players in the leather sector have been invited to give a talk on caring for the skins as they have a commercial value. “Also there is a lot of wastage of skins, that’s another part of the value chain we need to interrogate. Breeders need to know how to take care of the skins as that is another additional financial stream,” she said. “The leather industry is still in existence and in conversations with players in that sector, they have indicated that they need goat skins for leather jackets, handbags and other products.” The conference also seeks to inspire and encourage goat farmers and breeders to produce more. “In the Arab world, a white female goat is of high value so this is a ready market that they have already,” said Mrs Agbetorwoka. — @nqobilebhebhe
