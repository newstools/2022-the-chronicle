The council also engaged a consultant to come up with designs for roadworks and sewer reticulation system. The designs have since been submitted to the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities and once approved works will commence. The Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle houses were constructed in 2013 but the area has not been serviced forcing residents to live without water, sewer reticulation, electricity and roads. The residents decided to take matters into their own hands and mobilised resources to develop their area. Some of the residents have installed a sewer system and connected water in some of the houses. <img class="alignnone wp-image-608628 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The municipality will reimburse residents who have used their money. Those who still do not have water are buying water from their neighbours. The Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle housing scheme in Gwanda has 530 houses. A resident, Mrs Melody Masiya, said it came as a huge relief that their area was finally going to be developed. “It’s pleasing that finally, Government is doing something to develop our place. I have been living here for three years and it’s been tough staying here without toilets, water and electricity. “I have seen workers that are digging pits where they are going to install tower lights which means that the development programme is on course,” she said. Mrs Masiya said the tower lights will help to reduce criminal activities as criminals were taking advantage of the absence of lights to commit offences such as robberies. Another resident Mr Caleb Mathe said they had long awaited for their area to be developed. He said he had stayed at Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle for the past nine years where he has had to live without water and ablution facilities. Mr Mathe said it was their desire to see the project completed timeously. “As residents, our living conditions left us thinking that we have been sidelined from development initiatives but we are relieved that soon more development will be coming to our area in addition to the work that we have already done. “Government promised to develop our area and we are relieved that this promise is being fulfilled. We hope that the programme will be completed hastily and not drag for too long,” he said. Mr Mathe said public transporters were neglecting their area because of the poor road network and once roads are constructed it would bring huge relief to residents. He said some residents who own vehicles had to leave them at car parks as they could not access their homes. The councillor of Ward 8, Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle said the contractor who was responsible for putting up tower lights was already on the ground. He said the council had identified contractors for all the tenders. Clr Ndebele said the municipality was determined to ensure that the project was completed quickly. “We are relieved that the development that the people of Garikai area have been waiting for is finally here. We will do all in our power as council to ensure the project is completed at a fast pace but that will be determined by the release of funds and payment of the contractor by Government,”  Gwanda municipality environment management works committee chairperson, councillor Thulani Moyo said it was their desire to ensure that the remaining contractors start work as soon as possible. He said the municipality was continuously engaging the Ministry of National Housing to ensure that all documentation and payments were done timeously. Clr Moyo said four tower lights will be put up in the area. @DubeMatutu
