He also provided food and shelter to comrades in the struggle and was known as a smart, dedicated and reliable ally,” read part of the DCC letter to the province. Cde Chikomba according to his biography, is also famed for challenging the party’s structure over the dismisal of the then Vice President of Zimbabwe Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa by filling an urgent chamber application with the High Court when he was illegally dismissed from the party in 2017. <img class="wp-image-601446 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Emmerson Mnangagwa He first became a member of parliament for Gokwe North in 2005 before being elected into the central committee in 2008. From humble beginnings, having grown up in a village, he became a bus driver and taking advantage of the the revolutionary party’s progressive black empowerment policies, Cde Chikomba managed to build his own empire with interests in agriculture, transport, retail and real estate.  He leaves behind a vast retail business at Chitekete Business Centre.. “Bhudhi was down to earth, approachable and will be sorely missed. He was an asset to the district and the entire province. His contributions to the province and the nation will never be forgotten. “We hope the province will accede to the request of Gokwe North District and honour the late Cde with a well deserving status,” further read the letter from the Gokwe North DCC.
