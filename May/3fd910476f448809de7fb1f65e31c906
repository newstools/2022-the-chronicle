GOVERNMENT has been challenged to set up drug rehabilitation centres in all the country’s provinces. During a Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church drug abuse awareness campaign held in Entumbane suburb on Sunday, Active Youth Zimbabwe executive director, Mr Romeo Matshazi said imbanje is one of the most abused drugs in the country due to easy access to it and lower cost compared to hard drugs like cocaine and heroin. <img class="size-full wp-image-609442" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/imbanje.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/imbanje.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/imbanje-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Imbanje SDA church members marched in the suburb carrying banners with information educating residents on the drug problem. “Drug abuse is a major issue affecting the whole country and you find that drug addicts are being taken to mental health hospitals which are not proper for drug rehabilitation and treatment services because we do not have rehabilitation centres. I therefore, call upon the Government to avail funds for drug programming so that we are able to meet the needs arising out of the scourge. This is a national problem which organisations like us cannot fight alone,” said Mr Matshazi. “We managed to get land in Pumula suburb to set up a drug rehabilitation centre but due to financial constraints we are failing to move forward in setting up the centre. Drug rehabilitation centres are needed throughout the country as the problem is national.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-609445" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Concern-over-drug-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Concern-over-drug-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Concern-over-drug--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said getting foreign aid to help in the fight against the drug problem has proved futile. Mr Matshazi said the country was losing a huge chunk of its youth to the drug scourge at an alarming rate which calls for urgent solutions to fight the drug abuse. “What is concerning most is that children as young as 10 years of age are being introduced to drugs through peer pressure and lack of recreational centres which provided various services for young people in the past and are no longer existent. Parents and guardians must monitor their children and watch who they spend time with because the environment is no longer safe,” he said. Mr Matshazi said there is a lucrative industry for drug peddlers which requires stern measures to cut off the supply chains. He also urged women to be wary of skin lightening products which are on the market as some of them pose a serious health risk.  Fountain SDA Church Health Ministries director Mrs Precious Mazvimbo said the church has a role to play in the fight against drug abuse in society. “We organised this campaign to raise the challenge in the community we service. The problem of drug abuse cannot be ignored by the church since we operate in the community and we see the effects daily in the community. Above that, we are offering hope to people that Jesus is able to transform people with the drug abuse problem. We also run various programmes to help addicts to quit,” she said.
