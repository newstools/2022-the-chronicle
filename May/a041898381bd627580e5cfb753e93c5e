AFTER a two-year absence, the country’s leading Mining, Engineering and Transport exhibition bounces back in July in Bulawayo. Commonly known as Mine Entra, the specialised exhibition would be held at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair grounds between July 20 and 22. Exhibition booking space is on-going. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605478" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/zitf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/zitf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/zitf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Posting in its official Twitter account, ZITF Company said “After a 2-year hiatus, we are pleased to announce that Mine Entra is back. Book your stand now and be part of the premier gathering of mining, engineering, transport and construction industry stakeholders. #explore #extract #expand.” Last year, the exhibition was cancelled after being slated for November 3 to 5. Officials said the cancellation was necessitated by conflicting industry engagements which forestalled preparations.
In 2020, the exhibition was held virtually on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-596024" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The premier gathering of mining, engineering, transport and construction industry stakeholders provides a platform to engage in productive discussions for the creation of an enabling environment for the growth and development of the mining industry. It also incorporates a display of mining equipment, chemicals and protective clothes as well as insurance and security services which are needed by miners.  Throughout its existence, Mine Entra has successfully introduced new suppliers, ideas, technologies, services and products to an ever-increasing number of Zimbabwean mining operators. The mining industry is one of Zimbabwe’s economic mainstays with the sector presently contributing about 70 percent of the country’s foreign currency earnings. The Second Republic has come up with a US$12 billion mining industry roadmap by 2023 with the gold sector expected to generate US$4 billion, platinum US$3 billion and chrome, iron, steel, diamond and coal contributing US$1 billion. Lithium is expected to contribute US$500 million while other minerals will contribute US$1,5 billion.
