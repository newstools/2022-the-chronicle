AMINI Soma-Phiri does not need a waiver to coach in the topflight league as he is a holder of a Caf A Licence, Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede has said. Soma-Phiri,  who is in South Africa attending a funeral of a family member, was part of the last Caf A Licence class to be held in the country in 2017.  That class had, among other coaches, Mighty Warriors’ Sithetheliwe Sibanda, Darlington Dodo, Chicken Inn assistant coach Prince Matore, ZPC Kariba’s Rodwell Dhlakama and Caps United gaffer Lloyd Chitembwe. Following reports that Soma-Phiri could make a return to Highlanders on an interim basis, there were concerns that he needs a waiver to sit on the bench if he is appointed to take over from the sacked Mandla Mpofu. <img class="wp-image-606334 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rodwell-Dhlakama-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rodwell-Dhlakama-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rodwell-Dhlakama-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rodwell Dhlakama Zifa implemented standardisation for local football coaching that requires all topflight coaches to possess a Caf A Licence at the beginning of the 2017 season. Standardisation of coaches meant that Premiership gaffers and their assistants should be in possession of a Caf A badge, with a Caf B licence being a minimum requirement for First Division coaches. Division One assistant coaches are required to be holders of a Caf C or Zifa Level 4 licence. In 2018 when Soma-Phiri took charge of Bulawayo City, Zifa granted him a waiver since he had not received his Caf A badge. Other coaches that have benefitted from Zifa waivers include Chicken Inn’s Joey Antipas, Moses Chunga of Chapungu and Bulawayo Chiefs’ Thulani Sibanda. <img class="wp-image-593714 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu Clarifying Soma-Phiri’s position, Mutekede said: “Amini Soma-Phiri is a valid holder of a Caf A-Licence, which he did in 2017. There was a delay in issuance of his certificate as there was something that needed to be completed and as we speak, he has his Caf A Licence.” Highlanders have remained tight-lipped on who their next coach is after severing ties with Mpofu and his technical team members, assistant coach Bekithemba Ndlovu and goalkeepers’ coach Julius Ndlovu last week. <img class="wp-image-599638 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas Bosso are yet to dismiss reports linking them to a reunion with Soma-Phiri on a temporary basis. The club has also been linked to former Kaizer Chiefs gaffer Gavin Hunt. Highlanders are also said to have asked for a waiver to allow Joel Luphahla, the only survivor from the technical staff clean-up, to lead the first team while they continue with their search for a substantive coach. — @ZililoR
