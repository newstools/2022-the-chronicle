AS children bemoaned the absence of the joyride, the train, the jets, the shells, the boats and the big wheel associated with the Luna Park at the recently-held Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), all hope was not lost as amusement and accessories supplier, Nova Inflatables set-up the first inflatable Luna Park at Parkview Sports Club. <img class="size-full wp-image-606723" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Progress Moyo Nova Inflatables spokesperson Progress Moyo said offering an alternative form of entertainment to children was like a breath of fresh air. “We are excited to have been there to offer this kind of entertainment for children who didn’t afford to travel out of Bulawayo for the usual Luna Park. We were able to set up a wide range of jumping castles for all ages including standard castles, obstacle courses, water slides, dry slides, portable swimming pools, and trampolines,” Moyo said. “Our core business is putting smiles on children and adults’ faces who are still young at heart. Also, our mission is to create an unforgettable fun experience for the attendees for lasting blissful memories for a more whole future generation.” Moyo said they have extended their product line to mini-motorised vehicles for children at the primary level of all age groups. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606724" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “They are remote-controlled by our supervisors or driven by the children under supervision. Quad bikes are also available for the older as well.”  Nova Inflatables are on a drive to consistently offer adrenaline-pumping and high-octane entertainment. “As an amusement company, our end goal is to offer lasting blissful memories for the future generation. We’d like to open and run an amusement park, mainly in our home province, which we have noticed is lacking in that respect. An amusement park, according to Moyo, is key as it promotes physical exercise for children in a rather stressed society where children and adults are often on their computers or phones. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606732" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  “We endeavour to broaden our scope of business at the amusement park level where our services are at the client’s disposal at any time. Establishing this would help immensely to eradicate juvenile delinquent behaviour and encourage morale,” Moyo said. Those who missed out on the fun should worry not as the Inflatable Luna Park will be set up at The Place this coming weekend. “On the 14th of this month, we will be setting up at The Place for the Skulpt gym fun day and then, on the 28th, we will be at Khumalo Hockey Club.” – @eMKlass_49
