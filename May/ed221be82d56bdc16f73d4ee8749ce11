THE National Association of Primary Heads (Naph) and National Association of Secondary Heads (Nash) have applauded Government for lifting the temporary ban on schools’ sporting activities. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa announced the return of sporting activities in yesterday’s post-Cabinet briefing following a two-year ban that was part of preventive measures to contain Covid-19. Primary schools will resume all activities, while secondary schools that have reached 70 percent Covid-19 vaccination have been given the greenlight to resume non-contact sporting activities. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-609882" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-63.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-63.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-63-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “All primary schools resume all sporting activities. Secondary schools that have reached 70% Covid-19 second dose vaccination can resume non-contact sporting activities. In embracing the new normal, Cabinet has approved the following measures: that provincial medical directors in collaboration with provincial education directors submit on a weekly basis a list of schools in their provinces that meet the 70 percent second dose Covid-19,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. <img class="size-full wp-image-609885" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-64.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-64.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-64-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sports Nash president Arthur Maphosa welcomed the partial return of sport, saying secondary schools will be done with their vaccination before June. “We welcome the Government’s decision for sport to return in schools and with extracurricular activities, we can arrest social ills among learners, who will use their spare time on sport. Even though we are starting with non-contact activities, we are confident that we will soon start ball games when the vaccination programme is complete,” said Maphosa.  His Naph counterpart Cynthia Khumalo said: “This is wonderful news. This is welcome news from our Government and we’re very excited that at least the return of sport will bring morale to teachers and children. It will also help in bringing change to discipline.”
Khumalo said they will be activating plans that they had on return to sport at public schools, with activities likely to start next week. While Government lifted the ban yesterday, private schools and some former Group A schools have been playing rugby. The schools played matches at the weekend, with St George’s losing 13-33 to St John’s, while Churchill Bulls beat Prince Edward 25-15 and Falcon College overwhelmed Christian Brothers College 32-7. Milton High School and Plumtree High drew 18-18.— @ZililoR
