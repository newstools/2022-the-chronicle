The Chronicle EVERTON manager Frank Lampard has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association (FA) for the comments he made after his team lost 2-0 away to Merseyside rivals Liverpool last month. Lampard criticised referee Stuart Attwell after he did not award a penalty for a challenge on Everton’s Anthony Gordon, with the manager suggesting that the spot kick would have been given if the challenge had been made on a Liverpool player. <img class="size-full wp-image-606253" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Stuart-Attwell.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Stuart-Attwell.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Stuart-Attwell-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stuart Attwell.
