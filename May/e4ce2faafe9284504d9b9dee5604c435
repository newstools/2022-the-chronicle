The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MEXICAN Javier Martinez Espinosa is reportedly the favourite to land the vacant Highlanders’ coaching job that has seen a number of foreign coaches jostling for the post a week after the club parted ways with Mandla Mpofu. Club sources said Martinez, who has had coaching stints with Vipers SC and Rayon Sports in Uganda, has charmed Bosso executives. <img class="wp-image-611697 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-31.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-31.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-31-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mohamed Fathi According to transfermarkt.com, Martinez has been unemployed since his sacking by Rayon Sports in December 2020 after being in charge for 94 days at the club. He had spent four months at Vipers. Before moving to Uganda, Martinez is listed as having been assistant coach at Cruz Azul in his country between January 2016 and July 2016. He then moved to Carcha as head coach in July 2016 and left the club in October. His next head coach job was at Juventus Managua from July 2017 to December 2017. Other coaches that have submitted their CVs for job include their former gaffers Mark Harrison and Mohamed Fathi. Harrison joined Highlanders at the beginning of 2020 and only took charge of one match, the Castle Challenge Cup, which Bosso lost 0-2 to league champions FC Platinum. <img class="size-full wp-image-611698" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-32.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-32.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-32-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Philani ‘Beefy Ncube The Briton and Highlanders then mutually suspended his contract due to inactivity caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020. Egyptian Fathi joined Highlanders in September 2009, taking over from Madinda Ndlovu, and left in the middle of the season, leaving Mkhupahli Masuku in charge.  Bosso finished fifth in 2009 with 43 points, 18 behind that year’s champions Gunners. The season Fathi left, Bosso finished third with 57 points, nine behind winners Motor Action, who won the title on a superior goal difference over Dynamos. <img class="wp-image-594664 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Obert-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Obert-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Obert-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> former Mines and Mining Development Minister Obert Mpofu However, what could work against Fathi is that he took Highlanders to court to recover US$22 000 that the club owed him; an amount which was eventually paid by former Mines and Mining Development Minister Obert Mpofu. Serbian Heric Vladislav, who has had stints with South African sides Chippa United, Cape Town Spurs, Free State Stars, Ajax Cape Town and Maritzburg United, has also expressed interest in bossing the Bosso dugout. Vladislav stated in his resume that he coached Tunisian side Club Africain between 2004 and 2007, guiding them to the league title and also quarter-finals of the Caf Champions League during that period. The Serbian said while at Ajax Cape Town, he also worked with their development side producing players who went on to compete in the European leagues. Former Bulawayo City coach Philani ‘Beefy’ Ncube is said to have submitted his CV. <img class="wp-image-611703 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-33.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-33.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-33-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City FC Ncube was released by Bulawayo City FC less than a month ago after failing to get positive results with the municipal side. Sources said the executive is working “tirelessly” to get a coach soon. “There has been an overwhelming interest in the vacant coaching job. Some of the coaches have served the club before and of interest to note is that there are a number of foreign applicants. “The executive is sifting through the applications, looking for the best, affordable coach who will add value to the club. While the club understands the urgency in getting a substantive coach, the executive wants to do due diligence,” said the source. — @ZililoR
