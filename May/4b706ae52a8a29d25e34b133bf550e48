SIKANDAR Raza has been fined 50 percent of his match fee for breaching Level 1 of the International Cricket Council Code of Conduct during the Men’s T20 International against Namibia at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Tuesday.  According to a statement from the world cricket governing body, Raza breached Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match”. In addition, two demerit points have been added to Raza’s disciplinary record, as it was his first offence in a 24-month period, taking his cumulative demerit points to two. <img class="size-full wp-image-610090" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-46-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-46-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-46-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andy Pycroft “The incident occurred in the 16th over of Zimbabwe’s innings when Raza was given out lbw. He questioned the decision by showing his bat to the umpire, used inappropriate words about the decision numerous times as he was leaving the field of play, and shouted his displeasure again as he entered the dressing room,” reads the ICC statement. Raza admitted to the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Andy Pycroft and as such, there was no need for a formal hearing. <img class="size-full wp-image-610095" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-47-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Langton Rusere On-field umpires Iknow Chabi and Langton Rusere as well as third umpire Forster Mutizwa levelled the charges.
