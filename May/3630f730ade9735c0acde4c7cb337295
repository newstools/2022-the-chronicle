The Chronicle AFTER losing the first match, home-side Nepal came out tops against Zimbabwe A in the third unofficial T20I cricket match at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur yesterday. <img class="size-full wp-image-606216" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tribhuvan-University-International-Cricket.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tribhuvan-University-International-Cricket.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tribhuvan-University-International-Cricket-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground With the victory, Nepal levelled the three-match series 1-1. After winning the toss, Nepal skipper Sandeep Lamichanne decided to field first and his decision was proven right, as Zimbabwe opener Innocent Kaia and Kudzai Maunze got out cheaply. Tadiwanashe Marumani held the innings for his team for some time before being scalped by Lamichanne. <img class="size-full wp-image-606223" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tadiwanashe-Marumani.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tadiwanashe-Marumani.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tadiwanashe-Marumani-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tadiwanashe Marumani Batter Roy Kaia was exceptional for the visitors as he scored a vital 49 runs for his team before being run out. Skipper Tony Munyonga and wicketkeeper batsman Clive Madande could not get going, but a decent knock from Luke Jongwe ensured the visitors crossed the 135-run mark. For Nepal, Lamichhane (two wickets), Basir Ahamad (one wicket) and Sompal Kami (one wicket) were the successful bowlers.
Chasing just 137 to win, Nepal’s opening batters Kushal Bhurtel (34 off 26 balls) and the wicketkeeper-batter Aasif Sheikh (87 off 54 balls) went berserk as the Zimbabwe bowlers had no clue. The home side lost their first wicket on 88 runs, with Bhurtel getting scalped by Brandon Mavuta.  Sheikh was then joined by Basir Ahamad (10 off 15 balls). The duo took the home side total past the 100-run mark before Ahamad was scalped by Jongwe in the 15th over. However, Nepal did not stutter in their chase after that as they completed the run chase in 15.5 overs without losing any further wickets. Opener Aasif Sheikh was adjudged Player of the Match for his excellent knock with the bat. <img class="size-full wp-image-606228" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Aasif-Sheikh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Aasif-Sheikh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Aasif-Sheikh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Aasif Sheikh For the visitors, Jongwe and Mavuta were the only successful bowlers as none of the other bowlers, including Victor Nyauchi, Trevor Gwandu and Brad Evans got any wickets. The visitors will take on Nepal in an unofficial one-day series next. – Crictracker
