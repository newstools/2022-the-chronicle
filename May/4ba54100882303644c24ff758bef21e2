The beneficiary, the SI states, should not be under any disciplinary proceedings. “If such motor vehicle is procured using a loan availed under the Transport Purchase Fund managed through CMED (Private) Limited or the serving public servant’s own resources; and intended solely for the private and business use of the serving public servant and not for commercial or trade purposes; the Secretary responsible for Finance and Economic Development may, according to his or her discretion and further to the conditions stated herein, grant a rebate of duty on a motor vehicle imported by any serving public servant of Zimbabwe, excluding serving public servants in the health sector below the Deputy Director Grade,” reads part of the SI. The SI further states that the maximum import value of any motor vehicle shall not be more than maximum amounts agreed per grade. “The public servant must have been in the Civil Service or Service Commissions for a period of not less than ten years in the case of any motor vehicles to be purchased after 31st March, 2022. Only one motor vehicle may be imported by a serving public servant under rebate,” reads part of the SI.  “The maximum amounts shall be as follows Grade B and C US$3 500, D and E US$5 000 Deputy Director US$10 000. No rebate shall be granted by the Commissioner in terms of this section unless the serving public servant furnishes him or her with an application letter to be considered as a beneficiary in terms of this section, recommendation letter from the responsible Permanent Secretary confirming employment, a copy of the intended beneficiary serving public servant’s driver’s licence, a purchase invoice for the motor vehicle being imported, approval letter from CMED (Private) Limited for the loan in the case of funding from the CMED Transport Purchase Fund.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-605353 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-54-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-54-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-54-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The SI states that the Secretary may only grant a rebate for motor vehicles purchased from traceable and registered car dealers and can request for proof of source of funds. In consideration of an application for a rebate, the SI said the Commissioner may revalue the motor vehicle in line with the existing customs valuation regulations in cases where he or she suspects undervaluation of the motor vehicle; or disqualify any applicant that wilfully undervalues a motor vehicle imported in terms of this rebate. “Any serving public servant who imports or takes out of bond a motor vehicle in terms of this section including motor vehicles purchased on or before 31st March, 2022 shall be required to clear for consumption the motor vehicle by 31st May, 2022, failing which full duty due on the vehicle shall become payable,” said the SI.
