IN Gweru City Centre, there are four pushcarts that attract people’s attention. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612904 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-139.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-139.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-139-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> They are not ordinary pushcarts with fresh fruit. These pushcarts are filled with cabbages, grapes and a variety of fresh produce and it’s possible because they are bigger than the ordinary pushcarts. The ordinary pushcarts also tend to have a lack of variety as the vendors always have one type of fruit which can be apples or bananas. But in these bigger pushcarts, there is variety which has made them popular with residents and travellers. What attracts customers is first the loud music as they all have those modern speakers which play flash drives. The pushcarts are painted green and have branded tents that cover the top inscribed Golden Crystal Fruit Ways. The pushcart operators are so mobile that one might think that there are more than four of them in town. But who is the brains behind these unique pushcarts? They are run by two men; Mr Jacob Maredza (30) and his partner Mr Emmanuel Mapundu (27). Messrs Maredza and Mapundu are former vendors at Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus in Gweru and are spreading their wings in the fresh produce business  They are now proud employers of four boys who operate the pushcarts and one who is manning their fresh produce shop along 6th avenue in the city centre. The two met at the terminus, clicked and thought of coming up with a partnership which led to the formation and registration of their company which is called Golden Crystal Fruit Ways. They are also paying taxes to the Government thereby contributing to the economic growth of the country. <img class="wp-image-586850 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-9-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-9-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-9-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The refurbished Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus in Gweru In an interview at their base yesterday afternoon, Mr Maredza said it all started at Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus. “I started vending from Kudzanayi bus terminus selling fruits to passengers through windows or going inside the buses which was a hustle but it had to be done. I would also put the fruits in those small general pushcarts popularly known as scanias,” he said. Mr Maredza said in 2016, he met Mr Nqobile Gazi who had a vision of having big and attractive pushcarts that would go around the city centre. “The problem with the ordinary pushcarts was that we would be relegated to the rank or along Second or First street. This is because the council police didn’t want and still don’t want the unregistered pushcarts in the CBD,” he said. “There is one person I owe this success to, the one person who had this vision called Nqobile Gazi, he is the founder or had this vision which we have now implemented. He mooted this idea of having these big pushcarts which can accommodate a lot of fresh produce, compared to the ordinary pushcarts. “But we failed to do anything because of financial incapacitation until I met Emmanuel Mapundu. We put our heads together and thought that this business should take us far, it should grow. Money was needed and we looked for it through selling fruits at Kudzanayi,” said Mr Maredza. He said the pushcart is quite unique to customers. “We can put all fruits and vegetables such as bananas, tomatoes, green beans, peas, cabbages, apples, grapes you name it. It’s a one-stop shop,” said Mr Maredza. <img class="size-full wp-image-612391" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-45-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> covid-19 He said two years ago — when others were crying because of the negative effects of the Covid-19 induced lockdown — they saw an opportunity to grow their business. “When Covid-19 pandemic led to the lockdown, we registered Golden Crystal Fruit Ways. Since agriculture was put under essential services during the Covid 19 pandemic forced lockdown we were able to open for business and we grew,” said Mr Maredza. He said Golden Crystal has four well designed pushcarts that go around. “We have also diversified and are now selling isitshwala and pies and we do door-to-door deliveries. The pushcarts are operated by four employees who go around town selling fruits and vegetables to residents and travellers,” said Mr Maredza. <img class="wp-image-479203 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Gweru-City-Council-town-house.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Gweru-City-Council-town-house.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Gweru-City-Council-town-house-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gweru City Council He said since they are registered, they don’t face problems with Gweru City Council police who are always in cat and mouse games with unregistered vendors who trade on pavements and or undesignated points. Mr Maredza who is married with two children said he went up to A-level but did not pursue further education as he returned to Kudzanayi Long Distance Bus Terminus to pursue his passion in vending. “I started vending at a very tender age. I grew up in Gweru and by the time I was in Grade 7, I knew my talent was in vending or selling things. By Grade 7 I was selling tomatoes and maize meal. I was once employed but could not embrace the idea of working under someone. In 2015 I got married and I can pay my own rentals and look after my family. We now have a fruit market and we have everything. There is sadza, eggs, pies as well,” he said. Mr Mapundu said he grew up in Gokwe and relocated to Gweru in 2012. “I met Maredza while we were both vending. I saw that he was a hard worker and we thought of buying our stuff in bulk and expanding our business which was not a bad idea since he is also a hard worker,” he said. Mr Mapundu said the need to become employers drove him to work hard in the vending business. “My motivation comes from the fact that I wanted to be a bit different. I didn’t like the idea of working for someone. Now we are employers and plans are underway to open other fruits and vegetable shops,” he said. Mr Mapundu who is still single said he can pay rentals and look after his parents from the business. One of their employees is Tatenda Moyo (19) from Gokwe who said he is working so that he can raise money to collect his O-level results. “I am working for these guys because I am looking for money to go and collect my O-level certificates. I get 10 percent from the sales I make and I’m grateful to Jacob and Emmanuel who came up with this idea,” he said.
