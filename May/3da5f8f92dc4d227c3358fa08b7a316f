ZIFA Southern Region Division One side Binga Pirates are expected to appear before the disciplinary committee this week following skirmishes they sparked in their 1-2 loss to ZPC Hwange in Binga last month. Binga Pirates fans attacked referee Hardly Ndazi for alleged poor officiating at the end of the match after ZPC Hwange came from a goal down to beat the hosts.  Ndazi was savaged for awarding an alleged dubious penalty to ZPC Hwange. According to reports, a member of the Binga Pirates’ technical staff pushed Ndazi and then the fans attacked the referee. “The team will face the disciplinary committee this week. We have already written to the club to advise them about the hearing. Now the responsibility is on the disciplinary committee, which is independent from the executive. Once they come up with a determination, it will be up to the executive to act on that determination,” said Zifa Southern Region chairperson Andrew Tapela. <img class="size-full wp-image-605530" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Referee-assaulted-in-Binga.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Referee-assaulted-in-Binga.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Referee-assaulted-in-Binga-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Binga Pirates fans attacking referee Hardly Ndazi Meanwhile, Hwange FC continued with their fine form in the league after notching up their 12th win of the season by beating Indosakusa 1-0 at White City Stadium.
