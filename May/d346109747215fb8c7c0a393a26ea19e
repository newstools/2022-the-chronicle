Namibia 161/4 20 overs (Erasmus 58*, Van Lingen 51, Erasmus, Jongwe 2/35, Raza 1/20, Chatara 1/24) beat Zimbabwe 157/8 20 overs (Madhevere 50, Mutumbami 27, Scholtz 3/25) by six wickets
NAMIBIA levelled the five-match Twenty20 International cricket series with a six-wicket win in a tense fourth match at Queens Sports Club yesterday.  The result left the series tied 2-2 with the decider to go. Zane Green slammed the last ball of the match bowled by Tendai Chatara for a boundary to seal the win for the Namibians right at the end. In response to Zimbabwe’s total of 157/8 in 20 overs, Namibia struck 161/4, with their highest run scorer being skipper Gerhard Erasmus, whose unbeaten 58 won him the man of the match, while opening batsman Michael van Lingen was second best with 51 runs. <img class="wp-image-610864 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-9-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-9-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-9-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wessley Madhevere raises his bat after reaching the half century mark Namibia’s win means there is all to play for in the fifth and final T20I at the same venue tomorrow.
Zimbabwe looked well set to post a score in the region of 200 runs when Wesley Madhevere gave them a brilliant start. The opener raced to his 50 off 30 balls, but was run out going for a tight single two balls later. From there, it all fell apart for the home team, as it struggled for runs with the next notable contribution coming from Richmond Mutumbami (27). <img class="wp-image-610867 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-10-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-10-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-10-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine has a word with pace bowler Tendai Chatara Zimbabwe had got an early breakthrough when Chatara trapped Craig Williams leg before wicket for one run.
Some sloppy fielding saw Zimbabwe loosen the screws on Namibia. It eventually came down to the last over bowled by Chatara, with Erasmus and Green at the crease. The first delivery was a dot ball, with singles coming off the next two balls, while the next was a leg bye followed by a single before Green hit the last ball for a boundary.
