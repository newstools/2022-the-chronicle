The musician who is now based in Bulawayo said the training will help performing artistes, better stage-manage their sets. “The masterclass is aimed at equipping musicians and performing artistes with enough knowledge to design and set up lighting for their performance sets. Sometimes, one gets on stage and they don’t know what to wear to make the stage look better. The overall lookout hinges on the type of lighting done as well as how one looks,” Tariro neGitare said. She reiterated the need for performing artistes to build and understand the relationship that they should have with a lighting engineer. “I’d like to encourage performing artistes to come and learn as much as they can so that we can improve our stage presentation.  It’s such a blessing to be able to learn from our own. We can only build each other when we leverage the ecosystem so that we can improve,” she said. Interested performing artistes are required to apply and register on or before 16 June via sending a one-page motivation letter and application forms to Phenomenal Lighting and Power Solutions email address – admin@phenomenallighting.com Moyo, a bona fide lighting engineer who hosted stage lighting training in Harare earlier this month said working with her “dear friend” will be good for both parties. “Tari is a dear friend of mine and I anticipate great things from our first project together next month. I think besides benefiting the artistes, our brands will also benefit in the process,” she said. Also known as the “lighting bae”, Moyo is renowned for her work at the European Film Festival, Shoko Festival, Zimbabwe Jazz Festival, Harare International Festival of the Arts, Zimbabwe German Society shows, plays at Reps Theatre and Intwasa Arts Festival. <img class="wp-image-612913 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Intwasa Arts Festival Moyo is London-bound and will be attending school soon at Rose Bruford College where she will get to meet her iconic lighting designer, Patrick Woodroffe.
