The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief The recently launched National Social Security Authority (NSSA) self-service portal, which is in line with the organisation’s vision to become a world class social security provider by 2030, is set to give contributors unlimited access to their accounts. <img class="wp-image-605623 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Social Security Authority(NSSA) The portal, which was necessitated by Covid-19 restrictions that limited people’s movements to access NSSA offices, allows employers and employees to check and update contribution information. It also allows members to verify and update member details as well as check if contribution history, employment history and personal details are correct. Through the self-service portal, members can also submit claims and report accidents. Speaking on the side-lines of a contributor’s engagement meeting in Gwanda, NSSA general manager Mr Arthur Manase said the portal had created space for contributors to update their NSSA records online. “We no longer need to have gatherings or queues at NSSA offices. Everything is done at the member’s convenience and this will also speed up pension benefit processing so that the moment a person has a claim, it is expeditiously processed,” said Mr Manase. He said the pensions authority was engaged in a drive to grow its income projects to improve the welfare of pensioners while helping create more employment opportunities. “We know that pensions will never be adequate so we’re continuing with our struggle to ensure that pensioners have other income generating activities to embark on to make sure that they improve their livelihoods. We’re continuing with our revolving loans so that pensioners can start income generating projects. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607987" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We’re continuing with our goat rearing projects which will create additional revenue streams for pensioners. We’re also engaging in economic activities which will also afford pensioners added revenue. Some projects will be announced soon where pensioners can be our partners and that way we enhance their livelihoods,” said Mr Manase. He pledged that NSSA will continue to review the pensioners’ pay-outs in keeping with the prevailing changes in the macro-economic environment. “Firstly, we are looking at continuous reviews of pensions and this is what we have been doing since last year. We have increased pensions from what they were around this time, at US$12 if converted to the exchange rate to what they are now US$70 at the official exchange rate. Soon we are going to US$80 equivalent and by the end of this year, we will be over US$100 equivalent using the official rate. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607990" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This is far in excess of the international standard, as you know the International Labour Organisation stipulates that for a pensioner to live a decent life, pensioners must get at least US$2 per day,” said Mr Manase. He said NSSA was also seized with expanding its non-monetary benefits to cushion pensioners, which has seen the authority availing a loan scheme for income generating projects.  “As you might know we have introduced a revolving loan facility for pensioners where they can go to banks and the leading banks as far as this is concerned are NBS and POSB while other banks are joining. Pensioners apply for loans at concessional interest rates and they engage in income generating projects like keeping cattle, goats, piggery and things like that,” said Mr Manase. A goat rearing project had already been set up in Matshetsheni, Gwanda District, where plans were on course to contract farmers. — @Yolisswa
