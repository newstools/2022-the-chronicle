PENSIONERS in Gwanda have started benefiting from a fully equipped mobile clinic which will be run by the National Social Security Authority (Nssa) in the mining town for a month as part of its medical outreach programme. The mobile clinic, which will also be moving around mines in the province for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumoconiosis among miners, will be providing services free of charge. The medical outreach programme is part of efforts by the social security provider to cushion pensioners with non-monetary benefits in addition to their pension pay-outs. <img class="size-full wp-image-605634" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Miner – Image taken from Shuttersock One of the beneficiaries of the mobile clinic, Ms Agenia Ndlovu from Gwanda town applauded the initiative saying it was of great help as they also received their prescribed medicines from the clinic. Ms Ndlovu said her husband died in 2003 and she has been receiving a pension and benefits since then. “Now that some of us are old, we need to keep a close eye on our health. The mobile clinic has been very helpful as we can be treated without paying anything. We’ve also managed to access some medication through this clinic so we’re very grateful for it,” said Ms Ndlovu. <img class="size-full wp-image-605626" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mobile clinic Another pensioner, Mr Regis Mare said medication is expensive and the mobile clinic had lightened the load. “Although some have clinics and other health facilities close to their homes, the biggest challenge is accessing the medication. We don’t receive a lot of money as pensioners and some of the medication we take is expensive. This clinic has been very helpful as we can consult the doctors and receive treatment free of charge,” said Mr Mare. Pensioners have also received other non-monetary benefits such as grocery allowances, discounted grocery schemes with SPAR and the OK group of stores, a waiver of bank charges for Nssa pensioners who bank with NBS and POSB as well as a revolving fund with POSB and NBS where pensioners can get loans at subsidised rates for income-generating projects. <img class="size-full wp-image-605631" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> POSB Nssa general manager Mr Arthur Manase said pensioners are set to benefit from empowerment projects such as goat farming out grower schemes to enable generation of extra income. “Conscious of the fact that social security pay-outs can never be sufficient anywhere in the world, Nssa went a step further by coming up with various non-monetary benefits in collaboration with its partners,” said Mr Manase.
He said the Government had authorised a pay-out increment which was yet to be gazetted. “We’ve heard from pensioners that the current pay-outs are inadequate. As Nssa, we’re determined to enrich the lives of our pensioners. We’ve committed to periodic pension reviews and I’m happy to announce that the Government has authorised an increment which we’re going to implement soon and it will be backdated to April 1. <img class="size-full wp-image-525487" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Arthur-Manase.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Arthur-Manase.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Arthur-Manase-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Arthur Manase Our pensioners have something to look out for. We know that pensions will never be adequate so we’re continuing with our struggle to ensure that pensioners have other income-generating activities to embark on to make sure that they improve their livelihoods,” he said. “We’re continuing with our revolving loans so that pensioners can start income-generating projects. We’re continuing with our goat rearing projects which will create additional revenue streams for pensioners. We’re also engaging in economic activities which will also afford pensioners added revenue. We have a mobile clinic where pensioners can receive quality medical care. Some projects will be announced soon where pensioners can be our partners and that way, we enhance their livelihoods.” — @Yolisswa
