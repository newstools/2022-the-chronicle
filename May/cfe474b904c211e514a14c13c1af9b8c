The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter THE Joshua Nkomo Legacy Restoration Project Trust (JNLRPT) has welcomed plans to replace the shield signage at the Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport with the country’s coat of arms saying the move represents the late Father Zimbabwe’s nationalistic vision. <img class="wp-image-590143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Joshua-Mqabuko-Nkomo-International-airport.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Joshua-Mqabuko-Nkomo-International-airport.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Joshua-Mqabuko-Nkomo-International-airport-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International airport The Airport Company of Zimbabwe (ACZ) last Friday removed the shield at the airport causing an uproar particularly on social media platforms. Members of the public accused the ACZ of disregarding the cultural significance of the shield. This resulted in Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona clarifying the incident saying the shield had been temporarily put when the airport was upgraded and commissioned in 2013. He said ACZ was in the process of designing permanent signage for the country’s airports as it embarks on the exercise to meet International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. Minister Mhona said consultations will be done with other stakeholders to come up with the new signage. <img class="wp-image-608523 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) In a statement, the chairperson of the JNLRPT Mr Mehluli Moyo said the national symbol that has been placed at the airport represents Father Zimbabwe’s national outlook and vision and is welcomed. He said as Government rebrands the airport, it should consider erecting a statue of the late Father Zimbabwe at the port of entry. “As the JNLRPT we view the decision by Government to put up the coat of arms emblem on the signage at the Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport as correct and in line with what Joshua Nkomo stood for during his entire life, which he dedicated towards building a nation of Zimbabwe.  <img class="wp-image-608527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-14-copy-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-14-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-14-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Heroes Acre It goes without saying that Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo himself, whose remains are interred at the National Heroes Acre, would have been happy to have his name associated with the national emblem,” said Mr Moyo. He said it was necessary for Government to have announced the changes before removing the shield at the airport. “As an organisation that promotes his legacy, we however believe that a consultation process with stakeholders should have been done by Government to clarify the idea behind the changes of the symbols at the airport named after Father Zimbabwe. The mixed reactions from our people indicate the need to have more engagements in the future before taking decisions,” he said.  “As JNLRPT we have been very consistent in pushing and lobbying Government to do more in making sure that Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo is portrayed as a true national hero and for that reason we openly welcome the changes at the airport.” <img class="wp-image-556926 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/The-late-Dr-Joshua-Nkomo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo Mr Moyo reiterated the call to declare July 1 a public holiday in honour of Dr Nkomo who died on the day in 1999. “We further make a special call to the Government of Zimbabwe to consider declaring 1 July a public holiday to honour Father Zimbabwe,” said Mr Moyo. — @nqotshili
