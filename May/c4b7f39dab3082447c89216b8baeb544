HIGHLANDERS’ defender Andrew Tandi’s season appears to be over after fracturing his right fibula (calf bone) and dislocating his ankle in the abandoned Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. A quick search on footballers with fractured fibula showed that recovery periods range between three and six months depending on the gravity.  Highlanders’ medical team has recommended specialised treatment for the defender, who was the victim of a horror tackle by Dynamos’ winger Bill Antonio in the 68th minute and was rushed to hospital after the Bosso medical team led by Shepherd Khumalo responded quickly to reduce the ankle (put it back into place). They reassured a clearly shaken Tandi, while his central defence partner Peter Muduhwa wept when he realised the extent of the injury. <img class="size-full wp-image-609121" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-defender-Andrew-Tandi-being-taken-off-the-pitch-after-suffering-a-horrific-injury.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-defender-Andrew-Tandi-being-taken-off-the-pitch-after-suffering-a-horrific-injury.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Highlanders-defender-Andrew-Tandi-being-taken-off-the-pitch-after-suffering-a-horrific-injury-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders defender Andrew Tandi being taken off the pitch after suffering a horrific injury Quick reaction by the medical team prevented more harm to the injury that comes with damage to the ankle ligaments, and in this case with his ankle rotating outwards, it is most likely the inner ligaments. The specialist will determine whether Tandi needs a plaster or has to be operated on and have a plate inserted. Highlanders have already booked a specialist, who will determine the extent of the injury. The Bosso defender had a scan yesterday where it was discovered that he fractured the right fibula. In September last year, 18-year-old Liverpool player Elliot Harvey fractured his fibula in a match against Leeds and only returned to training four months later before making his return when The Kops beat Cardiff 3-1 in an FA Cup match. Everton midfielder Andre Gomes had minimal ligament damage and returned to training in three months. <img class="size-full wp-image-609429" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andre-Gomes.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andre-Gomes.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andre-Gomes-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andre Gomes. Image taken from The Sun Leicester’s Wesley Fofana was ruled out for seven months following a fibula fracture that led to severe ligament damage. What should be taken into account is that the above players were taken to top medical facilities, with fabulous rehabilitation services, some of which are not available locally. Returning to training isn’t the end of the recovery process, as players will still have to deal with fitness issues, other injury risks as intensity ramps up and low confidence or fear of movement/re-injury. With the PSL season set to end between November and December, it’s unlikely that Tandi will play any further part in Highlanders’ campaign, although he assured his teammates that he will return to action in an audio sent to their WhatsApp group from his hospital bed. Antonio also issued a public apology, saying it wasn’t his intention to hurt Tandi and wished the Bosso defender a speedy recovery. – @ZililoR
