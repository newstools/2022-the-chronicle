THE Zimbabwe School of Mines (ZSM) is expected to play a leading role in the beneficiation and value addition of minerals as the country drives towards achieving a US$12 billion mining industry milestone by 2023, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura, has said. The Second Republic is pushing for value addition of the country’s natural resources including precious minerals for the country to benefit more from its resources. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-583172" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> As a mining training centre, Deputy Minister Kambamura, said ZSM should be well equipped to unlock more opportunities in the sector. Speaking during handover of critical equipment in the Metallurgical Assaying Laboratory by Mimosa Mining Company last Thursday, Deputy Minister Kambamura said Vision 2030 demands that ZSM responds by providing skills, particularly in the emerging minerals being mined in Zimbabwe. “Therefore, a fully equipped laboratory plays a critical role in training of human capital. Furthermore, on servicing the industry the laboratory has also been very useful to the mining and related industries, providing services that include water analysis for EMA regulations compliance, gold, silver and base metals analysis, coal analysis and metallurgical tests works,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-605413" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe School of Mines Mimosa donated a range of equipment for the geological department that includes four geological microscopes equipment with a camera and digital connectivity to enable online sharing of thin section images by lecturers and students. The metallurgy department was equipped with a single pot ring mill and machinery for sample analysis. With the current expansion in the mining industry, Deputy Minister Kambamura said ZSM is expected to conduct test work in the new mining processing methods on emerging mineral such as base metals. “We expect ZMS to match international standards by being assessed and successfully accredited by the Southern Africa Development Community Acceptation Services (SADCAS) on an ISO/EC17025:2005, which will demonstrate that it is technically competent and able to produce precise and accurate tests and analyses of minerals,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-605425" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mining – Image taken from Pixabay “Accreditation of this Metallurgical Laboratory requires this equipment in line with industry standardisation needs.” However, ZSM cannot achieve its responsibilities alone as its needs partners with other players in the industry, said the Deputy Minister. “The Government of Zimbabwe pleads with the mining industry sector to partner with technical institution of this nature in retooling laboratories,” he added. “In line with the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan the Metallurgical Assay Laboratory has been infused as a strategic Business Development Unit, therefore donations of the equipment is perfectly suited in the grand strategy.” The mining industry is a key pillar of Zimbabwe’s economy as it generates much of the needed foreign currency.
ZSM principal, Mr Edwin Gwaze, said since their laboratory was fully equipped, the training centre is now able to operate at a commercial level where both solid and liquid samples are processed. <img class="size-full wp-image-605416" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-2-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-2-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Edwin Gwaze He said the donation confirms Mimosa’s commitment to ensure that ZSM provides unrelenting quality services to the mining industry. Over the years, Mimosa has made several donations, which include a 29-seater bus, assisted in training assets for the library and boulder for the mining museum. Mimosa head of engineering, Mr Admire Makuvaro, said their support is intended to capacitate ZSM to continue producing quality graduates.  “As Mimosa we have responded to the needs of the Zimbabwe School of Mines through various developmental partnerships over the years and we remain committed to working with the institution as it develops and continue to improve its service to the mining industry,” he said. “We urge the Zimbabwe School of Mines to make use of the equipment in line with the Governments vision for the institution to become a hub for experimentation and research in mining.”
