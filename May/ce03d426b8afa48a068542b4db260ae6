LONG-DISTANCE runner Isaac Mpofu says he is taking his misfortune at the Durban International Marathon in KwaZulu-Natal last Sunday as motivation to work extra hard. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608394" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mpofu was left devastated after race organisers stripped him of victory in the 42.2km race he had won in a time of 2 hours 10.04 seconds and the R50 000 prize money for failing to display two licence numbers on his bib. Athletics South Africa (ASA) ruled that the ZRP Club runner was disqualified according to the rules because he only had one licence number.  ASA said the rules were clear that participants in the Durban International Marathon had to wear two licence numbers in the race.
The 33-year-old Mpofu said he was in high spirits despite the mishap.
