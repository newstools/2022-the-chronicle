WOMEN’S great powers of creativity, resilience, and extraordinary tales have created stories that exemplify the ultimate force of womanhood while bringing beauty to their special life. Females are working tirelessly to structure their thoughts and superpowers as they struggle to make ends meet and fiercely create history in their own culture. For women specifically, their stories can be even more unique and impactful as they navigate various challenges explicitly to their gender such as misperceptions about their skills’ set.  Several approaches taken by tenacious female entrepreneurs have created strong waves in the business community, thus laying a solid base of limitless creativity. Such is the story of Bulawayo-based entrepreneur Ms Patscencia Vundla (45), who started off as a waitress before venturing into her own enterprise in the tourism and hospitality industry. Growing up in a rural set up at Solusi in Matabeleland South province, Ms Vundla had a tough upbringing, albeit punctuated by resilience, determination and hope. Following the death of her father at a tender age, she was raised by her grandparents, and drawing inspiration from her grandfather, a peasant farmer who despite tilling a small piece of land, eked out a decent living through subsistent farming. <img class="wp-image-607128 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Warwick university After completing her O-Level studies, Ms Vundla went to South Africa where she got a job as a waitress, rising through the ranks to a shop floor manager at the age of 23 years. She later relocated to the United Kingdom where she did menial jobs while continuing with her studies until she obtained a Bachelor’s degree in social sciences from the University of Warwick in 2014. While in the UK, she decided to start her own butchery and traditional food business in Coventry and Wolverhampton. In 2019, she decided to return home and set up her own business, channelling her passion for cooking into a thriving enterprise. Today, she is the proud owner of True Elegance restaurants, whose cuisine has taken over the city by storm through its traditional meals and self-oriented service. <img class="size-full wp-image-607125" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> True Elegance The eatery was last year named the best restaurant in the country at the Hospitality Awards. Ms Vundla also operates an events management company and is also a tour operator, offering local and international excursions. She also owns a farm and a lodge, employing a total of 100 people. She is loving her entrepreneurial journey and believes the sky is the limit. “There was a lot of skepticism from my friends in the UK when I told them that I intended to invest back home and I almost abandoned my plans. Businesses hold no prejudices when it comes to creativity and new innovations, which is the reason I decided to proceed with my plans,” she said. Through her impressive inventions, Ms Vundla, a mother of four, has set her eyes on expanding her business venture and diversifying investments. So far, she has three restaurants in Bulawayo, Beitbridge and Lupane. “We started out as a small company, but we have grown to have three branches in Bulawayo, Beitbridge and Lupane and created direct employment for over 50 people and 100 indirectly. Our main focus varies from being an up-class restaurant where we serve only the best delicious, elegant dishes, both traditional and western,” said Ms Vundla. “We have the best private dining rooms, outdoor and take-away services. As women entrepreneurs, is it important to wash out the traditional norms that women cannot be pioneers of flourishing start-ups.” Ms Vundla said the challenge she encountered upon relocating back home was the Covid-19 disruption. “It wasn’t easy because there was no business activity and during that time, I also fell ill to an extent that I thought I would die. After recovering from my sickness, that is when I opened my first restaurant True Elegance, which is located at 1st Avenue and Joshua Nkomo Street in Bulawayo.” As a female entrepreneur, Ms Vundla believes that women can conquer anything they want with the right mindset and goals. As part of celebrating Mother’s Day yesterday, Ms Vundla organised a special event for mothers at Fourwinds suburb in Bulawayo where they were treated to a luncheon, among other activities. — @mashnets
