FOCUS will be on the country’s traditional giants Dynamos and Highlanders when Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches resume next weekend after they both fired their coaches and backroom staff. Highlanders fired head coach Mandla Mpofu, his assistant Bekithemba Ndlovu and goalkeepers’ trainer Julius Ndlovu on Tuesday last week, two days after their league match against Dynamos was abandoned in the 92nd minute following crowd violence. <img class="wp-image-599631 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu Fitness trainer Harold Nhachi and welfare manager Vezigama Dlodlo had also been released but the club had a change of heart and retained the two. Second assistant coach Joel Luphahla, a late addition to the Bosso technical staff, survived the purge and has been in charge of the team’s training, as they prepare for an away encounter against ZPC Kariba at Nyamhunga Stadium on Saturday. Development side Bosso90 coach Melusi Sibanda has been assisting Luphahla. <img class="wp-image-611220 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Melusi Sibanda Highlanders are languishing in 12th place on the league table with 16 points and will be seeking to break a 28-game winless streak outside Bulawayo. Highlanders’ last win outside Bulawayo was a 1-0 win over Triangle United at Gibbo Stadium on July 22, 2018. This season Highlanders have played six matches outside Bulawayo and lost twice to Black Rhinos and Manica Diamonds and drawn three times. Their other away game against FC Platinum was abandoned with the score tied 1-1 following crowd trouble after the hosts had been awarded a penalty. Bosso now await a PSL determination, although indications show that FC Platinum will be awarded the match on a 3-0 score line, since it was Bosso fans that started the disturbances. With Mpofu gone, Highlanders will be hoping for a change in fortunes.  But Bosso should expect a tough game against a ZPC Kariba that is fighting for survival. Besides trying to end their winless run on the road, Highlanders are also battling for their first away victory against ZPC Kariba who were promoted into the PSL in 2014. Highlanders have played six away games against ZPC Kariba since 2014 and lost four times, and drawn twice. ZPC Kariba are now under the tutelage of former Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Rodwell Dhlakama, who will be in charge of his third assignment when they face Bosso. Dhlakama won 1-0 against Whawha at home in his first game in Kariba and lost 0-3 away to Bulawayo City. A victory for third from the bottom ZPC Kariba, who have 13 points, will take them level on points with Highlanders, making the encounter potentially explosive, as Bosso will want to avoid slipping into the relegation zone. At the National Sports Stadium on Sunday, Dynamos, who surprisingly suspended coach Tonderai Ndiraya and proffering no explanation, face midtable side Herentals. <img class="wp-image-520581 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Tonderai-Ndiraya.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Tonderai-Ndiraya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Tonderai-Ndiraya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tonderai Ndiraya DeMbare are second on the league table with 30 points, one behind leaders Chicken Inn. Ndiraya’s weekend suspension came as a shock considering that Dynamos have strongly positioned themselves in the title race. The Dynamos executive is expected to make a decision on Ndiraya today, but the move to suspend the coach could backfire and affect their title charge. Herentals are in eighth place with 22 points and are unpredictable as they shocked FC Platinum 1-0, held pacesetters Chicken Inn to a goalless draw in Bulawayo and drew 1-1 with Bulawayo Chiefs in their last three matches.
