The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter Namibia 127/8 20 overs (Williams 48, Madhevere 2/15, Jongwe 2/16, Raza 2/18) beat Zimbabwe 95 19.1 overs (Munyonga 28, Erasmus 2/9, Frylinck 2/25) by 32 runs ZIMBABWE suffered the embarrassment of being the first International Cricket Council Full Member to lose a Twenty20 International cricket series to Namibia when the determined Eagles overwhelmed the Chevrons by 32 runs in the fifth and final T20I played at Queens Sports Club yesterday to take the five-match contest 3-2. <img class="size-full wp-image-587251" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-25-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-25-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-25-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chevrons With all to play for as the series was tied at 2-2, it was a pedestrian approach from Zimbabwe, especially in their run chase, while the Namibians were more determined and hungrier to win it. Zimbabwe bowlers had done well to limit Namibia to 127/8 in 20 overs only for the batsmen to let the team down and be skittled out for 95 in 19.1 overs. Man of the match Craig Williams top scored for the Namibians with 48 runs off 39 deliveries, with the next best score coming from Ruben Trumpelmann with 19 from 14 balls.  Zimbabwe’s run chase never got going as soon as their star batsman Wessley Madhevere fell leg before wicket to Jan Frylinck for 10 runs. Tony Munyonga gave Zimbabwe some hope with 28 off 31 runs, but when he was bowled by David Wiese, all optimism evaporated for the home team and they were eventually wiped out in the last over. <img class="wp-image-611730 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-36.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-36.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-36-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> International Cricket Council (ICC) In the individual accolades, Bernard Scholtz took the bowler of the series, while batsman of the tournament went to Madhevere and Namibian captain Gerhard Erasmus took the player of the series accolade. Zimbabwe have to engage in some serious introspection as they gear up for more action early next month at home against Afghanistan. The Afghans are heading to Zimbabwe for three one-day internationals and five T20Is, all at Harare Sports Club. For the Namibian players and coaching staff, who include former South African pace bowler Morne Morkel, winning their first ever T20I series over an ICC Full Member meant a lot and they could be seen celebrating on the pitch, while their Zimbabwean counterparts cut forlorn figures as they trooped off the pitch. — @Mdawini_29
