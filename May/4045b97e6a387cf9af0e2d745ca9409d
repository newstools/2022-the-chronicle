Vumbachikwe Mine rescue team captain Mr Cleopas Karima said the rescue mission had been a difficult one. “We started pumping water on Sunday around 10PM because the mine had problems with broken pipes so we started by equipping the pipes and the pump. We continued pumping until Monday around 10PM, that’s when we started to see the first body floating on top of water. We continued pumping until today (Tuesday) around 5AM, that’s when we saw six bodies,” said Mr Karima. He said the team started cleaning the shaft and installing some working platforms to enable them to retrieve the bodies. – @Yolisswa
