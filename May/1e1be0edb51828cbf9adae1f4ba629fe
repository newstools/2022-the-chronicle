TOP Bulawayo-based boxing referee Steven Masiyambumbi will leave the country today to officiate in the Women’s Boxing Championships in Turkey. This will be the fourth time he officiates in an international tournament, placing the local boxing industry on the world map.  “I am excited to be officiating in a big competition like this one. Last year in October I was in Belgrade, Serbia, at the men’s competition. I have also officiated in two World Games competitions in China, and am happy to be getting such recognition. “This assures me that I am on the right track in terms of officiating. I pray one day I will be able to impart this knowledge to other officials and aspiring boxing referees in our country,” said Masiyambumbi. He holds a three-star referees’ and judge qualification, which is the highest in world boxing. Last year he was invited to attend a course in Dubai and excelled, resulting in him being nominated to officiate in the Men’s World Championships in Serbia. “I started the journey in 2014 after Zimbabwe hosted the African Union Sports Council Region 5 Games (in Bulawayo). I did my two-star course in Botswana and was crowned the best official in the zone. I have officiated in China, Serbia, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, Angola, Zambia, South Africa, Tanzania and now Turkey. My dream is to officiate in the Olympic Games. “I failed to qualify for the Olympics as a boxer, but it’s not the end of the road as I can still go there as a proud Zimbabwean Referee. This is the start of a journey and I will use the information I will gather and impart it to our boxers as a coach. It is good that I will represent the country on the world stage. Being a referee on the international arena means there will be some form of recognition for the country in the sport of boxing,” he said. — @innocentskizoe
