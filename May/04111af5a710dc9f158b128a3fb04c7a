NEXT generation financial services platform and one of the largest money transfer providers in Africa, Mukuru, have been announced as sleeve sponsors of English Premier League side Crystal Palace for the 2022/23 season. Mukuru was founded by Zimbabwean Rob Burrell. Mukuru chief executive officer Andy Jury said football is the most supported sport in Africa, united people globally and their customers identified Crystal Palace as one of the teams they support, hence the sleeve sponsorship deal. <img class="size-full wp-image-606207" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rob-Burrell.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rob-Burrell.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Rob-Burrell-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rob Burrell. He said the Premier League is home to a wide range of talented African players, who left their home countries to pursue their dreams, and this inspires the Mukuru customer to continue to pursue their dreams and fills them with the belief that their journey from their home country in pursuit of a better life can result in something beautiful. Palace is a team with several African players and an iconic coach with strong African heritage in Patrick Viera, who Mukuru customers look up to and resonate with. “We are excited to be associated with Crystal Palace, a well-respected and prestigious Premier League team. The sponsorship places Mukuru on an international stage, further entrenching our global presence, operating in over 50 countries around the world,” said Jury. <img class="size-full wp-image-606202" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andy-Jury.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andy-Jury.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Andy-Jury-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andy Jury “Mukuru is a business that puts the customer at the centre of everything we do. Our essence and passion lie in helping to solve problems for Africa’s emerging consumers through financial inclusion and uniting people across the world. This passion drives the way we do business, the way we communicate with our customers and the way we choose partnerships.” Palace commercial director Barry Webber said this is an exciting partnership for Crystal Palace, and they’re thrilled to welcome Mukuru on board.  “As a club, we are incredibly proud of our links with the African continent, which were encapsulated by midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate winning the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year. This partnership will help us to continue to expand our international fanbase, and Mukuru join us at a fantastically exciting time for the club, both on the pitch and off of it,” Webber said. Mukuru has also struck a naming rights deal with Malawi Super League side Mighty Wanderers.
