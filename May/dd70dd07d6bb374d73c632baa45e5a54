UNITED KINGDOM-based musician Sisa Senkosi is hoping to clinch her debut award at the Zim Achievers Awards 2022 edition. This is the artiste’s second nomination for the awards that seek to recognise Zimbabweans based in the diaspora for their outstanding and notable achievements. She was nominated last year in the Cultural Ambassador category but did not win, something she hopes will change this year. She is up against Tsungai Tsikirai, Ndebele Qho, Evans Marlo and Ivor Moyo.  Said Sisa Senkosi: “I’m honoured to be nominated for the second time. It’s been a difficult period as we’ve been through trying times with Covid-19. But as an artiste, I’ve not let this deter me as I’ve continued to push my brand and uplift my culture. “I’d totally love to bring the award home and wish my fellow nominees all the best. I’d also like to call on all my fans to keep voting. Le ngeyethu.” <img class="wp-image-606124 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-19-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-19-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-19-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tsungai Tsikirai The maskandi artiste said as a cultural ambassador, she sings in Ndebele and her costumes resonate with her culture. “I sing one of the oldest genres of music, maskandi. As a cultural ambassador, I sing in IsiNdebele and my costumes resonate with my culture. I perform to audiences that sometimes, do not understand our language and that on its own, shows how committed I am in making our culture known,” she said. “I also host a talk show on Facebook named Itshukelwa ebandla where current issues are discussed in isiNdebele. This is especially for those who are based in the Diaspora.” Turning to her music, Sisa Senkosi said her team is working on her programme for the year and assured people that she will be releasing more work during the course of the year.
