It also focuses on value addition to contributing significantly to food security and nutrition, import-substitution, foreign currency generation, employment creation and raising household incomes in pursuit of Vision 2030. The Rural Horticulture Transformation Plan is anchored on the Presidential Horticulture Scheme, which seeks to create and sustain a US$1,2 billion rural horticulture economy by 2025.  According to the concept paper for the meeting, horticulture presents an opportunity to increase food security, import substitution, enhance exports, increase employment creation, improve the livelihoods of the rural population and raise household incomes. “The Horticulture Recovery and Growth Plan is opportune and timely, especially as the Government re-engages the international community and seeks to create a  more market-based economy, integrated  into the global community,” said the organisers. Zimbabwe has been a major producer and exporter of a variety of horticultural crops driven by favourable climatic conditions, strong farming skills and access to favourable export markets. The export market destinations were Europe for cut flowers, fruits and vegetables. <img class="wp-image-612007 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-67-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-67-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-67-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> cut flowers  The sector used to be the fastest-growing after tobacco in foreign currency earnings.
