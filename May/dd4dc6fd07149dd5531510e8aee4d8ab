BULAWAYO Chiefs will be without head coach Nilton Terroso when they face Caps United in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Luveve Stadium tomorrow. Terroso is attending a coaching course in England. Speaking ahead of the tie, Chiefs assistant coach Thulani Sibanda said they are not reading into history going into the encounter. <img class="wp-image-612718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-41-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chiefs assistant coach Thulani Sibanda “We are not reading into the past. Yes, we can say that we have not beaten them before, but there is always a first time for everything and we will not take that into our minds. We have been preparing well and the boys are geared up to play their level best. Of course, we do have some concerns in terms of injuries, as Kelvin Madzongwe is still not back. Mthokozisi Msebe is back, but is not fit for this one. <img class="wp-image-612727 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mthokozisi Msebe We strongly believe that the guys can do the job. “Playing Caps United is always a tough encounter. They are a seasoned team with a seasoned coach and they have seasoned players so it’s a game that can go either way. We can’t relax and say the last two to three weeks they have been lacking so it’s going to be easy, no, it’s not going to be easy,” said Sibanda.  Two points separate the two sides, with Chiefs sitting in ninth place on the league table with 19 points and Caps United in 11th place on 17 points. Caps United have lost their last four matches and last recorded a win on April 4 when they edged Yadah 1-0. Sunday’s game will be Caps United’s third since a player mutiny that resulted in a 0-2 loss to Cranborne Bullets. – @innocentskizoe
