Heart said the drama series explores romantic relationships. “Soulmate is a Zimbabwean, young adult drama series that explores concepts and themes associated with young adults. The series is about two lovers, Phumza and Locratia, who will take viewers on a journey that will reveal how they ended up becoming soulmates.  “Amid their respective narrations, viewers will come face-to -face with the romantic man that Phumza is and how his wandering eye leads to ups and downs in his relationship with the beautiful Locratia,” Heart said. “The series uses a flash-forward that involves a mystery element with most episodes taking placing in three timelines.” He said it was pleasing that their business relationship with ZTN is a blossoming one that will certainly revive the country’s film industry. “We had a meeting with ZTN and they fell in love with the production. It felt like it was meant to be, you know, just like soulmates. <img class="alignnone wp-image-595739 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/FILM.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/FILM.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/FILM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We’re confident that this relationship is the start of more great things to come as we move to put the country’s film industry on an international platform,” said Heart.
