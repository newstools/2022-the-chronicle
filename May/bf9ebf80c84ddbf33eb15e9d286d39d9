The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Health reporter JOURNALISTS have been urged to remain diligent in writing more comprehensive Covid-19 stories in the wake of an infodemic which has affected the uptake of vaccines. <img class="wp-image-568514 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Covid-vaccine.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Covid-vaccine.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Covid-vaccine-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid vaccine Mr Thandolwenkosi Nkomo, a media mentor from Internews – a non profit  that promotes access to information, yesterday told journalists at a Covid-19 media seminar in Bulawayo that coverage has reduced compared to the time the disease first broke out in Zimbabwe. He said journalists had a role to play in addressing trending myths and misconceptions which have affected the uptake of the vaccines in Zimbabwe. The World Health Organization defines an infodemic as too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak. <img class="wp-image-607789 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The World Health Organization An infodemic can intensify or lengthen outbreaks when people are unsure about what they need to do to protect their health and the health of people around them. With growing digitisation – an expansion of social media and internet use – information can spread more rapidly. This can help to more quickly fill information voids but can also amplify harmful messages as with Covid-19. Mr Nkomo said his organisation had analysed about 24 myths and misconceptions making rounds which have tampered with public health interventions. “Covid-19 is still causing havoc but sadly we have seen a drop in the number of stories on Covid-19 over the past months. <img class="alignnone wp-image-579668 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/covid-19-omnicon.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/covid-19-omnicon.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/covid-19-omnicon-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We have some media houses that haven’t carried a single story for months yet we still haven’t won the battle. “The few who are still consistent are not doing justice considering that we have a lot of myths circulating which people believe,” said Mr Nkomo. “For us to achieve herd immunity we need more comprehensive stories from our media houses, stories with human faces with headlines that focus on giving a holistic view of the Covid-19 situation, so people make rational decisions that are not based on fear. Reporters should also Avoid the use of alarmist or exaggerated headlines as these may lead people to ignore Covid-19 related stories and therefore miss information that can save their lives.”   The demand for news and information has led to unprecedented spread of fake news, rumors, myths and misinformation about Covid-19 especially on social media, said Mr Nkomo. “We therefore need journalists to cover and continuously inform members of the public so that people get much information from the media to be able to make informed choices that will benefit them.” –@thamamoe
