MATOBO based farmer Ms Nurse Malaba grabbed the attention of many at the recently held First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa’s Matabeleland South Provincial Traditional Cook-Out with her finger millet beverage which she said neutralises sexual drive among children. Ms Malaba, who came second in the competition, said the drink has been tried and tested. She believes in the power of organic solutions to cure ailments, strengthen the body and ensure maximised production in farming. Her famous beverage, which she said is very popular in her area, caught the attention of many with most people requesting the recipe. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611049 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Malaba also had baobab juice which she said can fight high blood pressure and mental illness. She said children were becoming sexually active at an early stage because of the processed food they were eating. “I have a drink which is made from finger millet which can help to tone down sexual desire among young children. Children of today are becoming sexually active as early as the age of 10. The finger millet drink can help to tone this down. I have given my grandchildren and it has worked. I have even sold it to my neighbours and they have confirmed that it works,” she said. “I take water and mix it with finger millet and allow to soak at night. I give the teenager a tablespoon in the morning and evening for five days. It can be given to both boys and girls. A child can be given the course after three months.” She said she also produces small grains which she packs into small packages and sells to the community. She operates under the name Imvelo Products which emphasises that her products are organic. Ms Malaba said she uses organic manure to ensure that her crops perform well. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611049 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She also has a road runner project and to ensure that her chickens do well, she feeds them organic food. Ms Malaba also produces organic peanut butter. Organic farming is a form of agriculture that relies on crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control. An organic farmer will still use fertilisers and pesticides, but strictly limits or excludes the use of synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides.  “I practice organic farming at my homestead. I received training on organic farming under Dabane Trust. I produce small grains the traditional way and I use manure that comes from my kraals. I process the manure myself. I collect it from the kraal and place it under a shade as the sun will cause it to lose nutrients,” she said. Ms Malaba added: “I process my manure for two to three weeks. I use a stick to check whether its ready. I insert a stick into the manure and if it comes out warm I know that my manure isn’t ready yet. If the sticks comes out cold then I know the manure is ready. Manure that is not properly processed can burn the crops. I also have road runners and I feed them calcium, fat and protein to ensure they grow well.” <img class="wp-image-611052 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-37-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-37-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-37-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Organic food She said she also takes climate change into consideration. Ms Malaba said she has adopted farming methods and selects crops that are relevant to the prevailing climatic conditions. This helps her to maximise her production and ensure her crops are of good quality. Organic farming, she said, also requires one to adopt conservation methods of farming to preserve soil and get the most from its nutrients. Ms Malaba said she uses contours and water sheds to trap water. “Organic products are important as they don’t harm the body compared to synthetic products. Today many people are suffering from diseases like high blood pressure, sugar diabetes, heart failure because of synthetic ways of preparing food and growing crops as well as consumption of inorganic food,” Ms Malaba said. She said some of the synthetic fertilisers that were being used in farming flow into dams and pollute water thereby affecting livestock that drink the water and fish.  – @DubeMatutu
