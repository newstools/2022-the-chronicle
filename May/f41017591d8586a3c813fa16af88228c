SPRING Hub Publishing company has introduced innovative primary school textbooks linked to the technology of the day, proving relevant to the new competence-based curriculum of the country. The publishing company publishes books that contain QR codes linked to an app making it possible for a learner to get simpler explanations of certain topics in video format, more like YouTube tutorials.  The publishing company has managed to take advantage of a bilateral trade agreement between Zimbabwe and India. It is working hand in hand with an Indian company to develop Nytra Zim for the Zimbabwe education system.
Spring Hub Publishing company, taking advantage of technology based on augmented reality exhibited at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) last week and scooped a Silver Award for best first-time exhibitor. In an interview, Spring hub publishing Managing Director, Ms Nyunyayi Machiwenyika said once one buys their textbooks, they first download a mobile app called Nytra Zim from Google PlayStore or App Store for free and follow the steps to register. <img class="wp-image-605539 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-21-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-21-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-21-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nytra Zim “Once that is done, you can scan any QR code in any one of the Spring Hub Publishing textbooks and you can watch it come alive on your smart gadget. NytraZim allows one to view 3D digital content that is embedded in a hard copy textbook,” she said. Ms Machiwenyika said Nytra Zim is based on augmented reality as it makes understanding of abstract concepts better. “This therefore inadvertently results in better comprehension and better recall. It also encourages imagination, creativity and engagement in class making learning fun for the pupils and teaching more fulfilling for the teacher,” she said. Ms Machiwenyika said the publications and applications are the first of that kind in Zimbabwe which adds flavour to their uniqueness. She said there is no way a child can be exposed to undesirable content while using the platform. She said one needs three things to access Nytra Zim anywhere and anytime, a Spring Hub Textbook, a smart gadget and data connectivity. “It is based on augmented reality which is unique in terms of the digital content available in the market. It is tailor-made to the exact requirements of the new competence-based syllabus of Zimbabwe and that again makes it unique. <img class="size-full wp-image-603136" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-7-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-7-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-7-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe International Trade Fair It is also a low cost set up. One only needs a smart gadget, internet connectivity and a Spring Up Textbook for them to access. “Nytra Zim digital content is made to the requirements of our local school curriculum and is evaluated by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education Curriculum Development Uni, therefore there are zero chances of exposure to undesirable content for our pupils if one is using this platform,” she said. Ms Machiwenyika said Zimbabwe is not exempted from the gap that every country is grappling with today, even the advanced economies of the world, that of the integration of technologies into the education sector. “Technology has advanced so much and the education sector has a lot of catching up to do. Spring Hub Publishing is ready to pioneer this journey in Zimbabwe and Nytra Zim is just one technology we intend to introduce. We are busy working on other forms of technology that we feel are applicable in our country and will give our pupils the right exposure as they prepare to go out into the highly technological work space that is unfolding,” she said. <img class="wp-image-601795 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Technology – Image taken from Shutterstock She said as an organisation they have been visiting schools around the country, advertising their books and platform. She said some of the schools have shown appreciation of the technology and they are starting to use the app. “The community will also appreciate this product as it is safe to use, has a cheap set up cost, the videos are optimised for minimal data usage, it allows remote learning anywhere, anytime — it also allows for independent learning as a pupil can get on with their learning in the absence of a teacher. The benefits of Nytra Zim are endless to the pupil, the teacher, the parents and to the country at large. <img class="size-full wp-image-605542" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-22-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Spring Hub Publishing Embracing technology in class is the way to go if we are to be future fit as a nation — as long as the community is forward looking, they have no choice but to embrace extensive use of technologies in class. Our duty is to make sure the technology is appropriate, applicable and user friendly,” said Ms Machiwenyika. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-579687" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/books-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/books-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/books-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She said they currently have content for primary school pupils only. She said as they develop hard copy textbooks for secondary and high school, they will continue with digital content development for these levels too, so that every learner who has a Spring Hub textbook automatically has access to technology. “We are truly humbled by that recognition and we appreciate the whole Spring Hub Publishing for daring to charter new grounds and doing it in style,” said Ms Machiwenyika.
