The Chronicle Psalms 23:6
“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life…” (KJV) When you have the blessing of God upon your life, no demon or evil power will be able to stop God’s plan for you, they will all bow down. Your generational curses are turned into future contagious blessings that you perpetuate to your children. Even those who knew you before will see the breakthroughs in your life, family, faith, finances and wonder what really happened to you. Your life will be rescued from the tormentor and will stay under the sweet refuge and dwelling of your mentor Jesus Christ.  Your life will move forward and you will be surpassed by His peace. Great productivity, results and success will follow you. God’s blessing is so powerful that it makes you move much faster than those who were ahead of you. Your spiritual and natural geographical position will be completely revolutionised. It does not matter if you are in a tough and oppressed geographical position, it will change and be affected by the covenant blessing of the Lord upon your life. The blessing of God moves a person from glory to glory. If you see your life moving up and down like a yo-yo, be assured, it is not God. God moves you up only and not up and down. Your November with God becomes better than your August. You can become in five minutes, what has taken others five years. Whereas they knew you as nothing but suddenly you will become someone meaningful. He will make all things possible with you. God will make people in authority move on your behalf. <img class="size-full wp-image-603235" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: Shutterstock Proverbs 10:22
The blessing of the LORD makes one rich, And He adds no sorrow with it. (NKJV) The NIV version says, “The blessing of the Lord brings wealth without painful toil for it.” This teaches us that if we have the blessing we do not have to toil. This scripture also tells us that when He blesses you, the blessing fastens itself to your life and nothing will later return to harm you. The blessing sticks with you and cannot be reversed by the enemy. 3 John 1:2
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. (NKJV) God Bless… eaglelifeassembly@yahoo.com
