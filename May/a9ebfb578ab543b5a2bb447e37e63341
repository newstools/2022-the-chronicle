Romano Tweeted: “Sadio Mane has decided to leave Liverpool this summer. He’s ready for a new experience after many special years with Reds – it will be confirmed to the club. FC Bayern are strong contenders, but it’s still open and not completed as Sadio wanted to wait for the final.” Klopp was quizzed about Mane’s future before the loss to Real Madrid and he failed to give much away. He said: “Sadio is in the shape of his life, a joy to watch in training and in games. We ask a lot of him. He has had an incredibly long season, a lot of finals, and it has been so far one of the most successful seasons for him.  Wherever Sadio will play next season he will be a big player. Definitely.” Mane has been one of the most influential figures in Liverpool’s success in recent years, scoring 120 goals and providing 48 assists in 269 appearances since joining from Southampton for £34 million in 2016. – Daily Mail
