BULAWAYO Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube says sport and recreation help women learn various virtues of ‘ubuntu’ which extend to dignity, trust, sharing, unselfishness caring and respect.  Speaking at the Women in Sport Day Celebrations held at Sizinda Vocational Training Centre on Saturday, Minister Ncube said it was unfortunate that 2020 and 2021 were Covid-19 hit years which forced them not to celebrate women. “This year’s National Women and Girls’ Festival is running under the theme ‘#break the bias’. It is even more pleasing to note that we are not only gathered here to get fit and healthier, but to socialise through various sporting activities taking place today. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-591895" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/stop-to-drug-and-substance-abuse.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/stop-to-drug-and-substance-abuse.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/stop-to-drug-and-substance-abuse-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We are gathered here to celebrate the importance of women, which reverberates to a valued community. Family values are supposedly learned by children from within a traditional family unit anchored by a dignified woman,” Minister Ncube said. She also called for increased participation of women in sport and said Saturday’s event resonates with Government’s Community Sport and Recreation Club system. “The Community Sport and Recreation Club system stimulates mass participation in sport and recreation by all people, including women, persons with disability and the elderly, to address issues of discipline, healthy lifestyles, community development, social cohesion and culture thereby contributing to the betterment of our nation to see Zimbabwe becoming a middle-income economy by 2030,” she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-607038" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Person with disability The Minister pleaded with youths to desist from drug abuse, saying the negative effects of drug abuse cannot be overemphasised. “It is my fervent hope that sporting initiatives such as this one will take youths away from grasps of despair and miserable life in the streets to heights of ecstasy accompanied by fruitful enjoyment of sport benefits, which include, but not limited to better quality of life,” said Minister Ncube. — @innocentskizoe
