The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent THE Midlands Province has been reporting a worrying increase in women who die while giving birth, a situation attributed to lack of resources, long distances travelled to access health facilities and shortage of health workers. Provincial Medical Director, Dr Marry Muchekeza confirmed the increase in maternal deaths. <img class="alignnone wp-image-607348 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Muchekeza said maternal deaths increased from 79 deaths per 100 000 births in 2018 to about 130 deaths per every 100 000 births in 2021. “According to the statistics reported through our information system, the province has been reporting a worrying increase in maternal deaths and efforts are being made to address the problem in line with global targets. These figures are unacceptably high and we are doing all within our power to stop this trend,” said Dr Muchekeza. Shortage of equipment at most health facilities is the main cause, according to Dr Muchekeza. <img class="alignnone wp-image-607350 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-8-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The province has 256 health facilities but only 15 have comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care which enables safe delivery for pregnant women. Dr Muchekeza said according to 2022 population estimates, the province has about 346 287 women of child bearing age and expects about 69 260 deliveries this year. She said the shortage of equipment was being compounded by shortage of staff. “Some of our gains are being eroded by the exodus of skilled manpower like midwives and doctors as this affects the quality of service. Since 2019 we have lost 128 midwives who have left to seek greener pastures abroad,” she said. Dr Muchekeza said some hospitals have been forced to suspend surgical procedures due to both shortage of equipment and staff. <img class="alignnone wp-image-607357 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-10-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-10-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-10-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Silobela District Hospital in Kwekwe district, Musume and Masase Mission Hospital in Mberengwa are some of the health institutions that have been forced to suspend surgical services.  Dr Muchekeza said pregnant women in districts such as Gokwe North, Gokwe South, Mberengwa, Zhombe and Silobela are travelling long distances to access health services.
