The sports gala is used to identify talent within correctional services. Guest of honour Commissioner Moddie Nkomo said the event seeks to promote teamwork among participants and improve their self-esteem and self-discipline. “The event is meant to achieve team goals and encourage professionalism. The event has also created career development opportunities for best performing participants as we had sports personnel from topflight sporting disciplines such as football and netball. <img class="alignnone wp-image-542390 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/darts.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/darts.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/darts-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> l believe they were impressed with the talent exhibited by athletes from different sporting disciplines,” said Comm Nkomo. “Sport services have proven to be a vehicle to unite our officers as well as promoting their physical, mental and social well-being. It has also proven to be a tonic in easing stress in our key stakeholders; the inmates. “It is important to note that the school considers this sporting event as a vital aspect of training as it does not only offer recreation, but reinforces teamwork among participants. It is our belief that a physically fit correctional services officer is likely to be mentally stable to perform his or her duties diligently thereby propelling the organisation towards achieving its constitutional mandate,” Comm Nkomo said. Assistant Commissioner Somemore Gate of Ntabazinduna Training School said: “The school relocated to this place from Harare in 1999. The sporting gala, which is now in its sixth edition, raises awareness on the promotion of sports, drawing attention to communities to take action to partner ZPCS in its initiatives of protection of society, which is a constitutional mandate.” — @innocentskizoe
