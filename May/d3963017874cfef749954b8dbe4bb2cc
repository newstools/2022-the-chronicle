TRADITIONAL leaders have said drug and substance abuse which is most prevalent among youths is stalling development within communities as the youngsters are supposed to be pushing development agendas. In a bid to address issues of drug and substance abuse which are rampant throughout the country, President Mnangagwa recently appointed an inter-ministerial taskforce committee chaired by the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare.  The duty of the taskforce is to co-ordinate all drugs and substance abuse interventions across the country. The same structures have been replicated at provincial level. A National Drug Abuse Fund has been set aside to help fight the drug abuse scourge. The fund which is provided in this year’s budget is meant to, among other things, establish rehabilitation centres for drug addicts and also help combat drug and substance abuse. Zimbabwe is working towards a drug free society through a drug master plan which will help the country achieve Vision 2030. The Zimbabwe National Drug Master Plan (2020- 2025) offers an integrated and comprehensive approach that will address a range of drug related issues. Schools and tertiary institutions have been identified as some of the hotspots when it comes to drug abuse. Drug and substance abuse is rampant throughout the country, even in rural areas. In an interview, Chief Bango from Mangwe District said community development projects require the input of both the elderly and the youth in order for them to be successful. “Some of the youth are now pre-occupied with drugs and alcohol and are not taking an active role in developmental projects within the community. Youths are there within the community but a few pitch up to assist in projects,” he said. “Development projects need the elderly and youths to work together in order to be successful. The youth have the energy needed for manual work and the brains to come up with innovative solutions while the elderly have the wisdom and experience.” He said some projects were collapsing as they were being spearheaded by the elderly who no longer have energy. Chief Bango said some projects like irrigation schemes and nutritional gardens could perform even better if they had more youths involved. Chief Sitaudze in Beitbridge District said drug and substance abuse was robbing the nation of its knowledge base. He said the future of many youngsters had been destroyed because drug and substance abuse. Chief Sitaudze said some of young people need professional help such as rehabilitation centres but such facilities were not available in rural areas. <img class="size-full wp-image-592690" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Masendu “Some of our youngsters are now living under the full influence of drugs and they have lost direction. They are now incapable of focusing and doing anything progressive. The future of youngsters is being affected because of these drugs. Some of them are intelligent and have the potential of attaining greater heights but they have been imprisoned by drugs,” he said. “Some of these youngsters need rehabilitation so that they can get professional help and recover from their situations.” Chief Masendu from Bulilima District said efforts being done by Government to address drug and substance abuse especially among the youth were commendable. He said there was need for intervention even in remote parts of the country. Chief Masendu said drug and substance abuse was robbing the country of its future generation. — @DubeMatutu
