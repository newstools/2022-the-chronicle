One of the main supporting acts for Everton Mlalazi’s Homecoming Gospel concert that is slated for the ZITF on Saturday, Mkhululi Bhebhe says he cannot wait to take to the stage in Bulawayo, “the place where it all began”. The show, expected to be one of the biggest gospel shows in Bulawayo in a while, will double up as Mlalazi’s birthday celebration.
Bhebhe, whose gospel profile needs no introduction will be coming down to the city from South Africa with another popular gospel artiste, Takesure Zamar Ncube, for the gospel concert. <img class="size-full wp-image-606831" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZITF “It brings me so much joy to be making my way back to where it all began over a decade and a half ago. Things are coming full circle for me and I’m excited. Having travelled to so many countries by God’s grace, I’ve longed to share a moment with my own people. And for this moment to come after almost two years of lockdown makes it even sweeter,” said Bhebhe. He said people should come prepared to worship. “All I encourage people to do is to come with an open heart. Yes, we shall be celebrating my brother Everton Mlalazi’s birthday, but somebody’s situation needs to change for the better at the end of the day. Bathi ukuhlabela kuyathokozisa odabukileyo, hlabelela,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-610027" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-36-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Takesure Zamar Ncube Bhebhe said his ministry “brings joy into the hearts of the people” judging by the many testimonies he has received regarding his musical gift.
