The newly-elected councillor for Ward 6 Bekithemba Mlotshwa bankrolls VIP Mosi and businessman Christopher Ndiweni donated money to the youthful Mosi Queens who finished second.  Ndiweni said he donated to VIP Queens because the team is made up of schoolgirls who could promote the growth of netball in Victoria Falls. VIP Mosi won the tournament. Mosi Queens coach Gugulethu Ndlovu said she was excited by her youthful team’s performance and thanked Ndiweni for pledging to finance some of her players’ academic studies.

Talent can also be identified from such tournaments and we can have children playing for bigger clubs or even the national team “ he said. Dlamini said there is a future in sport and this can also promote sport tourism. “We also want to promote sport tourism because we can’t continue relying on traditional tourism such as game watching and visiting the waterfalls,” Dlamini said. – @ncubeleon.
