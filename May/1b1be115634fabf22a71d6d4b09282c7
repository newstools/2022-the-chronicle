GOVERNMENT is set to introduce electricity transformers with secret markings, to curb infrastructure theft in the country. Zesa transformers would be easy to identify as it is suspected the utility may be buying it’s own stolen transformers that would have been refurbished by unscrupulous dealers.  This was revealed by the Deputy Minister of Energy and Power Development Magna Mudyiwa in the senate last week. The initiative comes at a time when there have been increased cases of transformer and copper cable theft as well as vandalism in most parts of Zimbabwe which have seen residents going without electricity until, in some cases, they use their own money to replace the equipment. <img class="size-full wp-image-609523" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/COPPER.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/COPPER.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/COPPER-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Copper cables Deputy Minister Mudyiwa said having secret markings will help during the crucial inspection when Zesa is buying the transformers from any companies or distributors. “Transformers will have secret markings so that they can be identified in cases where there will be thefts that have taken place. When those transformers are sold to Zesa, Zesa will inspect and check for those secret markings. If it is discovered, that will become a case to the people selling,” she said. According to the standing policy, Zesa clients who buy electricity cables or transformers are entitled to full compensation and the reimbursement is in the form of electricity units equivalent to the cost of equipment a client would have bought. <img class="wp-image-609532 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/TRANSFORMERS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/TRANSFORMERS.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/TRANSFORMERS-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A transformer Responding to a question tabled by Senator Chief Chikwakwa (Witness Bungu), deputy minister Mudyiwa said even if people buy the transformers using their own money, as long as Zesa installs them they become their property. “If people come together and buy a transformer, they are given specifications by Zesa and Zesa officials inspect the transformer and also install it. So, if it has been installed by Zesa then automatically it becomes the property of Zesa and they are the ones who are supposed to maintain or replace it after it has been vandalised,” she said. The deputy minister challenged the public to work with Zesa in guarding transformers from theft and vandalism.
She said members of the public can come up with groups such as neighbourhood watch groups who will protect transformers from vandalism.
