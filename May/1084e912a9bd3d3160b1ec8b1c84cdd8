The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau ZANU-PF Second Secretary Cde Kembo Mohadi has said Government and its partners should always involve traditional leaders when rolling out key infrastructure and community development projects to ensure they move together with the people with a shared vision. He was speaking during an interview in Beitbridge on Tuesday, where he met the party’s District Coordinating Committee (DCC) and traditional leaders. Cde Mohadi said the Second Republic is implementing a number of infrastructure development programmes countrywide, whose success hinges on Zimbabweans working together. <img class="size-full wp-image-611841" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-49.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-49.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-49-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe He said Government had made great strides towards achieving that feat in line with Vision 2030 that seeks to make Zimbabwe an upper-middle-class economy by then. “You will note that traditional leaders are the custodians of the people and they need to be there when we are talking development matters,” said Cde Mohadi. “They have to be taken on board from the onset because they are the people that can drive the engine of development. <img class="size-full wp-image-612009" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-69-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> So far, as a  Zanu-PF government, we have covered a lot of ground on infrastructure development countrywide and in Matabeleland South we are building dams and rebuilding irrigation schemes”. He said irrigation development was a very critical catalyst for alleviating the effects of recurrent droughts. After completing dams and agriculture-related infrastructure, Cde Mohadi said the focus will be on the construction of more modern roads. He said good roads would help improve the food supply value chain and create linkages between the farmers and the markets for agricultural produce. “Droughts have been affecting us periodically and we have said to ourselves, let’s start with infrastructure development,” said Cde  Mohadi. “To start with, we thought of the building of dams and harnessing water from rivers and other water bodies for amplified smart agriculture irrigation development.  We have completed constructing a number of dams, while others are still under construction”. Cde Mohadi said soon more telecommunications boosters will be constructed in areas where there are deficiencies to ensure that there is a total communication signal coverage nationwide. He said the ongoing interactions with the Zanu-PF DCCS were aimed at creating synergies with all sections of the revolutionary party. “For you to understand people better, you need to be among the people and get what they need to proffer solutions on the dot. When you are implementing policies on the ground and you cannot then avoid getting feedback from the people,” said Vice President Mohadi. He said so far there has been a good  turnout at most of the meetings held in Insiza, Mangwe, Matobo, Plumtree, and Beitbridge districts. More meetings, he added, will be held continually across the country to ensure that everyone is reading from the same page where Zanu-PF matters are concerned. — @tupeyo
