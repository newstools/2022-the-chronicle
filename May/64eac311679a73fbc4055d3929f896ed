The Chronicle Thomas Sibanda, Historian FOLLOWING the death of Chief Mabhikwa, Chronicle sought the views of historian Mr Thomas Sibanda, who helped shed more light on the historical background of the chieftaincy. He shares his views below: The Mabhikwa chieftaincy is found in Lupane but it originated from Bubi District. <img class="wp-image-611278 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-12-copy-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-12-copy-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-12-copy-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> King Lobengula This particular chieftaincy was not originally under King Lobengula but was created after the collapse of the Ndebele State. What happened is that Queen Lozikeyi was allocated land by the whites in what is now known as koNkosikazi to reside with other queens after the disappearance of the King. The area did not have a chief. So, Queen Lozikeyi decided to appoint one of the Khumalos to become the chief for the area. She then chose Mfulane Khumalo to be the chief but he unfortunately did not have any boy child so he did not get any successor. <img class="size-full wp-image-611412" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Old Bulawayo getting roofed  This led to the selection of Mlonyeni who had a boy child with his second wife, MaThusi. She was from the Thusi clan  and they christened the child Mabhikwa Khumalo. <img class="wp-image-507241 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Queen-Lozikeyi-Dlodlo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Queen-Lozikeyi-Dlodlo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Queen-Lozikeyi-Dlodlo-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Queen Lozikeyi He was given Mabhikwa name because MaThusi had challenges conceiving. She was assisted to conceive by a Kalanga traditional healer called Mabhikwa. So, by tradition a child conceived as a result of interventions from a traditional healer is given the name of the traditional healer. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611415" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mlonyeni’s children with his first wife all died resulting in Mabhikwa being appointed the chief. That is how the Mabhikwa chieftaincy was conceived and the whites then relocated the Mabhikwa chieftaincy to Lupane. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611418" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/rr-copy-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This is how the Mabhikwa people were later to be found in Lupane but they are originally the Khumalos who came from Bubi District installed by Queen Lozikeyi.  It’s a very unique chieftaincy because they do not have a direct link with the rulership of King Lobengula. It was created by Queen Lozikeyi. That is how the chieftainship has carried on until this incident where we have lost this Chief Mabhikwa who has died in this painful manner.
