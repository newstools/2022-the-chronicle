SEVENTEEN local shows and one show across the Limpopo River in a space of a month is a movement that urban grooves maestro Nox Guni and his brother Tyfah are set to undertake this month. Dubbed the “Zaka Prince Nox and Tyfah Zim tour,” Bindura is set to play host to the first gig that is scheduled for tonight at Kangara Arcadia Dam. On May 20, the brothers will head to their home area in Masvingo where they will entertain fans at Liquids Club before they travel to Bulawayo the next day where they will perform at Parkview Pub and Grill. In Bulawayo, they will be supported by DJ Mzoe, DJ Molfy and DJ Rhaftoe. Harare will host the tour on May 22 before the tour is put on a five-day pause as the artistes will fly back to Rustenburg for a show there on May 27. <img class="size-full wp-image-579053" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/nox.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/nox.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/nox-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nox On May 28, the tour resumes in Beitbridge at Skeem Beit Club before Jongwe Corner in Chinhoyi hosts it the next day. Other gigs include Chegutu (June 3), Chiredzi (June 4), Harare (June 5, 10, 18 and 19), Chitungwiza (June 11), Gweru (June 24) and Kwekwe at Golden Mile (June 25). Two dates, June 17 and 25 have been shelved for shows and venues have yet to be announced. Nox will then embark on a world tour from July that will see him return to the UK then perform in the United States of America, Canada, Dubai, China, Australia, and New Zealand. He will wrap up the international tour in Caribbean Islands where he will also take time to shoot videos for his upcoming album titled Royal Alliances due to be released on September 10. Speaking to Chronicle Showbiz as he arrived in Zimbabwe earlier this week, Nox said through the historic tour, he wants to show the viability of local acts. “I need to change the mindset of our people as they need to believe in local artistes. For a long time, as Zimbabweans, we’ve been respecting foreign talent and looking down upon our own. I don’t know why. Money should circulate in our country and this can be done by supporting our own and people don’t seem to appreciate that. “Promoters need to understand that we need to be proud of our heritage because everything Zimbabwe is lekker. So, the ball is in our hands as artistes to showcase that. I’ve taken my step through these local shows. The 18 shows are a start of a movement that I wish will go very far. I’m hoping that people will embrace the shows so that we express our oneness as Zimbabweans,” said Nox. He said he has roped in local acts to support him on his quest. <img class="size-full wp-image-522927" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Tyfah.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Tyfah.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Tyfah-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tyfah Guni “Most of the artistes that will be supporting us are local, just to show the solidarity we have and how unity can help push an ideology or a movement.” The My Melody hit-maker said he decided to launch this tour as a way of connecting with local fans who rarely see him performing live on stage as he is based in South Africa. The Covid-19 pandemic that led to a halt of live shows also made it hard for Nox to physically connect with fans. “The Zimbabwe tour was inspired by the need to connect with my people. I want to avoid situations where I make a lot of hits in South Africa and become a household name there yet my people don’t really know me. “People should expect to see a superstar and A-class performances from me and my brother. And when I make it in South Africa, people will know that it’s a win for every Zimbabwean,” he said. Through the tour, Nox said brand Nox will try and change the narrative of the entertainment industry. “With this tour, we also want to educate people on how this industry is being run on an international level. I want to engage stakeholders in the industry and will use this platform.” On sharing the stage with Tyfah, a fast-rising artiste, Nox said: “Sharing the stage with Tyfah is a dream come true. I don’t think a lot of people know him and they are missing out as he’s coming up well. I feel this is an opportunity for him to blow up in his own country as he’s growing in South Africa. “We also have Ms Dee who we’ll be coming with a rare talent on its own also.” From their planning, Nox said they are targeting to attract at least 300 people per show, as they have considered the state of the economy. Turning to his career, he said more great works are set to come from his brand. “We have a big project that we’re working on. There’s a lot that we’re doing so that we add value to the sector and change the narrative. We’re also organising a world tour so that the music can grow with the brand as I believe that the brand is now bigger than the music,” said Nox. Nox, who was part of the urban grooves revolution in which other artistes such as Maskiri rose to prominence in the 90s, is an artiste who has managed to stay afloat through reinventing himself. The singer from Zaka, Masvingo province, released his first album titled Wandipengesa in 2004. Ever since then, the Ndinonyara hit-maker has grown from strength to strength and is now a sought-after artiste following his recent collaborations with Master KG and DJ Tira. He has six studio albums to his name and plenty of singles.  Tyfah who, for a long time, has been the resident producer at Nox’s Ice n Roses Records, producing hit after hit including Nox’s Uchandifunga, Letter to the President by Calaz, Kutsotsonya by Shinso and Bata Ruoko Rwangu by Freeman, is one artiste whom people need to pay attention to. Like Nox, he is committed to putting the country’s music out there if his actions are anything to go by. He introduced himself to people two years ago when he performed on the famed music platform — Channel O. Accompanied by Nox, the two performed live on the channel alongside Jerusalema hit-maker Master KG. The performance was to launch their collaborative Afro-soul house track titled Kure Kure. Tyfah is, however, not new to music but is a person who reinvented himself with his recent Afrocentric sound. Back in 2011, he, like his brother, was focused on the urban grooves sound. Tyfah is known by some for the single Dollar Dollar which made waves in the diaspora. His single titled Kunamata Chete and his old-time favourite, traditional song Ngaitaure, were also hits. “I started with urban grooves and then started leaning to Afro-pop. Right now, I can say my sound is Afrocentric. I’ve also started tapping into soulful house and have managed to do a collaboration with one of South Africa’s renowned artistes, Master KG,” Tyfah said while rallying people to support their nationwide tour.
