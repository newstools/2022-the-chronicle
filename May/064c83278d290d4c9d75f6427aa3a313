Ms Nleya (50) has been into business for the past 20 years as a small player and later established the Spa Center hair saloon and Kamandazi restaurant, also in the city. In an interview The Grand Arcade operations manager, Mr Henry Taguma, said Ms Nleya has spotted opportunity in Bulawayo as her prime business growth destination hence the opening of the new supermarket and expansion into the hospitality sector.  “Ms Nleya has been into business for the past 20 years and in her growth strategy she thought of owning a supermarket and extend from owning just a restaurant to owning an executive restaurant with a conference room inside,” said Mr Taguma. He would not be drawn to disclose the amount invested into the new business venture but said their operations were meant to offer a unique client experience. “We know that there are many restaurants in town but this one is customer centric considering that everything we did from the designs and everything was done from customers’ perspectives,” said Mr Taguma. He said their conference facility has already attracted bookings for the rest of the year from different
clients. “To make sure that we manage to give good customer service, we employ people who go through a series of training so as to give professional services,” said Mr Taguma. “Now we are working with about 20 workers who are trained for service.” He said their supermarket business was there to offer unique groceries and bakery adding that so far since their opening the market was responding positively. – @SikhulekelaniM1
