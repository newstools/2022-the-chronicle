A Bulawayo-based mental health practitioner Witness Mguni has opened his doors to artistes who may need free mental health support services following the realisation that artistes are going through depression and failing to get help as most cannot afford medical consultations. Apart from his medical health profession, Mguni has been in the arts industry long enough to notice that there is a need to address mental health issues among artistes as he manages renowned imbube group Amaqaqa. In an interview at his offices at the Bulawayo Centre’s first floor (WOTA Consultancy) yesterday, Mguni said he has noted that many artistes venture into the industry without fully understanding the demands and challenges that come with being an artiste.  And when things do not go their way, it becomes hard for them to cope. “Many people think that being an artiste is all about being famous, but it’s all about being a perfectionist and being able to put out a show that sells. “Artistes put in a lot of work and their craft becomes an 8am to 5pm job and all they wish for is to produce something that’ll benefit them financially. “But it’s not every show or every album that makes it and no one pays attention to what happens to the artistes when their shows don’t become what they would have anticipated,” Mguni said. <img class="wp-image-610633 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-35-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Depression It is a fact that most local shows pay less and most artistes are still struggling to get local appreciation while foreign acts continue to harvest the little that is available. “Imagine after going through long hours of rehearsals and sleepless nights, a few people show up to the show or your song doesn’t receive the much-anticipated appreciation. The artiste will go through depression and a sense of failure will overcome them. This then drives them to take drugs and things like suicide. “And because our arts industry is not that paying, most artistes struggle till they are adults. And when they start getting something off their craft, they already have a family that looks up to them, and what they make is still not enough to cover all responsibilities,” said Mguni. He said to try and chip in and offer a shoulder for artistes to lean on, he is offering consultations to them and their families since they are the ones who suffer the most or benefit the most from the artistes’ work. “I’m opening my doors to all artistes who feel that they need help to deal with mental health issues like depression. I’m not doing this for fame, but I just want to give a platform to artistes because I’ve seen the challenges that they come across in the industry and it’s always difficult to address them. <img class="wp-image-530645 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/drugs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/drugs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/drugs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Drugs “Any artiste can feel free to contact me and book a session for mental health support because, at the end of the day, we cannot have depression and suicide being passed from generation to generation in the arts industry,” said Mguni adding that if one comes through for consultations, they are guaranteed that they will be treated with respect and dignity.  Mguni who can be contacted on +263788351102 said he wishes that other medical practitioners and organisations will follow suit and help local artistes overcome mental issues for an improved arts industry in the country. “We need workshops and programmes that will mentor even the up-and-coming artistes to know the demands of the industry and empower them with skills to overcome issues without resorting to anything that will harm them and their careers. “I may not be able to help every artiste around the country, but it’s my hope that other practitioners and organisations can come through and we establish a reliable platform for our artistes,” said Mguni.
