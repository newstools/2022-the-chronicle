The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
VISITING former Malawian President, Dr Joyce Banda, says Lilongwe and Harare should leverage on their common history and closely work together in marketing the diverse tourism products to grow their economies and contribute more to the regional integration drive. Dr Banda arrived in Victoria Falls on Sunday morning and toured the Rainforest in the afternoon with her delegation. She also officiated at a ground breaking ceremony of a pilot horticulture, fishery and citrus plantation project in Hwange’s Msuna area on Monday. The project is being implemented by the Southern African Development Initiators (SADI) and is expected to cushion villagers from the effects of climate change. Dr Banda said she had visited Victoria Falls on numerous occasions but cannot have enough of the magnificent natural wonder given its splendid waterfall and soothing light showers and nature. In an interview in the Rainforest, which is within the Victoria Falls National Park, Dr Banda encouraged people from across the African continent to take time to visit Victoria Falls. <img class="size-full wp-image-607924" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-38-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Victoria Falls National Park She said Malawi and Zimbabwe share a longstanding political and socio-cultural history dating back to pre-colonial era, which also resulted in the establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. “This is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World and I am truly excited as an African that this wonder is in our continent. The world will continue to marvel and come to see this God creation,” she said. The former President said while Zimbabwe boasts of Victoria Falls, Malawi has Nyika plateau also known as Scotland of Africa, Lake Malawi, mountains and other attractions. “We have tourism attractions in Malawi, which when coined with this can market the region. In any case the three countries — Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe were one nation,” said Dr Banda. “We have a lot of things in common.  What we can do post-independence is to find ways of working together to build our economies for the benefit of our people. “We hope all Africans can come here for pilgrimage because I am sure before colonisation our ancestors used to come here for blessings because what we see here is out of this world,” she said.
Dr Banda bemoaned effects of climate change on the motherland but said the Zambezi River across which the Victoria Falls falling blanket of water is, was resilient. “This continent of ours is seriously affected by climate change and most rivers are drying up. But if you come any time to see Victoria Falls, it’s as if someone is pouring water,” she said. “It seems like it is not affected by climate change and for me it is truly a natural wonder of the world,” said Dr Banda. Victoria Falls is the major tourist attraction in the country. Matabeleland North Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Richard Moyo, who welcomed Dr Banda at the airport said tourism is the province’s economic backbone. <img class="wp-image-546429 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/CDE-Richard-Moyo-new.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/CDE-Richard-Moyo-new.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/CDE-Richard-Moyo-new-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland North Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Richard Moyo “Tourism is one of our major drawcards in the province, which makes us the prime destination of Zimbabwe. All we need is rigorous marketing of all resources in our province for investors and tourists to come,” he said. “The Victoria Falls and other projects in the province are already attracting people in other countries to visit,” he said. — @ncubeleon
