THE Environmental Management Agency (EMA) is a proud owner of one of only three state-of-the-art Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Vehicle in Africa. The environmental watchdog exhibited the USD$1 million vehicle at the Zimbabwe International Trade fair (ZITF) which ended in Bulawayo on Sunday. <img class="size-full wp-image-574701" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-23-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-23-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-23-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Zimbabwe International Trade Fair South Africa and Nigeria are the two other countries in Africa with similar vehicles. EMA took delivery of the vehicle that was purchased by the Government in March last year. The vehicle can attend to any chemical spillage which will then be safely disposed. “Government listed to our submission as EMA and we were funded through Treasury. It’s a massive vehicle because it can attend to any amount of chemical spillage. The vehicle, code named Hazmat, was manufactured in Germany but assembled in South Africa. Before operating it, we first had to train our local guys with the help of experts from its origins,” said Ms Amkela Sidange, the EMA Environmental Education and Publicity manager.  The vehicle is equipped with a command centre which has a combination of technology systems for communication, video and audio recording, visibility of the scene. It has weather monitoring systems, and even an enclosed laboratory to test chemicals on board. <img class="size-full wp-image-488204" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Ms-Amkela-Sidange.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Ms-Amkela-Sidange.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Ms-Amkela-Sidange-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Amkela Sidange Hazardous materials can include explosives, flammable and combustible substances, poisons and radioactive materials. Meanwhile, EMA has expressed concern with the attitude of Zimbabweans towards environmental pollution especially passengers on both public and private transport. <img class="size-full wp-image-605595" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pollution “Our attitude as Zimbabweans on the issue of pollution of our environment is worrying. A case in particular is people travelling to South Africa, you realise that when they are on the Zimbabwean side, they just throw litter haphazardly but once they cross the border, nothing of that sort happens because they know the consequences and you wonder why then not practice the same in your own country,” said one of the EMA officials who was manning their stand at the ZITF stand.
