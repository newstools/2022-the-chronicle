Parliament is conducting the budget feedback consultations in line with Section 141 of the Constitution. Last November, Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube presented a $927 billion budget in Parliament that was hailed as people-centred. President Mnangagwa later assented to the legislation that operationalised the National Budget. Anchored on the theme: “Reinforcing Sustainable Economic Recovery and Resilience”, the budget is expected to drive development in Matabeleland region and enhance its contribution to the mainstream economy and job creation. <img class="wp-image-579801 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/dam.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/dam.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/dam-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Hwange Thermal Power Station Among the key projects in Matabeleland that received attention in the budget was the giant Lake Gwayi-Shangani project, which is the major component of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project, the US$1,4 billion Hwange Thermal Power Station Units 7 and 8 expansion, the US$300 million Beitbridge Border Post modernisation and construction of Tuli-Manyange Dam.
