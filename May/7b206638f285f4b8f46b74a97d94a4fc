In her response after the clean-up, Minister Ndlovu told Chronicle that it has always been the Government’s belief that citizens must voluntarily participate in the exercise in order to keep their environment clean and free from pollution but if that does not become the case, Government may be forced to craft laws as similar to Rwanda. “However, if we note that the trend to shun this program continues, we may be forced to come up with laws that make it mandatory for all of us to take part. Every one of us must have a conscience and that inner voice telling him or her of the need to participate in this noble program,” said Minister Ndlovu.
