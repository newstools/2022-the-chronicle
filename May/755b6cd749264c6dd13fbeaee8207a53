We will get to see corporates, women from the Matobo district, and other food experts meet in one place to showcase traditional food as well as teach people which crops to plant given the climate change. The expo is a showcase of the climate change resilience skills of the local people. The expo will also provide deeper knowledge into the role of villages in promoting food security, nutrition, and job creation in African communities. Much focus will be on village entrepreneurship, food regulations for exporting in agriculture, novel foods, traditional foods, food safety in villages, the role of culture in the marketing mix, recipe documentation and formulations, packaging technologies and a new African culinary experience,” Ndlovu said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606582" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Amagugu-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Amagugu-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Amagugu-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some of the traditional dishes to be exhibited at the expo include sorghum beer, isitshwala, umkumbi, umcaba and umxhanxa among others.
