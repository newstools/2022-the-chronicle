CHICKEN INN appear to have pulled a fast one on title rivals Dynamos by snatching the signature of their former striker Clive Augusto barely 24 hours after the striker was linked with a move to DeMbare. The move is likely to add excitement to the title race, which so far is revolving around the two sides.  Dynamos are on 29 points, just two ahead of Chicken Inn after 13 rounds of action. Augusto was among five other players reportedly released by Caps United on Monday for alleged sabotage after leading a strike and delaying the start of their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against Cranborne Bullets. Caps lost the game 0-2 and management reacted by wielding the axe on Augusto, Rodwell Chinyengetere, Ronald Chitiyo, Dennis Dauda, Devon Chafa and goalkeeper Simba Chinani. <img class="size-full wp-image-450234" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Ronald-Chitiyo.gif" alt="" width="680" height="380" /> Ronald Chitiyo However, Chafa, Chinyengetere and Chitiyo were forgiven and taken back by the club, and all indications were pointing to Augusto joining Dynamos, but the GameCocks announced late yesterday that the striker was back “home”. “Welcome back home son. He is a Gamecock,” Chicken Inn tweeted. Augusto, who won the Castle Lager Premiership Golden Boot in 2019 with 14 goals despite leaving for greener pastures mid-season, was unable to replicate that form at Maritzburg United in the South African Premier Soccer League. He was eventually released by the KwaZulu-Natal-based club without scoring a goal and with no assist in six league games and three cup appearances for them. Augusto resurfaced at South African second tier side Uthongathi FC, but was released after again failing to bang in a single goal in nine appearances for the club. He joined Caps United in August 2021 under coach Darlington Dodo. — @innocentskizoe
