Umzingwane MP Brigadier General (Retired) Levi Mayihlome said the festival is meant to rediscover lost traditions. “As Umzingwane, we want to rediscover lost traditions and trace where we went wrong. It’s imperative for us to appreciate how things were done in our ancient tradition and culture. “These celebrations will be all-inclusive to help the young and old merge ideas and share information on cultural subjects,” said Brig Gen Mayihlome.  He added that there will be discussions and presentations on cultural customs and acceptable behaviour. He said festivities will include traditional dances, drama sketches, maskandi music, gospel and poetry competitions as well as free traditional gourmets for attendees. IsiNdebele traditional dances including Isitshikitsha, Majukwa, amaHosana will be on full exhibit where Iyasa will be the guest entertainment group. Locally brewed traditional beer will also be provided during the celebrations. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611173 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-12-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-12-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-12-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The MP implored civic leaders to exhibit exemplary behaviour by attending such gatherings. “We urge our civil leaders to attend and set an example for the people. These are the guards of our traditional customs and having them in our midst will be welcome,” he said.
