TWO malaria deaths have been recorded in Matabeleland South Province since the start of the year while one case was recorded during the same period last year. Last year the province recorded four deaths. In 2021 the province recorded 887 malaria cases while 3 095 were recorded in 2020. In 2019 the province recorded 997 cases. The high increase in 2020 has been attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. Most cases have been recorded in Beitbridge, a development which has been attributed to cross-border activities.  Out of the 3 095 cases that were reported in 2020, 2707 were recorded in Beitbridge. Of the 887 cases that were recorded in 2021, a total 746 were recorded in Beitbridge. This year 244 cases have been recorded so far and 227 of these were recorded in Beitbridge. The province is set to roll out mass long lasting insecticidal net (LLINs) mass distribution exercise which is expected to be completed by end of June. The programme is funded by the Global Fund through Plan International Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-606169 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Long lasting insecticidal net The distribution is targeting 17 wards in Gwanda District and 15 wards in Beitbridge. Speaking during a stakeholders sensitisation meeting in Gwanda yesterday, field officer in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Mr Nhlanhla Nsindane said mining activities in the province have also led to importation of malaria cases from malaria-prone areas. He said the two malaria death cases reported in the province were recorded in Filabusi and Bulilima districts. “We will be starting mass distribution of LLINs targeting Beitbridge and Gwanda districts which have the highest malaria burden. In other districts we will be conducting surveillance activities. Cross-border activities are one of the reasons why we have many cases in Beitbridge,” he said. “We handle a number of people as a province that will be passing through the borders. We have treated people that will be coming from as far as the Democratic Republic of Congo who will be travelling to Botswana or South Africa. We also have people that will be coming from other provinces to conduct mining activities in the province.” He said illegal cross-border activities in Limpopo and Beitbridge areas were also a cause for some of the malaria cases. Mr Nsindane said there were also some illegal mining activities in Limpopo which were attracting locals who were crossing into South Africa illegally. He said this year’s distribution of LLINs would be continuous. Mr Nsindane said after the mass distribution, mosquito nets will be available at clinics so that villagers could access them when need arises. “This time nets will be delivered by our teams to their homes because of Covid-19. The distribution process will be continuous as we will be covering gaps that may arise during the course of the time. If a household needs to replace a torn net they can access it from the clinic. If there is need for another net to cover additional sleeping space they can access them from clinics,” he said. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 – Image taken from Shutterstock “We have a malaria strategic plan that is running from 2021 to 2025 and the goal is reduce malaria incidence by at least 17 per 1  000 and reduce deaths by at least by 90 percent. It’s also the national plan to eliminate malaria in some districts and in Matabeleland South province we have districts in the province namely, Bulilima, Mangwe, Umzingwane, Insiza  and Matobo which have been targeted for malaria elimination.” Speaking during the same meeting Matabeleland South Provincial Environmental Health Officer, Mr Notho Dube said the province has recorded a significant decrease in the number of malaria cases. He attributed this to various strategies that had been put in place by the Ministry of Health and Child Care. “The malaria cases recorded in the province have been on a downward trend expect in 2020 when we recorded 3 095 cases due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2017 we had 5 480, in 2018 we recorded 2 529, in 2019 we had 997 cases while in 2021 we recorded 887 cases,” Mr Dube said. The country aims to reduce malaria deaths by 90 percent by 2025 as it moves towards malaria elimination. The Ministry of Health and Child Care recently reported that the number of malaria deaths recorded in Zimbabwe has fallen by 70 percent. — @DubeMatutu
