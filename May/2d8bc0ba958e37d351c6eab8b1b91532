The Chronicle Painstaking preparation is the key to a great future. It is impossible to become prodigious without preparing to be such. Develop yourself through skill acquisition and a mindset that will position you for success. Opportunity is created daily (as we pray for our daily bread) and yet only a few are able or equipped to seize it. Growing up, I knew that I was going to be a Prophet of God. I therefore changed my lifestyle, character, behaviour and prayer life to assimilate what I was going to become. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605191" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Proverbs 21:31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle, But deliverance is of the LORD. (NKJV) Similarly, if you want to become a multimillionaire you have to begin paying attention to detail (develop a spirit of excellence), how you spend your time, how you dress etc.; you cannot spend time with gossips. Abraham Lincoln said, “I will prepare and someday my chance will come!” When the desire to become a president was birthed in Abraham Lincoln’s heart he prepared, he equipped himself to become a great man. As a Spirit-filled young man, I told myself repetitively that I would study to prepare myself because someday my chance would come and it happened. <img class="size-full wp-image-606411" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-71.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-71.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-71-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Abraham Lincoln (Photo Credit: Getty Images) I was taught by my father that elephants do not bite but mosquitoes do and they cause malaria! People pay attention to major tendencies and ignore the small, seemingly insignificant habits, which leave room for them to become character traits that can keep you bound in poverty. Identify those small foxes and change; deal with them before they affect your destiny. You can achieve greatness. Change your dress code, be clean, make sure you smell good and look presentable at all times.  You do not choose the family or status you are born into. So, it is not a sin to be born poor but it is a sin to die in that state. Change your conduct, show signs that you believe in where you are going. Even the way you talk must portray an individual who is going somewhere in life. Will you be adequately prepared when your opportunity arises?
