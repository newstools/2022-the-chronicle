The Chronicle Melissa Mpofu, Showbiz Editor Organisers of the Vic Falls Carnival have issued a statement apologising for the non-appearance of the headline acts, DJ Maphorisa, Kabza de Small and Sha Sha. <img class="size-full wp-image-501208" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Shasha-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Shasha-1-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Shasha-1-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sha Sha The trio was billed to perform on Friday and simply pulled a no-show. Organisers who were made to believe that the artistes missed their flights tried, by all means, to arrange for flights today, but failed according to a statement that was released today. “To all our loyal Vic Falls Carnival fans, over the past six months, we as a team have worked tirelessly to create our best Vic Falls Carnival edition for its 10th-year celebration at our new and bigger venue with its own standalone dates. We’ve looked to book some of Africa’s top artists from across the continent to make this 10th edition a carnival to remember for you the fans, who have made the Carnival what it is today – a world-renowned festival celebrating Africa and its different cultures. “Day 1 of the Carnival was set to kick off the celebrations with headliners DJ Maphorisa, Kabza De Small and Sha Sha, due to perform on the Pure Africa Sunset Cruise and at the main event later in the evening. DJ Maphorisa, Kabza De Small and Sha Sha did not make their flights and in doing so, have let us down as an event, and more importantly you as fans, who expected their arrival and performances at the Carnival,” wrote organisers. Following their failure to come to the country, some people were speculating that organisers may have failed to pay the artistes on time leading to them aborting the gig. However, organisers cleared the air saying: “All three artists were paid in full and contractually bound to perform at the Carnival, and accommodated at every corner with their numerous flight and accommodation change requests. “Our teams, along with their booking agent, have been trying all weekend to book them on the next available flight into Vic Falls in order for us to reschedule their performances for today. We have tried all avenues to ensure they make it to the Carnival but our team, and their booking agent, are not able to reach them to confirm an alternate plan.” Organisers went on to thank event attendees for their understanding. “Our main priority is you, the fans, who have made the Carnival what it is today and we thank you for that! We thank you for understanding and know that we have done everything possible to accommodate the situation, but due to the communication block between the artists and their booking agent we cannot confirm an alternate plan to get them to the Carnival at this late stage.” The artistes have remained mum on the issue with DJ Maphorisa posting images of him with Kabza with the caption: “Scorpion Kings coming soon.” Some fans asked him why he had not travelled to Vic Falls and the artiste did not respond.
