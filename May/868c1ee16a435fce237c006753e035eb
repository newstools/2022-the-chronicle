FORMER Speaker of Parliament and leader of little-known political party, United Movement for Devolution (UMD), Mr Lovemore Moyo, has rubbished calls for the formation of a government of national unity (GNU) saying such pronouncements are from opposition parties bent on subverting the Constitution. <img class="alignnone wp-image-588742 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/zec-building23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/zec-building23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/zec-building23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Moyo said Zimbabwe is a democratic country which subjects itself to national elections every five years.
General elections are due in 2023. He said GNU calls are peddled by what he termed a “gang” within opposition circles. Speaking on Saturday after launching his party 2023 election manifesto in Njube suburb, he said he won’t be a party to such a move by opposition parties. “You cannot subvert democracy. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612889 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-137.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-137.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-137-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We are a democratic country that fought to achieve democracy. So, the electoral processes are part of the integral democratic dispensation. So, there is no way that you can begin to even theorise and want people to act unconstitutionally. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-546392" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-66Constitutional-Amendment-Number-Two.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-66Constitutional-Amendment-Number-Two.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-66Constitutional-Amendment-Number-Two-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Constitution of Zimbabwe is very clear that after such a period there must be elections.  I don’t see the wisdom of wanting to violate the Constitution for political expedience,” said Mr Moyo. “I am for a situation where people must go for elections. For me to be persuaded towards the formation of a GNU is a difficult proposition. I want people to respect the Constitution, I don’t want to be part of that gang which wants to violate the Constitution. They are calling for dialogue to achieve what? Do they want to form another GNU? You have a party (Zanu PF) that was declared a winner. It must deliver its electoral promises.” <img class="wp-image-605100 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa President Mnangagwa won the 2018 presidential election with more than 50 percent of the vote while Mr Nelson Chamisa, then a presidential candidate for MDC-Alliance got 44,3 percent. <img class="wp-image-485675 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Mr-Nelson-Chamisa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Mr-Nelson-Chamisa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Mr-Nelson-Chamisa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Nelson Chamisa Mr Chamisa challenged the validity of the election, claiming it was fraught with irregularities, but the Constitutional Court upheld President Mnangagwa’s victory in the July 30 harmonised elections, saying the petition by the MDC Alliance leader was deficient in evidence to buttress his rigging claims. — @nqobilebhebhe
