At the end of January 2019, Chitsa phoned Mr Dube advising him that she had conceived a baby boy and he should come to see his child. From that day onwards Mr Dube was allegedly supporting the baby financially but was having second thoughts about the paternity of the child. In April 2022, the court heard that Mr Dube phoned his mother and asked her to meet with Chitsa so that she could have an opportunity to see her grandchild. After seeing the baby, Mr Dube’s mother advised him to take the child for DNA tests if he wanted to be sure he was the father. The court heard that Mr Dube stopped giving financial support to Chitsa. Chitsa approached the Civil Courts for a maintenance payment. <img class="wp-image-613414 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-34-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DNA tests Mr Dube was summoned to appear in court as a respondent for maintenance.
