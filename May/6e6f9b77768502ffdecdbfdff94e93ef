The use of solar energy has become common in new suburbs around Beitbridge town, where the Zimbabwe Electricity and Distribution Company (ZETDC) has been grappling to connect new homes to the electricity grid. <img class="alignnone wp-image-519115 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/solar-panel.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/solar-panel.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/solar-panel-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  It is estimated that there are over 3  000 properties in the newly built areas, where residents have to make use of solar energy and also sink their own boreholes and use septic tanks. As a result, thefts of solar panels and related accessories have become a perennial headache for residents in the area. Beitbridge Town Clerk, Mr Loud Ramakgapola recently said the town had completed connecting 500 properties in the newly built suburbs to water and sewer reticulation facilities. <img class="wp-image-603721 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge Town Clerk, Mr Loud Ramakgapola He said council was mobilising more resources to connect all the outstanding properties to water and sewer reticulation facilities.
