A UNITED Kingdom company that manufactures light construction equipment, Build Works Solutions, is keen to expand its market and promote self-sustainable developmental projects in Zimbabwe. Build Works, which showcased some of its products and equipment at the 62nd edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair last week, is aiming at supplying unique machinery that produces a variety of pre-cast concrete moulds.  In an interview Build Works Solutions agent for Zimbabwe and Southern Africa, Ms Sitha Sipepa, urged Zimbabweans to procure the equipment for small businesses, low-cost housing and to create employment opportunities for communities. “This is an opportunity of a lifetime. The equipment doesn’t use electricity and or fuel. It just relies on man power,” she said. “The equipment has extensively been used in various countries over the last 30 years. We are machine manufacturers who provide a variety of pre-cast concrete moulds for lightweight concrete structures utilising cost-saving techniques for affordable housing, storage equipment and decorative products,” said Ms Sipepa. She said the company’s goal was also to enhance and promote green work practices. “We manufacture manually powered equipment, which does not require electricity or fuel. The equipment helps create affordable, good quality housing and social health and educational facilities, which in turn help counteract migration by enhancing the quality of life of existing communities,” said Ms Sipepa. She said the equipment also offers excellent opportunities to engage unemployed people. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606409" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/y.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/y.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/y-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We want to engage the Government through relevant ministries to ensure that the product is readily available in the market.
“Each machine requires up to 12 people to operate within any 10-hour shift. What this means is that they will be placed in sets of three,” said Ms Sipepa. “Four will collect and deliver raw material to the unit, four will load material, manufacture the blocks/tiles. Then the other four will take the manufactured blocks or tiles to storage.” Ms Sipepa said a number of communities across Southern Africa had benefited from the equipment and hoped to see Zimbabwe do the same. “Projects will also make significant contributions to both public and private sectors. As projects yield results and expand, so will the economy,” she said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606412" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/qw.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/qw.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/qw-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “In essence when projects mature, more employment opportunities will be available and this will be beneficial to the Government’s aim to achieve a middle-class economy by the year 2030,” said Ms Sipepa. So far, she said their company had managed to identify several agents in Zimbabwe and would soon be training them on the usage of the equipment before a consignment of the equipment is delivered. “Our plan is to have approval from the Government, as we want to work hand in glove with them. This will be beneficial to both our countries and people,” said Ms Sipepa.  “There are many vulnerable communities in the country and with these projects many stand a chance to benefit. Also, there are many who have been left homeless and displaced owing much to natural hazards such as cyclones and floods. “This can award them the chance to rebuild and get their lives back on track,” she added.
