HIGHLANDERS defender Andrew Tandi underwent a successful operation at a local hospital. Tandi will be on the sidelines for an unspecified period after fracturing his right fibula (calf bone) and dislocating his ankle in the abandoned Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium last Sunday. Bosso team doctor Shepherd Khumalo said the defender was operated on last Thursday. <img class="wp-image-599866 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-5-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Barbourfields Stadium “The operation was a success. We now wait for the specialist to advise on the way forward,” said Khumalo.
Tandi’s procedure involved a metal supported by pins put on the fracture, with the pins set to be taken off after six weeks. He will remain with the metal pin until he fully recovers. Khumalo could not be drawn into stating how long Tandi will be on the sidelines. However, recovery period for fractured fibula ranges between three and six months depending on the gravity. The local orthopaedic surgeon who operated on Tandi has done procedures on a number of footie stars who include Winston Mhango and McClive Phiri.  The specialist operated on Mhango in October 2013 after the midfielder suffered a career threatening injury when he fractured his tibia during a match between Shabanie Mine and FC Platinum. Mhango stayed on the sidelines for 14 months and only returned to action in 2015. In May 2019, Phiri stayed on the sidelines for 12 weeks when he fractured his right humerus after a violent push by Herentals midfielder Tinotenda Benza during a league match. Writing on his Facebook page yesterday, Tandi thanked the support he is getting from concerned friends and fans. He also said he is recovering well following the operation. — @ZililoR
