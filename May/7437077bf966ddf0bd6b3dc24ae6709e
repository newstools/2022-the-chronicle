For clamping $636 072.00 was collected in local currency, R510.00 and US$1 982.00 in 43 days. The amount has been steadily rising with each passing month. According to the local authority over 50 vehicles are clamped daily on undesignated parking areas in Bulawayo’s city centre since the new parking system came into effect in February. Motorists are required to pay $2 190 to drive away their cars that would have been clamped. Initially, the parking fee was pegged at US$1 for 30 minutes, but the council bowed down to pressure and reduced it. <img class="size-full wp-image-461106" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Christopher-Dube1q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Christopher-Dube1q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Christopher-Dube1q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube Transgressions include parking on yellow lines, on taxi and disabled parking bays or just those who park in the middle of the road and leave their vehicles there. Since the implementation of the new parking system in February this year on a zone stretching from Samuel Parirenyatwa to Lobengula Street and from 3rd Avenue to 15th Avenue, parking on the peripheries of this area has filled up as motorists run away from paying US$1 per hour or at the prevailing auction rate. However, according to the council report, Town Clerk, Mr Christopher Dube told councillors that delays in implementing the parking management system in the whole Central Business District were as a result of challenges faced by the local authority in demarcating and marking roads. These challenges were attributed to the unavailability of material. — @nqobilebhebhe
