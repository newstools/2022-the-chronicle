CENTRAL Region Soccer League pacesetters Sheasham have signed former national Under-20 midfielder Pride Ziwengwa and ex-Caps United wingback Tawana Chikore as they continue with their title charge. <img class="alignnone wp-image-607771 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ziwengwa and Chikore, both aged 27, failed to make their debuts last weekend as their opponents Filabusi United did not turn-up for the league clash at Gweru Sports Club, resulting in Sheasham being awarded maximum points on a 3-0 score line. Ziwengwa has previously had stints with Caps United and Bantu Rovers. John Nyikadzino, the Sheasham coach, said Ziwengwa and Chikore are the only additions to his squad for the second-half of the season, which resumed after a seven-week mid-season break. <img class="size-full wp-image-607765" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-19-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-19-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-19-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> John Nyikadzino, the Sheasham coach “We didn’t want to disturb the combinations we had built from the first-half, hence we just made two signings to strengthen our side for the remainder of the season. It’s still early days as far as the promotional race is concerned, and that’s why we saw the need to go for experience,” said Nyikadzino. He was unhappy that Filabusi failed to turn up for their game, denying him an opportunity to measure his players’ performances following a lengthy break. “As a coach, I prefer to win points on the field of play than a walkover. We had prepared well for the Filabusi game and not to play when other teams are active leaves us at a disadvantage,” said Nyikadzino.  After benefitting from the walkover, Sheasham took their points’ tally to 34 after 14 outings. They lead second-placed former Premier Soccer League side TelOne FC by four points.
