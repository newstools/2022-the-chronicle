This was the vision behind the creation of Kunye events. I’m proud that this special edition was done in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and it has marked us a brand that is true in uniting people through music despite race, nationality and ethnic differences,” said Shimza. As he took the main stage at the carnival, those who had attended Kunye at the Lookout could attest that the All Alone hitmaker gave his best despite performing earlier. <img class="size-full wp-image-605748" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sun El Musician “The energy you give during a performance must not depend on the crowd. Even if 100 people are present, you have to perform your best as when 5 000 people are part of the audience. “As a DJ, I have a way of doing things and giving them quality entertainment is the major reason why I am DJ Shimza today. The crowds at both Kunye and the Vic Falls Carnival main stage were amazing. I had to give all of me on both of my sets,” said DJ Shimza.
