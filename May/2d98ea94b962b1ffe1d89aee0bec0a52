TOP Bulawayo-based boxing referee Steven Masiyambumbi is back in the country after officiating at the Women’s Boxing Championships in Turkey. Masiyambumbi, who arrived back in the country yesterday, judged four bouts and was also the referee in one of the semi-finals. This  is the fourth time he has officiated at an international competition. “It was quite an experience for me especially being the first African from Zimbabwe to officiate at such a high level. It’s a big achievement for me and the country. “I also learned that as Zimbabwe we have a lot of potential in boxing given that our neighbours such as Mozambique went as far as the semi-finals and final. We need to work more on female boxers as a country and if we get more support I believe we can win medals also.  “I performed very well in this tournament and I am happy I had positive recommendations from the World Boxing Federation and hopefully this is the start of more big opportunities to come,” said Masiyambumbi. He is a holder of an AIBA 3-star certificate. An AIBA certificate enables Masiyambumbi to officiate at all levels of amateur boxing. <img class="wp-image-610900 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-14-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-14-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-14-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Women’s Boxing Championships in Turkey. He officiated in his first high-profile game as an AIBA 3-Star certificate holder during the Asian Elite Boxing Championships in May last year. Last year he was invited to attend a course in Dubai and excelled, resulting in him being nominated to officiate in the Men’s World Championships in Serbia. His journey in officiating started in 2014 after Zimbabwe hosted the African Union Sports Council Region 5 Games in Bulawayo. He did his two-star course in Botswana and was crowned the best official in the zone. He has also previously officiated in China, Serbia, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, Angola, Zambia, South Africa and Tanzania. His dream is to officiate at the Olympic Games. — @innocentskizoe
