THE Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) has increased toll fees with effect from today.
The toll fees, however, remain the same in foreign currency. “In terms of Section 4 of Statutory Instrument 32 of 2021, toll fees, which are pegged in foreign currency are payable in local currency at the prevailing foreign currency auction rate,” Zinara said in a statement. Last week the official foreign currency auction system rate was pegged at US$1:Z$258. “Pursuant to that, we would like to advise our valued customers that with effect from Monday 23 May 2022, the following toll fees will apply.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-459945 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Light vehicles will now pay $520 up from $300 while buses fees have been adjusted from $600 to $1 040, said Zinara. Heavy trucks will pay $1 300 up from $750 and haulage trucks fees are now pegged at $2 600 up from $1 500. Motorists living near a tollgate and who frequently pass through the facility will now pay $10 400 up from $6 000. In foreign currency, fees for light motor vehicles are US$2, minibuses (US$3) and buses pay US$4. <img class="wp-image-610990 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-29-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rehabilitate roads- Image taken from Shutterstock Heavy trucks and haulage trucks pay US$5 and US$10 respectively. The Government introduced toll fees in 2009 as part of measures to raise funds to construct and rehabilitate roads. A well-maintained national road infrastructure facilitates trade leading to economic improvement. Through Zinara, the Government has been able to rehabilitate the country’s road network in both rural and urban areas.
