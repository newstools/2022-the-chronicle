ZIMBABWE scooped 14 medals in the South African Children and Youth Championships held in Turffontein, Johannesburg at the weekend. The tournament was contested by Zambia, Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe and host nation South Africa. Zimbabwe’s team was led by Sensei Greatmans Agrippa Sibanda and comprised athletes aged between nine and 17 years.  “They did extremely well and I am proud of them for their fighting spirit, especially since it was their first time to take part in this kind of tournament. There were more than 300 participants and it’s surely not easy to come out with such a number of medals in such a high-profile tournament. The results from the competition are evidence that we are doing well with the sport even after the pandemic,” said Sibanda. The tournament was held in two categories, the katas and the kumite. Katas are patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs. Katas are executed as a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form, whereas kumite is one of the three main sections of karate training, along with kata and kihon. <img class="wp-image-613032 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-25-23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> karate Kumite is the part of karate in which a person trains against an adversary.
