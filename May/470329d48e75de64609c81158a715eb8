The school which is in a resettlement area is operating with two classroom blocks for Grade 1 to Grade 7 learners, which is limiting the school’s enrolment. Matobo Rural District Council has channelled more than $61 million devolution funds towards improving service delivery in the district since 2019. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611385 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/b-copy-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/b-copy-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/b-copy-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Last year the local authority was allocated $42,3 million and the bulk of the money was directed towards outstanding projects. These include Mlugulu Clinic in Ward 24 which is expected to be commissioned soon and construction of Nhlupho Clinic which is nearing completion. Mlugulu Clinic will bring huge relief to the villagers who have to walk 20 kilometres to reach the nearest health centre. The clinic will serve more than five villages in Ward 24. Matobo Rural District Council chief executive officer, Mr Elvis Sibanda said the council is this year expecting to receive $339 million devolution funds which will be channelled towards governance, water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash), roads and public safety and security projects. “Polimagama Primary School is in Ward 21, a resettlement area. The nearest primary school is Malundi Primary School which is a distance of 6km from Polimagama. We have some students walking that distance to Malundi. <img class="size-full wp-image-518664" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/National-dev-strategy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/National-dev-strategy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/National-dev-strategy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Development Strategy 1 The construction of the two classroom blocks will help ease the challenges faced by the students as more learners will be accommodated at Polimagama Primary. We have allocated $9 million towards expansion of the school,” he said. Mr Sibanda said the council is set to adopt several projects within the district which were being funded by the community working with either members of the diaspora or devolution funds. He said the devolution funds will help ensure the projects are completed timeously. “Council has other development projects earmarked to be funded under devolution. These include two blocks for Mabisi Primary School, tower lights for Maphisa Township, completion of Manyane Clinic which is at window level, Sigangatsha Clinic and Sontala Clinic which is at roof level. We also hope to complete Nhlupho Clinic which is also at an advanced stage of completion. Another project we are targeting this year is the drilling of 24 boreholes among others. Council was allocated a total of $339 947 700,00 with a total of $9 million received to date,” Mr Sibanda said.  He said there was a need for timeous release of devolution funds by Government to ensure completion of projects. Matobo Rural District Council has also used devolution funds to rehabilitate schools in various wards in the district such as Sinkamaswe Primary School, Lubhangwe Primary and Secondary, Sankonjwane Primary and Emhlonhlweni Primary School. The funds have also been used for installation of solar street lights and upgrading of ICT infrastructure. “From the inception of devolution funds council has received $61,1 million for community development projects that it has undertaken. Devolution funds have come in handy in improving service delivery in Matobo. Our strategic plan also incorporates the requirements or priorities of the NDS1 pillars which have been guidelines to how we have tried to prioritise our implementation of the devolution funds,” he said.–@DubeMatutu
