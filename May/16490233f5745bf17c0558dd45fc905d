The Chronicle Division
Division talks of disturbing oneness or the action or process of being separated. At a local church if leaders work as a team the church grows in terms of membership. We need each other, we need to work together and we need to support one another. If one department organises a function other departments should support it. Philippians 2: 3 KJV says: “Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteems others better than themselves.” One problem that is common among leaders today is not understanding the difference between when they are in authority and when they are under authority. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605191" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Most people always assume that they should be in authority wherever they are. This is the problem that we are facing today as Christians. Most people want to be in authority wherever they go. There are some people who want to be in control all the time, however, we should learn to sit under authority and submit because it is a sign of maturity. Anyone who is immature lacks in the area of submission. A good leader always encourages his team. Constructive criticism is good because it builds self-esteem and it also motivates the individual, but negative criticism destroys. There are some people who do not see anything good in what others do. This is what brings confusion and division among people. Those who work hard in the house of God end up assuming that they are not doing the proper thing or that someone else can do the job better than them. In life we need to understand that one has to do unto others as they would want them to do unto them.  John 17: 22 KJV: “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” The kingdom of God is about oneness; it is about unity.
