The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior health reporter MEDICAL AID Insurer Cimas has donated state-of-the-art industrial laundry equipment worth more than R500 000 to Thorngrove Infectious Diseases Hospital, a major boost to the Bulawayo institution which is undergoing a face lift. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-482526" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/medical-aid-schemes-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/medical-aid-schemes-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/medical-aid-schemes--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The hospital which is one of the province’s Covid-19 centres, was built in 1941 and its laundry equipment was so dilapidated that it put healthcare workers at risk of infections. As of yesterday, there were 15 Covid-19 patients at the institution who were said to be stable. The number of admissions have been going down since the beginning of this year with 18 being the highest number to be recorded in a month. Besides Covid-19, Thorngrove also offers tuberculosis treatment for Bulawayo residents and people from surrounding areas. Speaking during the handover of the equipment worth R551 609 yesterday, Mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni said the hospital has been using outdated equipment for a long time which was also prone to breakdowns. “Today we are receiving a donation of laundry equipment consisting of an industrial washing machine, ironing set station and industrial dryer worth R551 609. <img class="wp-image-608607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-27-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cimas We know that it has not been an easy feat for Cimas to finance the purchase of these. We are grateful that despite numerous resource constraints bedeviling our companies, they have seen the need to give back to the community that they serve,” said Clr Mguni. He said the council has been refurbishing its health facilities to ensure it provides quality health services. “Most patients admitted to this hospital require specialised care and attention. The specialised care is not only in the medical care we provide but also in the linen and meals that we provide,” said Clr Mguni. He said the hospital is also in need of kitchen equipment as renovations are underway. <img class="wp-image-603666 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-22-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-22-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-22-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Judith Ncube Bulawayo’s Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Cde Judith Ncube said the donation will make a difference for staffers at the hospital. “The health sector faces a number of challenges such as critical shortage of specialised professionals, health care staff and dilapidated infrastructure and lack of essential medicines and commodities. These challenges were exacerbated by the Covid -19 pandemic,” said Cde Ncube. She said partnerships and working together of various stakeholders had reduced the impact of the pandemic in the communities. “These partnerships can be witnessed today as we receive new and state- of- the- art laundry machines. <img class="wp-image-588986 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/covid.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/covid.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/covid-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: Shutterstock These machines are key in infection control and management,” said Minister Ncube. She said the refurbishment of the hospital was part of Government’s commitment towards achieving Vision 2030. “I am happy that when we made the clarion call for partners and for the refurbishment of the hospital, it was well received and there has been great and massive improvements since the year 2020. I recall that a short while ago, we toured the hospital following the opening of the Covid-19 ward. One of the aspects which we noted and which was communicated by the city during the tour was the need to refurbish the laundry and the hospital kitchen,” she said. Cimas chief executive officer Mr Vulindlela Ndlovu said the hospital was key in infectious diseases control now just like it was years ago. “We are happy to be handing over this donation as Cimas. It’s part of our responsibility to ensure that our healthcare institutions are in a position to offer quality services through the use of equipment in good condition.  I was once a patient here a long time ago when I was treated for measles and I know how important it is for the staff to have a functional laundry which makes disease prevention and treatment easier,” said Mr Ndlovu. He said the private sector was very keen to assist the Government and councils in wellness programmes and improving public institutions. “We need to invest in our primary health care centres as they are key in quality healthcare services,” said Mr Ndlovu. –@thamamoe
