THE Government has acquired equipment that will enable the Central Vehicle Registry (CVR) to clear a backlog of 240 000 metal driver’s licences backdating to 2018, a Cabinet Minister has said. The central licensing department has been using obsolete equipment that was acquired long back at a time when very few Zimbabweans had cars and driving. The department has been overwhelmed with new applications as well as requests for lost or duplicate driver’s licences, forcing new drivers to drive using paper and temporary driver’s licences. CVR is servicing over 25 Vehicle Inspectorate depots (VID) doted across the country, which are not metal driver’s licence issuers. In an interview, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona said while the Government is on course to clearing the driver’s licence backlog, the country was moving fully towards the new Southern African Development Community (Sadc) Compliant Driver’s Licence in line with the regional bloc’s Protocol on Transport, Communication and Meteorology which was adopted in 1996. <img class="wp-image-586704 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/paul-nyathi-2-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/paul-nyathi-2-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/paul-nyathi-2-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Felix Mhona “The equipment we had was obsolete but I am glad to say that we have received consumables to clear the backlog from 2018/19 and part of 2020. But what is exciting is the fact that we are now pursuing the new Sadc Compliant Driver’s Licence. Special thanks to the listening President Cde Dr ED Mnangagwa who has directed that we move with speed in fulfilling the wishes and desires of the people of Zimbabwe,” said Minister Mhona. He said those with old metal driver’s licence discs will still use them under the same conditions although the country will not be producing them. According to Minister Mhona, a technical team is already seized with the compliance issues according to set regional standards for the licence and unlike as previously announced that the country will be using the Sadc Compliant licence by next month, Minister Mhona said while the Government was working flat out to expedite the availability of the new licence, the June deadline was no longer feasible. “Remember this is a Sadc licence, it has certain standard features that have to be complied with, so the technical team is working on that to make sure we align with the acceptable standards. We can not meet the June deadline if we have not aligned the licence features to the Sadc Compliant driver’s licence. We are working to make sure we are not partially compliant but fully compliant,” said Minister Mhona. <img class="alignnone wp-image-606550 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-96.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-96.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-96-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> According to Article 6.10 of the Sadc Protocol on Transport, Communication, and Meteorology, a Member State shall issue, upon successful completion of the relevant test in respect of a certain licence code, a driving licence for the categories to be agreed upon while also adopting a harmonised format for driving licences. “Each Member State shall recognise driving licences issued according to the agreed Sadc codes and format by other Member States or an international driving permit as corresponding and equal to its own, and for this purpose, a licence issued in one Member States shall be valid for the driving of a vehicle in respect of which it has been issued in any other Member State. Member States shall harmonise learner’s licence testing and codes with a view to encouraging the mutual recognition of each other’s learner’s licences.  The provisions of this Article shall also apply to professional driving permits or other documentation issued for the same purpose. Member States shall require drivers to carry their driving licences and professional permits, as the case may be, at all times during a journey on a public road,” reads Article 6.10. Besides the driving licence agreements, Member States shall corporate in harmonising traffic management operations and take steps to adopt and implement harmonised and minimum standards on traffic signs and signals, road signs and markings, rules of the road, speed limits appropriate to road design, driving signals and driving hours.
