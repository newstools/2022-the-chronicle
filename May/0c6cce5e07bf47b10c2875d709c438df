CANCER presents a double challenge for patients living in rural areas as they do not have access to specialised care or the finances to fund treatment. This has in some instances resulted in poor palliative care. After failing to access medical attention, some cancer patients turn to traditional healers who in some instances aggravate their conditions. Ms Janet Moyo (70) from Filabusi said she was diagnosed with cervical cancer a few months ago after noticing continuous bleeding.  “I went to the hospital where several tests were done and I was told I had cervical cancer. I couldn’t afford the treatment required so I went back home. After a while, I went for some prayers with a healer in Filabusi and I started to feel strong again. The bleeding even started to ease up but I didn’t go back to the hospital to get checked,” said Ms Moyo. She said she had to move in with her niece after she started bleeding again. “I grew weak again but I still couldn’t afford the treatment the doctors said I needed so I have just been sitting at home managing the bleeding,” said Ms Moyo. According to health experts, depending on the type and stage of one’s cancer, they may need more than one type of treatment.
For the earliest stages of cervical cancer, either surgery or radiation combined with chemotherapy may be used. For later stages, radiation combined with chemotherapy is usually the main treatment. Chemotherapy by itself is often used to treat advanced cervical cancer. For many like Ms Moyo, traditional healers believed to treat cancers are a viable option. <img class="size-full wp-image-610305" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Traditional-Healer.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="388" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Traditional-Healer.jpg 674w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Traditional-Healer-360x207.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /> A Traditional doctor Traditional healer Baba Ndebele said he has seen cancer patients before but would rather not treat them particularly if they have previously sought medical attention. “I don’t attend to cancer cases in most instances because if one has been to the hospital or sought treatment elsewhere, it becomes difficult to treat it. In some instances, you end up disturbing the medical treatment plan and cause someone’s death,” said Baba Ndebele. He said cancer is like a reptile and treating it traditionally requires one to drink a mix of certain herbs and also apply the herbs to the wound. “When treating someone with cancer, the patient is not supposed to pay anything until they’re healed then they can thank you in a way they see fit but the problem is that people are not honest. “Once they are healed, they forget to come back and pay homage that’s why I don’t like treating cancer patients,” said Baba Ndebele. Matabeleland South provincial medical director Dr Rudo Chikodzero said the province offers comprehensive services for cancer patients that range from prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and palliative service. “These services are offered to different extents depending on the particular cancer that our patients will be having. Cancers that have running programmes include cervical and breast cancer among others,” said Dr Chikodzero. She said specialist health care workers and equipment were still a challenge. “The challenges in this area include specialist health care workers, equipment and financing. The Government is working on these issues gradually with the decentralisation of specialist care, rehabilitation and equipment of health care facilities through the PSIP projects,” said Dr Chikodzero. — @Yolisswa
