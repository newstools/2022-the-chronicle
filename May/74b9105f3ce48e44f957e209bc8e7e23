ZANU-PF Second Secretary, Cde Kembo Mohadi has urged African countries to urgently harmonise their production processes leveraging on the continent’s rich natural resources to create wealth so that they are able to compete with developed nations. In an interview on Wednesday, Cde Mohadi singled out Africa as one of the richest continents in the world, saying it is capable of developing using its own collective resources. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612330 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-28-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-28-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-28-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said Africa Day should be used as an opportunity by Africans to reflect on the freedom they are enjoying as a result of the selfless sacrifice of the founding fathers. Zimbabwe on Wednesday joined the rest of the continent in commemorating Africa Day. “Africa is one of the richest continents in the world and most of the European countries benefited from Africa. African resources built those capitals and as a continent we must now focus more on building ourselves,” said Cde Mohadi. “This day has a great significance and it’s important that we celebrate as we relive the ideas and ideals of our forefathers.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-612333 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-30-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Mohadi said Africans must embrace their cultural diversity“A nation or continent without a culture is dead. The unity we are talking about is unity in our diversity,” he said. Cde Mohadi said citizens should work to develop Africa to become a world power house. “We need to use our own resources as Africa to develop ourselves so that we are able to compete at the same level with other continents,” he said. Cde Mohadi said Southern Africa was liberated because of the sacrifices made by revolutionary leaders who fought colonialism among other social injustices. The ruling party’s Vice-President and Second Secretary said Africa’s founding fathers had envisioned a unified and developed Africa and as such leaders should continue to push to make this dream a reality. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612339 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-31-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He singled out the likes of Ghana’s founding President Kwame Nkrumah as leaders who pushed an agenda of a united Africa with a single currency and passport. The late Nkrumah led Ghana, formerly known as Gold Coast, to independence from Britain in 1957. “We ended up coming up with the five regional economic blocs and ours being the Sadc, which are working towards achieving and fulfilling the desires of our founding leaders, which we still cherish. We believe that a united Africa is what is needed to overcome the challenges of the continent which were as a result of the split into spheres of influence by colonisers during the 1884 partition of Africa in Berlin,” said Cde Mohadi. He said a united Africa will not only accelerate development of the continent but will also help end political strife and endless conflicts.  Cde Mohadi said the country has significantly gained from the works of the African revolutionary leaders. Africa Day is the annual commemoration of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now African Union (AU) on 25 May 1963.
