This is contained in a joint statement released by the two companies yesterday. In addition, the investment will allow DPA to generate hundreds of new construction jobs in the country, adding a much-needed boost to the local economy.  “South Africa is facing long hours of load shedding and increasing electricity costs. This partnership comes at an opportune time when the country is pushing for updated renewable energy policy, and the world is facing a sudden rise in diesel costs,” said Mr Norman Moyo, CEO Africa of DPA. <img class="alignnone wp-image-611602 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “As a business of Cassava Technologies, our achievements and initiatives ensure that we enable social mobility and the economic prosperity of individuals and businesses across the continent through increased access to innovative technologies.” EDF Group is already active in low-carbon power generation, transmission, distribution and energy efficiency services in South Africa.
