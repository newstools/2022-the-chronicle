The mining venture joins other mining companies that are producing power for their own use and offloading excess onto the national grid. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142421" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="394" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines.jpg 630w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines-239x150.jpg 239w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines-435x272.jpg 435w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines-280x175.jpg 280w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/powerlines-560x350.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /> “Second, we are expecting to build up a 110-kilometre power line from Tokow via Masvingo to Bikita of 132 KVA, which will improve the state grid and benefit surrounding communities. “Third, we are expecting to recruit more than 1 000 local employees after commissioning of the new spodumene plant, which will create more work opportunities for local community and following with a more harmonious community atmosphere.”  Spodumene is a lithium used to make batteries, while petalite is a lithium mineral that is used in the production of glass and ceramics. After completion of investment and construction, it said it envisages an annual foreign exchange income of US$300 million which also means that the Government will receive more tax for utility use. — nqobilebhebhe
