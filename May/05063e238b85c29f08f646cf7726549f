The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter The National Art Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo will play host to the city’s young musicians who will share the stage at a gig dubbed “House, Kwaito Movement” this Saturday. The much-anticipated show that is part of efforts to promote local talent will be headlined by Novuyo Seagirl, Skaiva, Mawiza, Mzistozz Mfanafuthi, Tebza, Boocy and Can’t Get Music. A brainchild of Dab Three Events, the event taking place at the gallery’s car park will be hosted by Sipho Mercent Nyathi. Dab Three Events director Archford Hadebe said the idea behind the event is to give local artistes platforms to showcase their art. “The idea behind the show is to give our artistes platforms to perform because they carry a very big message which they want to be heard. This is the cream of our region and there’s no better time than now to fully stand behind them and give them the solidarity that they deserve,” said Hadebe. He said through the show, they want local artistes to stamp their authority with the hope that in the future, they can spread their wings across the whole Matabeleland region as well as the country. – @mthabisi_mthire
