ZIFA say Highlanders should have appointed a coach for their next game against Harare City as they only allowed Joel Luphahla to be in charge of one game while Bosso sought a qualified gaffer. Luphahla took charge of Bosso in their 0-0 draw against ZPC Kariba at Nyamhunga Stadium on Saturday.  Luphahla is not a holder of a Caf A coaching badge as required by the Fifa club licensing to be in charge of a topflight league team. Under the Fifa club licensing policy, which Zifa implemented, a coach without a Caf A coaching licence can’t sit on the team bench as head coach on match day. Without a Caf A badge, a coach needs a special waiver from Zifa to take charge of a Premier Soccer League team. Judging from the Zifa directive, Luphahla will not be getting a second waiver and a new coach is the only way out for Bosso for Sunday’s match. <img class="size-full wp-image-589133" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Xolisani-Gwesela-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Xolisani-Gwesela-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Xolisani-Gwesela-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Xolisani Gwesela “We just allowed them to have Luphahla on the bench in order for them to get their house in order, but Highlanders should have appointed a qualified coach in their next game,” said Zifa competitions and communications manager Xolisani Gwesela. Highlanders are expected to name a new coach any time this week, with the club revealing that it had received over 20 CVs for the job last week. <img class="size-full wp-image-613275" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Briton-Mark-Harrison.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Briton-Mark-Harrison.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Briton-Mark-Harrison-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Briton Mark Harrison Some of the coaches believed to have lodged their CVs are former coaches, Briton Mark Harrison, Zambian Kelvin Kaindu, Dutchman Pieter de Jongh, Amini Soma-Phiri and Egyptian Mohamed Fathi, as well as Mexican Javier Martinez Espinosa, Serbian Heric Vladislav and former Bulawayo City coach Philani “Beefy” Ncube, among others. — @innocentskizoe
