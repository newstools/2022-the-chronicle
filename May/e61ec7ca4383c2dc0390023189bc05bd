The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Online Reporter ZIMBABWE on Sunday joined the rest of the world in commemorating Workers’ Day amid calls by trade unions for the promotion of social dialogue and meaningful consultations and consensus among social partners to address issues revolving around the welfare of workers. The workers also urged Government to decisively deal with corruption both in public and private sectors. This year’s Workers’ Day Commemorations, held under the theme “restoration of workers’ dignity” come at a time when salaries have been eroded due to incessant price hikes and profiteering necessitated by the weakening of the local currency. President Mnangagwa’s administration under the Second Republic has made the welfare of workers its top priority and is also working to ensure better relations between the private sector and the Government. For the first time in two years, workers physically gathered at various venues across the country to commemorate this year’s commemorations. Public gatherings were last held in 2019 owing to the Covid-19restrictions In Bulawayo, the commemorations, which were organised by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), took place at Stanley Square in Makokoba. ZCTU first vice president Mr Valentine Chikosi, who was the guest of honour, delivered the union president Ms Florence Mucha Taruvinga’s message to the workers.
