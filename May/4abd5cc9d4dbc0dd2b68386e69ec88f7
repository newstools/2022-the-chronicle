The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter FOUNDER of the Changamire Hip Hop Festival Awards, personality Zimboy has said the next edition of the awards ceremony slated for next year will be held in Bulawayo. This year’s edition was held last month at Wood Pub and Grill in Harare where rapper Holy Ten was the biggest winner with four accolades in the categories Best Male, People’s Choice, Best Hip Hop Group and Song of the Year. Other notable winners were T Mula who won Hip Hop Personality of the Year and Hip Hop Socialite of the Year and Oceane Le Ren X who won Best Promoter. Roki and Enzo Ishall won one award each in the Best Alternative Act and Best Hip Hop verse respectively. Zimboy said they are on a drive to promote the genre countrywide hence why they are planning on hosting the next edition outside the capital city. “We want to host the event outside Harare starting with Bulawayo and then Gweru. We’ll also be bringing more international acts so that we create a synergy of collaborations with local and foreign artistes. “We are glad to have had another successful ceremony where we managed to bring regional artiste Costa Titch for our nominees’ party,” said Zimboy.
