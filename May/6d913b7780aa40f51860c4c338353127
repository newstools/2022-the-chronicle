Gibbonz, a member of Gwanda music outfit GDA Fire mourned Shallah saying the town’s arts fraternity has been robbed. “We once worked with her as GDA Fire on the track, Isibane Sami. It was a good experience as we also got to mentor her. Her death was shocking as it left us poorer. Gone too soon as her future was bright.”  Producer DJ Drumz said: “I think I was the first producer to work with her. During the first lockdown, we spent a lot of time with the likes of Ronny B, Gibbonz, Master Zhoe and Cutie G as we worked on various projects. The news of her death was quite disheartening.” Kay_Kid Umfanomsotho said it was saddening to lose a talented vocalist who he planned to work with on a song. – @mthabisi_mthire
