The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter
FROM the thickets of Nkayi to gracing leading South African film projects is a journey that actor Mpilo Moyo has travelled. His journey started decades back at Nkulumane High School where he developed the love of an art that puts one in the limelight. This is a man who has raised the country’s flag high with roles on South African soapies that include Diep City and Gomora. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612655 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Recently, he landed a role and Mzansi Magic’s Skeem Saam. Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Mthabisi Tshuma (MT) caught with Mpilo Moyo (MM) from his South African base and he gave a detailed brief of his life and how he ended up as an actor. Below are excerpts of the interview: MT: Can you tell us about yourself? MM: My name is Mpilo Moyo. I was born on the 9th of February, 1968 at Nkayi Hospital. I did my primary school education at Gandi Primary School and my O-level at Nkulumane High School.  I enrolled for a Marketing Degree with Unisa but I didn’t finish. I’ve done many other numerous courses and currently, I’m a fire consultant for a private company in South Africa. MT: What inspired you to be a film practitioner and which productions have you been part of thus far? MM: Acting had always been my dream as early as primary school level. Growing up, I couldn’t explore this talent as my grandparents who raised me thought acting was not right. However, I remember many years ago when I was at primary school, I acted as Ndlambe, an old man who was overwhelmed by the city, the cars and robots koBulawayo. <img class="wp-image-612405 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-50-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-50-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-50-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo That was classic and made me fall in love with acting. At secondary school, I acted as Julius Caesar and both names stuck with me. Ironically, my first professional acting stint was on the big screen in a Zimbabwean movie called Shaina. I acted that role here in South Africa where I was featured as a shop manager. Thereafter, I featured in a GOtv commercial among other projects. I was also cast as umalume on Diep City, thereafter as Umdala in Gomora, and a detective on e.tv’s An eye for an eye. Now, I’ve been cast as a doctor on Skeem Saam, a role that I’m passionate about. I hope that the character will grow. MT: How have you managed to grapple the growth of the South African film industry and the roles you have played? MM: I’m aware that this is just the beginning and yet it’s a long journey. I’m prepared to walk for as long as it takes. In future, my eyes are set on the big screens and God willing, Hollywood here I come. I love acting and would trade everything for it as it makes me feel real. It allows one to be themselves. It’s as good as painting on canvas. MT: When were you last in Zimbabwe and how do you view the country’s film industry? MM: I left Zimbabwe in 2000 and was last there over 20 years ago. <img class="alignnone wp-image-612651 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-32-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-32-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-32-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The film industry there needs to be resuscitated as I believe it reflects suffocating people and yet, there’re so many good stories to be told. The art industry is a mirror of any society, thus people must be allowed to tell the stories, no matter how painful – it is therapy. – @mthabisi_mthire
