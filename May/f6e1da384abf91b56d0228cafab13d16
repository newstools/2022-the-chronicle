The Chronicle John 10 vs 27 “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.” In this fast-paced world we live in, we are always surrounded by people, things and voices that are contrary to the voice of the Lord. We hardly ever get a moment to just sit in silence and listen to our thoughts, and more importantly to the voice of God. Most of us are so used to being occupied by something or the other that we are actually intimidated by silence and solitude. What brings about this fear? Are we afraid of our own thoughts or that we will have to address the issues we have been running away from? Yet we must not be scared of silence for it is in those quiet moments that the Holy Spirit speaks to your soul, when the voice of the Lord becomes clear. If you listen intently and not allow anything to distract you, you will hear Him.  God speaks to us in many ways; He speaks through creation, through His creativity and majesty, He can speak to us through His word, He speaks through other people like mentors and wise elders. He also speaks through situations, the dreams you have, the vision you see, the nudging you feel in the spirit to go in a certain direction or even through closed doors. If you want to hear God, you have to quiet your mind and we can do this through prayer and meditation. We must learn to silence our fearful and anxious thoughts and allow the Holy Spirit to minister to us. Take some time everyday to just be alone, be still and listen to His voice. There lies wisdom, guidance, direction and the answer to all you have been seeking. Be blessed
