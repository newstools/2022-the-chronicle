ARENEL Movers coach Kudzayi Mhandire says his players were left heartbroken after losing 1-0 to Hwange at the Colliery Stadium under controversial circumstances in a Zifa Southern Region Division One clash on Saturday. The game had been touted by many as a “title decider” and had so much tension throughout. Hwange’s goal was scored in the 42nd minute via the spot kick converted by captain Kelly Shiyandindi. <img class="size-full wp-image-607593" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-77-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-77-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-77-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> captain Kelly Shiyandindi Arenel were not happy with the awarding of the penalty and their technical team is reported to have confronted referee Donacious Munenge at full-time protesting the decisions made in the match. “It was a good game for us in the sense that we did everything that a football team should do to win a football  game. “We did everything by the book.  We fought hard, but unfortunately other forces were at play, hence we lost the game. It widens the gap at the top. Some things you cannot control,” said Mhandire. “The destiny was not in our hands. The best thing to do is to let things go, but it was a hard pill to swallow. We know it happens in football. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-293530" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/nike-football.ashx_.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/nike-football.ashx_.jpg 620w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/nike-football.ashx_-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /> “We will just take it. I think it’s time the system is looked at because it’s painting a bad picture of the game. We are heartbroken, but we need to move on and focus on the next game.” Results Indlovu Iyanyathela 0-1 Ciwu, Hwange 1-0 Arenel, ZPC Hwange 3-0 Mainline, Bosso 90 3-4 Zim Saints, Quality Foods 3- Indosakusa, Emakhandeni 0-3 Talen Vision, Mountain Climbers 3-1 Casmyn, Ajax 1-0 Binga Pirates -@innocentskizoe
