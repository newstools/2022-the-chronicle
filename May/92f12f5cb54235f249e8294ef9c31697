THE Government is working on a raft of changes to legislation governing radiation and protection issues. The move is in line with international standards that will build the Government’s capacity to deal with related challenges. The Radiation and Protection Authority of Zimbabwe (RPAZ) corporate communications officer, Mr Shingirai Huni confirmed the developments yesterday. <img class="wp-image-611547 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-15-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Radiation and Protection Authority of Zimbabwe (RPAZ) He said the proposed changes will enable the Government to fulfil its obligations arising from international treaties relating to nuclear safety and security to which Zimbabwe is a party. The Bill has since been sent to the Cabinet for approval. Mr Huni said the country was encountering a litany of challenges in fulfilling its mandate under the existing Radiation and Protection act Chapter 15:15. “The draft bill is in place and approval has been obtained from the Attorney General’s office and has been referred for consideration by the Cabinet. “In fact, the bill is at an advanced stage for promulgation, maybe it will take effect by end of the year,” he said. The official said there were challenges in handling civil penalties and the legislation would look at introducing levy penalties for those violating set regulations. Mr Huni said among other things, the amendments will enhance a regulatory control for ionising and non-ionising radiation, with the latter being introduced for the first time as it was not provided for under the existing Act. He said under the new order, the authority will be able to fully manage disused sources and radioactive waste and prepare for emergencies and responses to nuclear incidents and accidents.  “It is our hope that the refined legislation will help us to create a system for the administration of safeguards and improve coordination of nuclear security. It is critical that we have a system for the control of import and export of radioactive sources and equipment and the transportation of radioactive materials,” said Mr Huni. He said recently RPAZ noted an increase in compliance from monitored facilities, although it was generally low in those facilities under the Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) category. Mr Huni said RPAZ expected to train more people and continuously engage with multi-stakeholders to reduce the effects of radiation. He said the authority had intensified enforcement initiatives against violators of radiation protection laws in the form of conditions to maintain a licence, legal action, and prohibition to use of radiation-emitting equipment. “We have also taken into account issues of radioactivity and safety at the ports of entry and exit, where the baggage and commercial scanners are used. To that effect, the authority has put in place a deliberate action plan to raise awareness on radiation safety for specific groups, and this has been prioritised for agencies with some level of responsibility for safety such as customs, the ZRP, the security sector, associations representing workers, the public and authorised organisations,” he said. <img class="wp-image-611550 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) The official said RPAZ had established a training school to spearhead awareness campaigns. At the ports of entry and exit, Mr Huni said, priority has been towards ensuring adequate safety through compliance assurance inspections, training, and awareness of key personnel and organisations. “Awareness of the public is through adequate signage and notices and procedural interventions where necessary by the authorised parties,” he added. –@tupeyo
