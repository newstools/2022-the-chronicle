ZNKF said the final training camp will be held at Queens Sports Club in Kwekwe on Saturday. “We are inviting members of provincial squads that have been selected by their respective technical directors to this last national team selection before the games. Only athletes who participated and excelled in at least one of the last three tournaments, the 2022 Japanese Ambassador’s Karate Tournament, the Kurai Open Invitation and the just ended Clash of the Titans, will be eligible for national team selection,” ZNKF said.
