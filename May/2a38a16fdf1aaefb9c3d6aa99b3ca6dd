SEVERAL(IPPs) projects stalled in the past two years largely due to Covid-19 effects as shipment of equipment halted while foreign currency challenges heightened the challenges, the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has said. While more than 100 IPPs have been licensed in the last few years, only a handful of projects have been implemented and are generating low output. <img class="size-full wp-image-606255" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-39-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Independent power producers The Government expects IPPs to produce about 2 000MW by 2030 as part of the Second Republic’s grand vision of an upper middle-income society where electricity, among other services, should be readily available and accessible to all citizens. Zera communications officer, Mrs Lindiwe Nyoni, said the authority was engaging the contractors to ensure progress. “In the past two years, there have been challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Importation of most equipment used stalled,” she said in a recent interview in Bulawayo. <img class="size-full wp-image-606258" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Lindiwe Nyoni “Also, the shipment of equipment already bought was halted. The issue of foreign currency has also been singled out as a challenge. “So, the two-year phase greatly affected most projects. As an authority, it is within our mandate to engage IPPs and help them overcome challenges.” In the past, IPPs called on Government to ring-fence foreign currency specifically targeting them for timeous implementation of projects. Meanwhile, Zera has embarked on an upgrade of all service stations, grouping them into three categories to improve customer efficiency. Fillings stations would be grouped into one star, three stars and five stars.  “We have begun upgrading service stations mainly focusing on what customers get besides fuel. Under one star, customers have access to fuel and safety at the station,” said Mrs Nyoni. “For those stations on level 3, besides fuel, ablution facilities and convenient stores are also available. Over and above fuel, ablution facilities, under five star customers have access to free pressure, cash wash and a range of other services.” Mrs Nyoni said the levels offer customers a broad choice of which service stations they want to engage with. — @nqobilebhebhe
