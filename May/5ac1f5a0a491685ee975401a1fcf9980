The construction of the dam will transform Matabeleland region as irrigation projects will be established along the pipeline thereby turning the region into a green belt and will provide a permanent solution to Bulawayo’s water shortages. Government has identified irrigable land covering 10 000 hectares along the pipeline. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607438" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-20-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lake Gwayi-Shangani is part of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project, an idea which was conceived more than a century ago and has only been turned into reality by the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa. Two weeks ago, the country started receiving pipes from South Africa for the 245km pipeline that will bring water from the dam to Bulawayo. The dam wall is now 68 percent complete with Government expressing satisfaction with construction works being undertaken. <img class="wp-image-581524 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-34-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-34-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-34-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka recently said the century old dream of bringing water to Bulawayo is becoming a reality under President Mnangagwa’s administration.

He said it was important to meet the set deadlines given the fact that the project had dragged on for a very long time. “The target has been to complete the dam construction by the end of June. The fact that they are now working day and night is important considering that at some stage the progress was stalled due to shortage of materials. Now that all the material is on site it is necessary to ensure all works are completed so that the dam starts benefiting the people,” said Minister Moyo. He said the delivery of pipes that will bring water from Lake Gwayi Shangani to Bulawayo confirms Government’s commitment to complete the project meant to solve Bulawayo’s water shortages while also transforming the people’s lives in Matabeleland North and Bulawayo. “We want to express gratitude to President Mnangagwa and the Second Republic because he is the one who made all the efforts to ensure this project is completed. The pipes have started arriving, we are confident that Bulawayo will soon start receiving water from Gwayi-Shangani. In Matabeleland, we will also benefit through irrigation projects,” said Minister Moyo. <img class="wp-image-566155 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Cde-Kidwell-Mujuru.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Cde-Kidwell-Mujuru.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Cde-Kidwell-Mujuru-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo’s Cowdray Park councillor Cde Kidwell Mujuru Bulawayo’s Cowdray Park councillor Cde Kidwell Mujuru said the laying of the pipeline is also expected to create employment for lcoals. In Cowdray, a water reservoir will be built where water will be pumped in before being distributed to different parts of the city. “We expect that 100 jobs will be created for the locals during the laying of the pipeline. This project will therefore contribute to socio-economic development of this area and beyond.  The biggest benefit however will be solving the perennial water problems for Bulawayo. We are thankful to President Mnangagwa’s Government for delivering on this important project. We are very happy that the New Dispensation has addressed this problem which successive governments before it failed to solve,” said Cde Mujuru. -@nqotshili
