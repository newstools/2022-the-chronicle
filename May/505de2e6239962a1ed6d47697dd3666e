They could win the title on Tuesday if Liverpool lose at Southampton. “It’s in our hands, that’s good,” Guardiola said. “It would have been perfect to win today but West Ham is fighting for Europa League and have had an incredible season. It’s so complicated to attack them and play against them, so difficult.” West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen struck twice in the first half but Jack Grealish pulled one back for City early in the second before Vladimir Coufal scored an own goal. <img class="size-full wp-image-609165" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Westham-vs-Mancity-match.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Westham-vs-Mancity-match.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Westham-vs-Mancity-match-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: Reuters It was the first time City bounced back from two goals down in a top-flight game since 2012. “A great comeback,” Guardiola said. “I think we played a really good game. They (West Ham) are so good in the transitions. “But we spoke at half-time, ‘Don’t give up. Score one goal and we’ll be in the game’. Fortunately, we scored earlier in the second half and afterwards, we had one chance . . . fair result.”  City could secure their fourth title in five seasons if they beat Villa. “It won’t be easy, there will be a lot of emotions. We have to train, be calm and arrive fresh. We have one week and will do everything in that game to win the title,” Guardiola said. — SuperSport
