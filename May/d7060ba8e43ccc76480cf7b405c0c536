A JOURNEY that started off during his internship has landed Denzil Mnkandla (33) one of the top football administration jobs in the country. Mnkandla was earlier this week appointed Castle Lager Premier Soccer League defending champions FC Platinum’s new general manager. He takes over the position left vacant by the retirement of Joseph Mususa at the beginning of the year. Since Mususa’s retirement, Mnkandla has been the club’s acting general manager. Mnkandla’s appointment comes a coupleof months after Highlanders also appointed a young chief executive officer Ronald Moyo (32) to run the day-to-day affairs of the club. <img class="size-full wp-image-596391" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ronald-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ronald-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ronald-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ronald Moyo “It’s a really humbling feeling knowing that people at the club believe in my ability to hold such a post. I guess it is a testament to their faith in my capabilities, which I greatly appreciate. It is such an awesome opportunity for me and is a huge motivation for me to keep working hard,” said Mnkandla. “I was born in Bulawayo in 1989, attended Maphisa Primary School in Sizinda (Grade 1-5) and Hugh Beadle Primary School in Sauerstown (Grade 6-7). I then attended Marist Brothers Secondary School in Dete (Form 1-4) and then Christian Brothers College in Bulawayo for my A-Levels. “I studied at NUST (2012-2016) and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Sports Science. I have a qualification in match analysis (attained in 2017) with STATS, a Zifa Sports Administration certificate and a Zifa Level 1 coaching certificate,” he said. He says his rise at FC Platinum started during his internship. <img class="size-full wp-image-602584" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-59-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-59-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-59-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nust “I was actually attached at FC Platinum in 2015 during my degree programme and I was recalled after I finished my final-year in 2016. Apart from the Covid-19 pandemic stopping sporting activities for over a year, it has been great. I had a great mentor in Mr Joseph Mususa, my predecessor, whom I learnt a lot from and worked with closely when I came in as the club’s administrative assistant in 2016. “Everyone in the club executive was also available to assist and teach me all the systems that make the club function on a professional level. Obviously, there was and still is a lot for me to learn, but I feel it has been a great learning experience thus far.” Mnkandla said his objectives are aligned to the club’s vision, which is to be a leading self-sustaining global football brand and make an effort to make it a reality whether he remains at the club or not.  “Everything starts with a single step and I feel the club has already made great strides in competitions locally and regionally. As a club that has existed for 27 years this year, I feel it has made an impact on the football landscape in Africa in the past five years and that is great for us. The club has won three league titles, while I have been around so those same standards that made us champions are still there and I also have to ensure they are upheld. “As long as we keep the standards as high as they have always been, then I know the club will be going in the right direction. The values of the club always ensure there is a standard in how we operate, which are professionalism, excellence, passion and teamwork,” Mnkandla said. — @innocentskizoe
