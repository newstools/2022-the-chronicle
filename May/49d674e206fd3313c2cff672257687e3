The song was written by myself, performed, and sung by Iyasa. It was produced by  Oskid while the video was done by Keaitse Films. “The video has very interesting scenery from Bulawayo’s oldest suburb Makokoba and a part of Mzilikazi. “This is a song that we hope will do well as it chronicles memories of our city and Africa in general through a vintage flashback of our lifestyles,” Dube said. He went on to express gratitude for the bookings they have been receiving locally which have seen them working with the country’s First Family. “We’ve been going around the country with the First Lady Dr Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa courtesy of the National Aids Council in support of her Male Engagement programme campaign against GBV,” said Dube. — @mthabisi_mthire
