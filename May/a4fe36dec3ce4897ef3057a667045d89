The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter LAST week, African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (Aripo) joined the rest of the world in celebrating World Intellectual Property Day. The celebrations were held under the theme, “IP and Youth: Innovating for a Better Future.” Aripo communications associate Chengetai Nyagweta confirmed Aripo’s commitment to working closely with creatives and content creators so as to retain knowledge. “As Aripo, we are here to avail and increase knowledge on intellectual property which we feel is a gap that has remained unfilled for quite a while as people have sketchy ideas on what they are and how they work. Intellectual Property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, and symbols used in both the creative and commercial industry. We are committed to teaching them the ins and outs,” Nyagweta said. The expert intellectual property practitioners work closely with the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (ZIMURA) to help artistes benefit from their craft. – @eMKlass_49
