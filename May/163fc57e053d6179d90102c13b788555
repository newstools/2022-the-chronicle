Nepal won by nine points  ZIMBABWE A had a day to forget on the park in the second one-day match against Nepal at Kirtipur on Saturday after being bowled out for 87 to lose by nine wickets. The tourists were put in to bat when they lost the toss, and disaster began from the first ball when Innocent Kaia was caught off the bowling of Karan KC. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606991" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-13-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tadiwanashe Marumani was next out with 15 on the board in the fourth over when he was caught at the wicket off Sompal Kami. Cephas Zhuwao hit a six and a four, but struggled to score, managing 10 runs off 13 balls before being caught. Wickets continued to tumble, with Roy Kaia going for four, Clive Madande for one and Tony Munyonga for two, as the score reached 30 for six in the 12th over.  There was something of a stand when Jonathan Campbell and Luke Jongwe fought back and more than doubled the score. Disaster, however, struck again at 65 in the 23rd over when Jongwe was bowled by Sagar Dhakal for eight and Campbell was run out for 27 in the next delivery. Zimbabwe A plunged to 66 for nine wickets, as Brandon Mavuta was out lbw to Sandeep Lamichhane for one. Fortunately, the tailenders fought back, with Victor Nyauchi playing a defensive game while Brad Evans went for his strokes whenever he could by judging well which balls to hit. <img class="size-full wp-image-606223" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tadiwanashe-Marumani.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tadiwanashe-Marumani.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tadiwanashe-Marumani-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tadiwanashe Marumani He scored an unbeaten 20 off 35 balls, with a six and a four, while Nyauchi was stumped for a duck after facing 17 deliveries.
