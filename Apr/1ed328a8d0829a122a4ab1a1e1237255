The Chronicle FIFA is to launch the Fifa Legal Portal, an online platform through which proceedings before the Fifa Football Tribunal and Fifa judicial bodies will be conducted as of May 1. The portal will enable football stakeholders such as clubs, players, associations, intermediaries, law firms with a power of attorney, and anyone involved in proceedings to lodge a claim with the relevant Fifa decision-making or judicial body and will gradually replace the current system of communication by email. While the proceedings will still be governed by the respective Fifa regulations, the notification of communications, submissions, decisions and other documents will be handled through the Fifa Legal Portal, which aims to ensure simple, secure and transparent communication between Fifa and the parties involved, as well as a better understanding of the proceedings and heightened traceability.  Fifa also said the new platform will offer the possibility for users to “report conduct considered incompatible with the Fifa regulations”. This is in addition to the existing whistle-blower platform. A user manual providing further information and a step-by-step guide to the Fifa Legal Portal will be available on Fifa.com. A statement said: “Fifa is continuing to modernise and streamline the proceedings before its decision-making and judicial bodies in order to facilitate the filing and management of claims, while at the same time ensuring the transparency and traceability of proceedings for all football stakeholders.” Fifa said it was encouraging stakeholders to register on the Fifa Legal Portal from May 1 at legalportal.fifa.com. – Global Football Legal
