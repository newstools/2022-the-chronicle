THE Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) is set to host a two-day 3-on-3 tournament at Khanyisile Sports Centre this coming weekend. The games are scheduled for this Saturday and Sunday. The 3-on-3 basketball is a new version of the game played by three players a-side and scoring in one basketball hoop. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599910" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-15-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-15-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-15-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Each game is 15 minutes long or ends when one team reaches 21 points, whichever comes first. The discipline recently became an Olympic sport and was adopted by the African Games. BBA 3-on-3 president Tracy Phiri says registration for the competition is now open. “Registration for participating teams is US$10. “The concept to have this 3-on-3 competition came after we noted that the  International Basketball Federation (FIBA) is moving towards introducing the 3-on-3 format of the game, which  is seen to be more fun than the traditional 5-on-5.  “We’ve been playing social games as we introduce this version of the game. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-448593" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/3-on-3-basketball-tournament.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/3-on-3-basketball-tournament.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/3-on-3-basketball-tournament-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We decided to have this competition and hopefully we will see more of these competitions,” said Phiri. BBA had planned a number of 3-on-3 tournaments last year, but the events were affected by lockdown restrictions announced by the Government then. The planned tournament was aimed at marking the return of basketball action in the country. Last year the game suffered a blow when Bulawayo failed to host the Africa 3×3 basketball tournament in December due to lockdown restrictions after Zimbabwe had confirmed participation in the tournament. — @innocentskizoe
