BARELY a year after getting his first coaching job at Zambian lower league side MC Galaxy Football Academy, Zimbabwean Zimiseleni Moyo has made a giant step in his career by joining one of that country’s top talent producers, Shamuel Academy. Moyo was head-hunted out of his MC Galaxy contract by Lusaka-based Shamuel Academy, who are in the First Division. The 37-year-old Moyo, who was forced into retirement at the beginning of 2021 due to nagging tendon and ankle pains, enjoyed more success in Zambia than in Zimbabwe, winning multiple championships with Zesco United from Ndola and also had a good run with former Zambian champions Zanaco from Lusaka. <img class="size-full wp-image-603810" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zambian-gaffer-Fewdays-Musonda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zambian-gaffer-Fewdays-Musonda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zambian-gaffer-Fewdays-Musonda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zambian gaffer Fewdays Musonda The dreadlocked former Tsholotsho FC, Motor Action and Railstars player said the offer by Shamuel Academy came as a shock since the Lusaka club, previously coached by renowned Zambian gaffer Fewdays Musonda, can afford experienced trainers from the Zambian Premiership. In an interview from his Lusaka base, an elated Moyo said his mandate is to improve the team’s position on the log. “I’ve been engaged by a Division One side, Shamuel Academy that is well sponsored and it’s one of the biggest producers of talent in Zambia. To me, this is good progress considering that this deal comes less than a year into my first coaching job. This is quite a big step to get an offer from a team that can get any good coach, even those from the Premiership. “I’ve been engaged on an interim deal to finish the season. Presently, we are in position 10 and we’re left with five games and the season is ending in May. The target is to improve the position of the team, but most importantly, they got me because as one of Zambia’s finest talent producers, they were enticed by the quality of football that MC Galaxy was displaying. With the resources that Shamuel Academy has, I think that’s why they want that brand of football where players express themselves and at the same time playing quality football,” said Moyo. The Pumula North-bred footie star turned coach, said coaching four-year-olds up to Under-12 players at MC Galaxy had helped shape his career. “Besides coaching the senior team at MC Galaxy, I was involved with juniors and that’s where one needs to apply coaching skills as the coaching involves teaching basic football techniques. <img class="size-full wp-image-603814" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zimiseleni-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zimiseleni-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zimiseleni-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimiseleni Moyo at a match a few years back So you find that it helps you grow as a coach while you’re laying the foundation for the players, meaning you address everything that is meant to empower players. I learnt to absorb pressure and how to get the best out of players. It was a privilege to coach MC Galaxy right after retirement,” said Moyo. “When you are a player, you don’t have much pressure, it’s just your performance alone that gets you going. Even if the group is not doing well, but individually you are doing well there’s no pressure on you, but as a coach you’re trying to get the best out of everyone at the same time. As a coach you have to strike a balance with those unhappy faces not playing so that everyone feels they’re contributing something to the team.” Moyo said his transition from a player to coaching was smooth because of the help he got from MC Galaxy.  “I started as an assistant before being elevated to head coach and that helped me to learn and understand my responsibilities as well as appreciate the pressure of being a coach. By the time I was appointed head coach, I already knew what the game demands as a coach. At least now that mentality of being a footballer is clearing off as my focus now is to get the best out of the team,” said Moyo. – @ZililoR
