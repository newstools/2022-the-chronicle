The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter FARMING of roundnuts (Indlubu/nyimo) at a commercial scale has transformed livelihoods for communal farmers in some districts in the Matabeleland and Midlands provinces, a departure from the past when traditional grains were grown only for consumption. <img class="wp-image-603982 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/155-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/155-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/155-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> roundnuts (Indlubu/nyimo) Communal farmers in Bubi in Matabeleland North, Umzingwane in Matabeleland South, Gokwe South in Midlands and Chivi in Masvingo have partnered some local companies which they supply with indlubu which are then commercialised. For most people it might not even be imaginable that Indlubu can be processed and canned but these local products are being value added and exported to regional and international markets. As companies value add indlubu/nyimo they buy from local farmers, communities are also transformed. <img class="alignnone wp-image-603987 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/1667.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/1667.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/1667-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Onesimo Tinova, a communal farmer from Gokwe had never imagined that his life could be turned around through growing indlubu/nyimo, a crop he has always produced at his homestead. But his fortunes transformed when he participated in an out-grower scheme for local companies that process these crops. Mr Tinova is among scores of members of the public exhibiting at 62nd edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair running under them: ‘Re-think, Re-imagine, Re-invent Value Chains for Economic Development’ as he represents some of the out-grower farmers. He said since participating in the scheme in 2019, he has managed to buy a grinding mill and cattle.“We have been assisted a lot as farmers because when we started cropping indlubu it was only for consumption purposes. We had no reasons to scale up production but we are now connected to the markets and we are now growing it for commercial purposes. This project started in 2019, that is when we started to do it for commercial purposes. I have managed to buy four cattle and a grinding mill through growing round nuts.”  <img class="wp-image-574559 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-24-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-24-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Untitled-24-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Communal Farmers Mr Tinova said communal farmers have also gained a lot of knowledge from the implementing partners. “Through the partnership, we have learnt how to professionalise farming. We now keep records so that you understand where you are going and where you are coming from. It makes business more viable,” said Mr Tinova. The farmers have partnered private sector and NGOs to connect them to markets as well increasing their yields under the Zimbabwe Economic Partnership Agreement. <img class="alignnone wp-image-524115 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Farmers1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Farmers1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Farmers1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Strengthening Competitiveness and Potential for Export of Inclusive Value Chains Project in Zimbabwe (SCOPE4IVC) head of project Mr Minenhle Ngwenya who is in charge of the implementation of the project said the advantage of the project is that farmers connect to markets they previously could not access. “We are working in four districts spread across four provinces in the country. We have Gokwe South in Midlands, Bubi in Matabeleland North, Umzingwane in Matabeleland South and Chivi in Masvingo. “What are we doing there? We are supporting three value chains that we consider to be inclusive value chains. When we say inclusive, this is a value chain typically that if you were supporting a commodity or a product it will enlist the participation of a rural smallholder farmer,” said Mr Ngwenya. “The ordinary farmer benefits in local production and marketing. I would like them to tell their story but I should highlight that they have been producing these products. But prior to these partnerships they would not get the opportunity to get equipped to produce for commercial purposes. “There is the aspect of market linkages, these companies are not producing anything but are buying from the farmers, that is an opportunity that is there. Hopefully they are making money out of this and improving their livelihoods.”  He said apart from indlubu they were also doing value addition on the marula (amaganu) and chillies. “What we do is we organise small holder farmers into functional groups so that they can commercially produce and market their produce with special attributes towards accessing food markets.” Some of the value-added goods were also being exhibited at ZITF while some of the companies that buy from them were also participating showing the benefits of the value chain scheme. –@nqotshili
