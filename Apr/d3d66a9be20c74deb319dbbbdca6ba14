THERE is a strong possibility that there will be no semi-finals for the ZITF Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile, as only a few athletes have managed to qualify for the semis to date. The ZITF Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile is an annual men’s competition with a pre-requisite time of four minutes 31 seconds for one to qualify for the final at the ZITF main arena. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603447" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-48-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Traditionally, the semi-finals are used to screen the final 20 men that will participate in the final, but as it stands, only 11 athletes have qualified for the semi-finals, meaning these could be heading straight into the final. Bulawayo Athletics Board chairperson Watson Madanyika expressed concern over the increased number of athletes failing to make the grade. “The biggest challenge is that athletes have struggled to qualify. To date, only 11 have managed to book slots in the semi-finals. If we have less than 20 athletes qualifying, there will be no semi-finals. “Normally we have so many athletes making the semis, but that has not been the case this year.  I believe it has to do with the Covid-19 enforced breaks. I feel maybe some of the athletes were not training, which is why they are finding it difficult to qualify. We will be holding qualifiers up to Thursday as we seek to iincrease the number of athletes taking part,” Madanyika said. Collins Khanye, Wellington Vareni, Tapiwa Chineka, Nyasha Mutsetse, Levison Mapfuwa, Humpery Kunaka, Elija Mabhunu, Bornface Jeki, Nomore Wiriki, Godwin Katakura and Trust Hove are the runners that have qualified for the semis. <img class="wp-image-603454 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-50-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-50-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-50-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tapiwa Chineka  A cash prize of $112 000 awaits the winner of the race while $56 000 is in store for the first runner-up and $49 000 for the second runner-up.
