The fiesta was mooted by Bulilima West legislator and Deputy Minister of Information Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Dingumuzi Phuti to provide an interactive platform for youths to share ideas on how to push back the frontiers of poverty and spearhead development in their communities. <img class="wp-image-598567 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Minister-Dingumuzi-Phuti.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Minister-Dingumuzi-Phuti.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Minister-Dingumuzi-Phuti-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Dingumuzi Phuti Macingwane, Zimnyama, Dombolefu, Dombodema, Vulindlela, Malanswazi, Hingwe, Bambadzi, Ndolwane, Makhulela, Madlambudzi, Masendu and Nyele’s select teams battled it out in the competition that was won by Malanswazi.

The event was also a gesture to thank the people of Bulilima West for voting for me and His Excellency President Mnangagwa on appointing me as Deputy Minister of Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services,” he said. — @innocentskizoe
