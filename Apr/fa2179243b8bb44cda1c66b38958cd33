RAPPER Tojey Blox is excited at the prospect of bagging his first Mzansi Arts and Media Awards (Mama) gong as his Amapiano song SBWL iGoodlife has gotten recognition. Will the third time be the charm for the Power singer who has come short twice in the South African awards ceremony? <img class="wp-image-574612 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Tojey-Blox.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Tojey-Blox.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Tojey-Blox-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tojey Blox The Mamas serve as a platform to uplift up-and-coming artistes and creatives in South Africa and Tojey Blox has been a mainstay in the awards since their inception three years ago. In recent years, the artiste has been nominated for Best Upcoming Artiste as well as Best Hip-Hop Artiste and he thinks his recent nomination under the Best Amapiano artiste will be his best shot. Tojey Blox told Chronicle Showbiz that he feels the time is right for him to win his first Mama gong. “I feel like it’s about time I won my first Mama. In the last two editions, I came short, but I believe that with SBWL iGoodlife, I stand a chance to win. It won’t be easy, but I fancy my chances,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-603369" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/American-artiste-Ne-Yo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/American-artiste-Ne-Yo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/American-artiste-Ne-Yo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> American artiste Ne-Yo The Njube-based rapper started off the year flying high as he also scored a cameo role in local drama series, Love Lies. On Saturday, he curtain-raised for South African rapper Gigi Lamayne at the Fiva Fest that was held at The Boundary. Tojey Blox said meeting Gigi Lamayne was an honour he will not forget. “I finally met Gigi Lamayne, one of the best female rappers in South Africa. It was an honour meeting her and sharing the same stage with her. I’ll never forget the experience as she’s humble and easy to interact with,” said Tojey Blox.  Tojey Blox rose to fame with his “soon-coming” collaboration with American artiste Ne-Yo and widespread endorsements from South African creatives, among them actress Dawn Thandeka King who played MaNgcobo in popular soapie Uzalo as well as rapper MarazA. – @eMKlass_49
