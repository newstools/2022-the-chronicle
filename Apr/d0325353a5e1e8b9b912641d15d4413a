Villagers suspect that the attacker could be a 35-year-old who is wanted by Plumtree police for attempted murder among other crimes. The suspect attacked two women in January at nearby Mbila village and left them for dead and police are yet to bring him to book. Another murder suspect from Gwambe village, Godknows Moyo (37) who killed his father in February is yet to be accounted for. This has caused fear in the communities that the suspects could be hiding somewhere and committing crime under cover of darkness. <img class="wp-image-604228 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/MPILO-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/MPILO-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/MPILO-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mpilo Central Hospital Mrs Moyo was discovered on Saturday morning by neighbours who rushed her to Plumtree District hospital where she was admitted for a night before being transferred to Mpilo Central Hospital on Sunday morning. Award winning poet, Sithembile Zingizwani Izinja Siqhoza who is a neighbour to the lady said the community is in shock over the incident.“I went to her homestead on Saturday morning to charge my phone as she has electricity at her homestead. “When I got there her minor grandchildren told me that they had last seen her following her herd boy to assist him with penning cattle but did not return. Her neighbours assumed she had come back during the night and went out again in the morning to search for some of the cattle. “While still deliberating on the issue a boy came running to inform us that MaTshuma had been attacked and was lying lifeless in the bush. When we got there we found people gathered around her. They had a plastic bag with blood drenched soil. Transport was organised to ferry her to Plumtree District Hospital,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-466305 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/attempted-murder.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/attempted-murder.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/attempted-murder-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Siqhoza said when they got to the hospital they were told to report to the police first before being attended at the hospital. She said after police wrote them a letter they waited for four hours at the hospital before they could get service. “She has about four wounds that could have been caused by an axe on the head and the condition we found her in was not pleasing. She tried to walk but fell three times. There is need for such cases to be treated with the urgency that they deserve. It took time for her to be attended to at Plumtree Hospital and the process to transfer her to Bulawayo also did not match her condition. Even when they got to Mpilo it was around 5pm but she was only attended to at 9pm,” she said. A villager Mr John Ndlovu urged police to up their game and bring the attackers to book before more people fall victim. “The community is living in fear as people have been attacked and killed in neighbouring villages and now it has happened to us. The situation is getting out of hand and we urge the police to act before more people are killed,” he said. Caretaker councillor for Bulilima ward one, Melusi Nkomo said he was yet to get a report of the latest incident.  “Matabeleland South assistant police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Philisani Moyo confirmed the case and said investigations are in progress. He said members of public with information which could help bring the culprits to book should contact the police.– @themkhust
