The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter EVERYTHING is in place for the hosting of a show dubbed Mama’s Big Grownish which is a one man show by comedian MaForty. The Bulawayo based rib cracker started off the show in the capital on April 2 and the City of Kings will play host on Friday at Zimbabwe Music Academy (ZMA) as from 6.30pm. The one-man show in the city will be the sixth for the comical man who is on a mission to grow his brand. Said MaForty: “All is set for the show and l am happy that my mom flew into the country and is set to attend the show alongside my young sisters. “We had a good response on the script in Harare thus we will be just adding and subtracting here and there,” said MaForty. -@mthabisi_mthire
