The Chronicle England will face the United States, Iran, and either Scotland, Wales or Ukraine in the group stages of the 2022 Qatar World Cup later this year as they were handed a dream draw on Friday. Gareth Southgate’s side will be looking to end 56 years of hurt when they head to the Gulf state this  winter. The Three Lions moved into second favourites with bookmakers behind Brazil after the draw and will play in the group stages between November 21 and December 2 and will play their first match – against Iran – on the opening day of the tournament.  After being drawn in Group B they will face either hosts Qatar, Ecuador, Senegal or Holland (Group A) in the last 16. England are on the same side of the draw as France and so could face the world champions in the quarter-finals should they win their respective groups. They could then come up against Belgium or Portugal in the semi-finals followed by Spain, Germany or Brazil in the final. – dailymailoneline
