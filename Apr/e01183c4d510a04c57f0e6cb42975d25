The Chronicle LEGENDARY Premier Soccer League striker Wilfred “Silver Fox” Mugeyi remains unconvinced that Peter Shalulile will surpass the elusive 20-goal mark this season.  Shalulile is currently the leading goalscorer in the DStv Premiership with 15 goals, followed by the likes of Royal AM’s Victor Letsoalo on 13 goals. According to Mugeyi, who holds the record of being the first-ever recipient of the Premier Soccer League Golden Boot Award, Shalulile will just miss out on the 20-goal mark. “I doubt very much that anyone will reach 20 goals this season, probably 18,” Mugeyi told KickOff. “Seven games is too few games to score five goals. If they could only score 15 goals out of 23 matches well, I think seven is not enough. I don’t think there’s anyone who can score five goals in seven matches, I doubt that. “Looking from the outside it’s easy to say that five goals are nothing, you’d be surprised that out of these seven games they will probably score only one or two goals. This time of the season there are teams that are fighting relegation, teams are fighting to get into the top eight. Teams are fighting to win the championship, so it’s going to be very tough. “You will find that the teams that are fighting relegation if they score then sit back and close shop. So, it’s going to be difficult to score. As for the award, I think Shalulile will win it though, the way Sundowns play he’s got very good players around him.” – KickOff
