THE artistic flair of people with roots in Zimbabwe is undoubted and day in and out, their skill is discovered, not only locally, but on regional and international platforms.  From Luthuli Dlamini, Chiedza Mhende, Leroy Gopal, Sha Sha, DJ Zandimaz, Nadia Nakai and Oskido, the list is endless. Another individual who has joined the bandwagon is 29-year-old Mluleki Moyo who is part of the DiepCity cast. <img class="size-full wp-image-527924" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/zandimaz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/zandimaz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/zandimaz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Zandimaz The South African telenovela explores the struggle of four young women who were forced into crime while in high school just to make ends meet as they try to make their way in the world. Moyo, who is known as McGeorge in the creative sector, plays the role of Humble, brother to Pastor Charleston (real name Chrispen Nyathi) who is coincidentally also a Zimbabwean. Chronicle Showbiz recently tracked him down to get to know more about him. <img class="size-full wp-image-602838" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/dj-oskido.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/dj-oskido.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/dj-oskido-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Oskido McGeorge is not only an actor by profession, but is a versatile person with a focus on music, stand-up comedy and MCeeing. He made his acting debut through the series which has caught the attention of many in the African film industry. Born in South Africa, the artiste has roots in the country as his parents are natives of the beautiful nation, particularly, the country’s cultural hub – Bulawayo. “Although I was born in South Africa, I’m a Zimbabwean by descent as my parents are from Zimbabwe. My family resides in Burnside, Bulawayo. I was born on May 16, 1993, in South Africa and moved to Tanzania in 2003 to stay with my aunt after the passing of my parents. “I then went to Zimbabwe in 2005 where I did my Grade 7 at Milton Junior School in Bulawayo in 2006 before returning to South Africa to further my studies in 2007,” said McGeorge. <img class="size-full wp-image-602844" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Milton-Junior-School.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Milton-Junior-School.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Milton-Junior-School-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Milton Junior School He said he developed a passion for acting at a tender age. “Ever since I was five years old, it was my wish to appear on television. I used to mimic actors and my family enjoyed the performances. I was hyperactive and used to give them a lot of problems as a kid,” said McGeorge as he chuckled. His breakthrough in the acting industry, McGeorge said, did not come on a silver platter as sweat and determination have been the order of the day. “Although my family didn’t have enough funds to take me to school to study drama, I made it a point that my dream came true despite my background. There were times when I knocked on TV doors and they’d be shut in my face, but I never gave up as I kept pushing and believing in myself.” He said he finally got his breakthrough last year when he landed a role on DiepCity, one of the most-watched soapies on Mzansi Magic. <img class="size-full wp-image-602848" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/diep-city.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/diep-city.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/diep-city-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DiepCity “I joined DiepCity in its first season, early 2021 as Humble, Charleston’s brother who is a fake pastor. I got the role from posting monologues on Instagram and got to audition on an Instagram live setup with the director Mandla N. They liked the performance and I was called two weeks later to join the cast. “My journey on the show has been awesome as I’ve gotten a lot of recognition in the industry,” said McGeorge while urging people to expect a very tricky pastor who never ceases to disappoint his brother Charleston. Giving advice to his fellow countrymen who hope to flourish in the arts industry, McGeorge said: “They need to push as much as they can as it can only get better with the work they put in. Focus and dedication are key.” He added that the industry in South Africa is vast and open to all creatives willing to put out their work. Turning to his musical career, McGeorge said he started recording in 2016. <img class="size-full wp-image-602857" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mluleki-‘McGeorge’-Moyo-1-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mluleki-‘McGeorge’-Moyo-1-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mluleki-‘McGeorge’-Moyo-1--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mluleki ‘McGeorge’ Moyo “I started recording music in 2016 and stopped due to lack of resources and exposure. However, I resumed last year and I’ll soon be releasing new music as I’m working on an Amapiano single titled Shosholoza. I featured a South African artiste called King Monopoly. “I’m still finding my feet in the music industry though, but I’m doing all that I can to ensure that I flourish.” He said stand-up comedy is his oldest creative profession which dates back to 2018. “I’ve been doing stand-up comedy since 2018. I’ve performed with the likes of Chik Aljoy, George Kuda and Bexta Ndabalime who are all from Zimbabwe. I’ve also performed for Funnyness and the Funny Company at Shakers Extreme, Maboneng. <img class="size-full wp-image-602853" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chik-Aljoy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chik-Aljoy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chik-Aljoy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chik Aljoy “I’ve always been the funny guy around people so comedy came naturally. I was inspired by a lot of comedians around the globe and Mceeing comes from my love for music and being around the music space,” said McGeorge. Going forward, he said people can expect to see him on more shows and series and hear him on radio as well. “There’s a lot to expect from me so people must lookout as there’re more exciting things that I’ll be doing.” – @mthabisi_mthire
