ABOUT 50 000 children in the 12 to 15 years’ age group in Matabeleland South Province received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in the last two weeks as part of the ongoing national vaccination blitz targeting learners.  Government approved the vaccination of this age group with the Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O) vaccine. The ongoing upgraded Covid-19 vaccination blitz was launched by Vice-President and Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Constantino Chiwenga on March 20. Government has confirmed that the country has enough vaccine stocks for the planned national vaccination blitz having received 22 405 000 Covid-19 vaccine doses and utilised 8 758 655 so far. Matabeleland South provincial medical director Dr Rudo Chikodzore said the province had seen a marked increase in numbers of people vaccinated since the national vaccination blitz started on March 20. “Matabeleland South province has started to implement the Government policy which allows vaccination of schoolgoing children in the age group 12 to 15. The uptake of vaccines in this age group has been good so far. We have vaccinated about 50 000 people in this age group in the past two weeks. We are conducting an accelerated vaccination programme across the province where people can access Covid-19 vaccination services at all health facilities and various outreach points,” said Dr Chikodzore. “We would like to urge all individuals who have not been vaccinated or are due for the second or third dose to take advantage of this exercise to be vaccinated.” The Ministry of Health and Child Care said the Sinovac shot is the only vaccine eligible for use on teenagers and minors. — @Yolisswa
