OVER 55 percent of targeted learners aged 12-15 in Bulawayo have been vaccinated against Covid-19 during the national vaccination blitz.  With 62 teams manning 23 static stations and 153 schools since the launch of the programme two weeks ago, 35 766 learners have been inoculated. Bulawayo is targeting to vaccinate 64 588 learners aged 12-15 during the blitz. The province also had a target to vaccinate 28 255 learners aged 16-18 and so far 16 percent have received their first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Statistics from the Ministry of Health and Child Care show that as of Tuesday, Zimbabwe had 246 744 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 239 055 recoveries and 5 451 deaths. To date, a total of 5 585 115 people have received their first dose, 3 569 933 their second while a total of 476 781 people have received their third. Bulawayo is leading in terms of overall coverage as 60 percent of its residents have received at least the first dose. The province has a target of vaccinating at least 569 010 residents to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19. The ongoing upgraded Covid-19 vaccination blitz was launched by Vice-President and Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Constantino Chiwenga on March 20. The blitz is being conducted in two phases, the first phase will end in April, while the second phase will run from May 2 to 15. The main aim of the campaign is to reach 70 percent of the total Zimbabwe population by the end of July 2022 in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) regulations. Government has confirmed that the country has enough vaccine stocks for the planned national vaccination blitz having received 22 405 000   Covid-19 vaccine doses and utilised 8 758 655 In an interview, Bulawayo provincial medical director Dr Maphios Siamuchembu said the blitz has come to an end now that schools are closed. “We managed to cover 45 000 people and the breakdown shows that 55 percent of learners aged 12-15 were reached while 16 percent of learners aged 16-17 were reached during the first phase and we are now looking forward to the second phase. We wish to have at least 60 percent of the total population fully vaccinated by the end of the second phase so that we get closer to reaching herd immunity as a city. “Vaccination has proven to reduce the severity of the disease, the need for hospitalisation and deaths. In Zimbabwe right now, to participate in any public event, it has become a requirement to bring a vaccination card. All these are reasons to encourage the citizenry to get vaccinated. I therefore, encourage everyone above 12 to get vaccinated. The vaccines are available free of charge,” said Dr Siamuchembu. — @thamamoe
