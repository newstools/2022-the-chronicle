The Chronicle Proverbs 3 vs 6
“For the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.” IN the book of Genesis, Joseph’s brothers hated him because his father favoured him over them and gave him a colourful coat. Joseph had a dream where God showed him that he would be a great leader and he shared the dream with his brothers. His brothers recognised his potential and interpreted the dream for him. Is it not interesting that it was not Joseph who interpreted the dream but it was his brothers who did that for him? This shows that sometimes your critics are probably just as gifted as you are but they are so focused on your gift and concerned about where God is taking you that they can’t even recognise or appreciate their own gifts.  They were so consumed with jealousy that they plotted to kill him. When we aim our jealousy at someone we may delay their blessing but we can’t stop it, we do not have the power to do that. Even in the mid of opposition and adversity, Joseph was still able to fulfil everything that God had said he would while his brothers suffered under the famine because of the curse they had brought upon themselves. As God would have it, the brother that they had tried to kill became their salvation and they ended up serving him. Do not be distracted or discouraged by other people’s insecurities and jealousy, walk in the fullness of who God has called you to be, unapologetically. If God has called you to greatness He will equip you, enable you and elevate you for His glory. Keep your eyes on the Lord. Be blessed.
