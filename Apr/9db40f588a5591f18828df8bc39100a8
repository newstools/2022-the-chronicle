We have grown and have branches that include City Centre, Magwegwe, Luveve, Filabusi, Entumbane, Cowdray Park, Khumalo, ZITF and Njube. “Our resilience to survive over the years taking note how Covid-19 pandemic affected some churches is through our culture where our teachings and impact cuts across people from diverse backgrounds, multiple ethnicities and professions. “Attendees should come geared up for a fresh outpouring of revival, an outbreak of miracles, signs and wonders,” said Prophet Edwards. -@mthabisi_mthire
