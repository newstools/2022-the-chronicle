TELECOMMUNICATIONS companies such as Econet and NetOne have gone big on innovation this year at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) as they are offering loads of gaming and social media enhancing tools to spice up their stands. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604381" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hall 4 at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre is the place to be as it houses the country’s biggest telecommunication giants. Innovation seems to be the key ingredient and driving force for almost all of the companies at this year’s trade showcase and the telecommunications sector did not want to be left behind. The companies seem keen to showcase that they are more than mobile service providers, but have branched out to other facets of technology such as gaming, virtual reality, e-learning, mobile money and being internet service providers.  It seems that the appeal is to the younger folk or the younger customer judging by the products that are on display. At the Econet stand, there is a dance floor, lit up with LED lights and many people were dancing on it, while music was being played. Local tribal house music group Djembe Monks gave those on the dance floor some of the music and their spokesperson Mr Emmanuel Nkomo urged people to visit the Econet stand at the ZITF. <img class="wp-image-604377 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-33-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-33-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-33-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Local tribal house music group Djembe Monks “Every person who is into music should check it out, the Econet stand, it’s a cutting-edge stand and they have made it vibrant and up to date with the latest technology. ‘They have gone big with the concept and this should be commended, as Econet has become more than a service provider,” said Mr Nkomo. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604384" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-35-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-35-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-35-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Also, at the stand there is a gaming room where various games can be played from Xbox or PlayStation, to car racing and virtual reality. Many people took their time to play the games there and enjoy themselves. It will be interesting to see if these will be open to the public tomorrow as they are very popular with children and the youth. Interestingly both Econet and NetOne had a 360 Visual maker stand that has become popular at various pop-up functions and upmarket eateries. Many people were taking their videos there intrigued by the outcome of the innovation. At NetOne, they had products such as a gaming room for virtual reality and then the Smart Education booth where one was taken through how the application works. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604386" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa is expected to preside over the official opening ceremony of the premium trade showcase today after President Kenyatta, who was scheduled to lead the proceedings, could not make it following the death of former Kenyan leader, Mwai Kibaki. The country’s prime trade and investment expo is being held under the theme, “Rethink, Reimagine, Reinvent Value Chains for Economic Development,” and a packed programme of conferences, sector specific fora and seminars has been lined up for the duration of the symposium. A total of 14 countries being represented by 21 exhibitors are taking part.
