LACK of sanitary wear has been an enduring problem for young girls and women, especially those living in the rural areas who resort to using unhygienic alternatives for relief.  Upon this realisation, songstress Nonkanyiso Mabaleka has scheduled a charity Afro Ball concert this Friday at Grand Vista where she, along with songstress Mimie Tarukwana and Rudo Amor will perform in order to raise funds to buy re-usable pads which they seek to donate to young girls in rural Esigodini. <img class="wp-image-601827 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mimie-Tarukwana.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mimie-Tarukwana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mimie-Tarukwana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mimie Tarukwana The reusable pads can be used for up to five years. Mabaleka said the idea comes to assist young girls who have to miss school on particular days of the month because they lack sanitary wear. “This idea of an Afro Ball had been on my mind before the advent of the Covid-19-induced lockdowns. It’s been a while since I had a Nonkanyiso Mabaleka concert so I didn’t want to call people to just come and listen to me sing. Instead, I wanted to sing for something that has meaning and sing to help someone,” she said. Following efforts to mobilise pads for girls who were failing to go to school because they didn’t have pads with fellow artistes some time back, Mabaleka said she realised that by getting them disposable pads, they were only assisting in the short term. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-452964" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/pads2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/pads2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/pads2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The challenge would not be solved by getting them disposable pads as they need them for a lifetime so I discovered that it was better to buy the re-usable pads which can be used for up to five years,” said Mabaleka. She said the re-usable pads are environment friendly, prevent unpleasant odours and reduce menstrual cramps. “The pads that we want to donate to the girls are part of a kit. We want to save a young girl from worrying about what she’s going to be using on her next cycle. “When it comes to periods, women are not open. I’m just glad that we can now speak about it and we’re putting up a concert that will help a girl out there because menstruation is not a choice for women,” she said. Mabaleka said the Afro Ball is a symbolism and celebration of modern Africans. <img class="alignnone wp-image-602002 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We opted to host an Afro Ball so as to celebrate Africa and who we are. It’ll be a celebration of who we’ve become so we’re hoping that everyone is going to dress in an African way, and of course a modern African way so as to incorporate the ball aspect. “It’s a Western concept, but we’re changing it to bring in Africa because this is who we are. We are a modern African people and we ought to celebrate that.” At the event, Mabaleka said they will showcase African Jazz and African soul. “We’re very lucky to have Possenti from Skyz Metro as the DJ and we’re thankful for Sizwakele who’ll be our host. She also happens to be my first sponsor,” said Mabaleka. She said the concert will be a red carpet event with hopes to expand the initiative to other areas. “For this concert, we’re looking to assist girls in Esigodini, but we hope to expand further to other areas. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Hope City church and Grand Vista and people can drop off donations there. “We’re hoping that people will support this initiative because if it’s well supported, it’ll mean that we’ll keep doing it because, quite frankly, in the rural areas there’s so much work to be done.” – @SeehYvonne
