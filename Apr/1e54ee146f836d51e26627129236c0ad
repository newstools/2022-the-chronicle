ALL eyes will be on Nqobizitha Masuku and Bill Antonio, who are undeniably the star attractions ahead of this afternoon’s Uhuru Cup final pitting Highlanders and Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium this afternoon. <img class="wp-image-593937 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bill Antonio That’s not to say both squads have no other players worth watching, but Masuku and Antonio have been a cut above the rest for their respective clubs. With both sides promising to throw in full strength squads, the duo should find themselves in the starting line ups for both teams. Bosso will be hoping Masuku recovers in time for the clash as he has been struggling with an injury that saw him missing Bosso’s last league match at Emagumeni. Masuku has been the top performer and a regular goal scorer for the Bosso. He has scored five goals this season and is the club’s leading scorer. He should not only be praised for his goal scoring, but the fact that he brings structure, organisation and stability to the midfield. His leadership skills have also been applauded regularly by coach Mandla Mpofu. <img class="size-full wp-image-599631" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> HIGHLANDERS head coach Mandla Mpofu Unlike his counterpart Antonio (19), who is young, Masuku has truly matured with age. For a game of this magnitude, Bosso are in desperate need of Masuku’s services. Ahead of the clash, Masuku said: “We want a positive result. There are no two ways about it, we have to win the game against our rivals Dynamos. We all know that it’s the Battle of Zimbabwe, so we will fight to win even though they are also preparing for us from thier end. We want a victory.” For Dynamos their go to person is Antonio.  The promising youngster has dominated the country’s back pages with his perfomances for DeMbare. He hogged the limelight with his wonder strike against Black Rhinos early this month. His dribbling skills and ability to score goals has seen the football family all agreeing that the boy is quite a talent. The biggest question ahead of this afternoon’s encounter is will Antonio rise to the occasion and prove his recent performances were not a fluke? He has the biggest stage to cement his name in the history books in front of a packed Barbourfields Stadium. – @innocentskizoe
