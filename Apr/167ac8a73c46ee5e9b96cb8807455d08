Morden Magnet Investments (MMI), founder and director, Philip Phiri said the amusement park will operate this weekend and on Monday. “Monday is a public holiday so we will take advantage of the Workers’ Day to entertain those who will fail to be with us over the weekend. The train will be there, the boats will be there and the big wheel. “This year’s event will be unique because we will have canoeing and speedboating for adults as well. The activities won’t be strictly for children,” said Phiri. Entry is going to be US$5 for adults and US$2 for children. Activities will cost between US$1 to US$3.
