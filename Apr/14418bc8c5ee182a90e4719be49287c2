The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Chicken Inn midfielder Bravie Ayanda Sibanda has joined Eswatini MTN Premier Soccer League side Tambankulu Callies on a one-year contract, Chronicle Sport has learnt.  Before joining Tambankulu Callies, Sibanda had a brief stint with Manzini Wanderers in the same country. “I am happy for the new challenge. I signed a one-year contract on 31 March after being called by the Tambankulu Callies chairman. It’s work in progress for me. It’s pleasing to make two consecutive starts at my new home,” said Sibanda. Tambankulu Callies are sixth on the league table with 33 points from 20 outings. Callies beat Green Mamba 3-1 at Prince Wales Stadium on Saturday, with Sibanda playing 90 minutes and chipping in with a goal assist. After struggling to command a starting place at Chicken Inn, together with Ben Nyahunzvi, Phakamani Dube, youngster Nyasha Gurende and Joe Nyabinde, among other players, Sibanda went for a trial stint at South Africa’s National First Division side Uthongathi FC. “I didn’t get enough game time at Chicken Inn and that is why I decided to go club hunting. This was coupled with the fact that salaries and other benefits in South Africa are always attractive. However, my focus is now on doing well at Tambankulu Callies. I will work hard to continue impressing the coaches and my new teammates,” he said. Uthongathi is home to ex-Highlanders’ striker Cleopas Dube, who joined the side following his release by Witbank Spurs. — @FungaiMuderere
