The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter THE mining sector has expressed optimism it will meet its annual production targets despite being disrupted by rains, which have affected several mining operations in the first quarter. Mines Parliamentary Portfolio Committee chairman, Mr Edmond Mkaratigwa, said the sector was encouraged by the implementation of the National Development Strategy (NDS1), and were geared to buttress its success. <img class="wp-image-583168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/cm.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/cm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/cm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mine He said the mines committee is currently touring gold production operations to ascertain the impact of S.1. 40 of 2022 Mining (General) (Amendment) Regulations on the gold production sector. Among other issues, the Statutory Instrument sets fees for special minerals lease inspections, prospective lease grants, annual fee for block of claims, special grants and mining leases of precious stones, renewals, transfers and export permit fees. During the first tour, the portfolio committee visited Bubi Milling Centre in Matabeleland North and milling centres in Gwanda, Matabeleland South. He said while the incessant rains received in some parts of the country do impact on gold operations, the disruption levels will not offset set output targets as the sector anticipates a production increase instead. “It (rain) will not affect overall gold targets because its natural in the gold sector that the rainy season may have some low production levels especially in small-scale mines,” said Mkaratigwa. “The production levels normally rise after the rainy season and we do not expect any dip in production as other seasons of the year will be compensatory. “Instead, we anticipate a significant increase owing to NDS1 implementation among other enabling efforts being undertaken.” Under the Second Republic, the country targets to establish more gold service centres across all the mining regions as a strategy towards attaining the US$12 billion milestone by 2023 with the gold sub-sector expected to contribute US$4 billion.  “In the first phase we visited the southern parts of the country, which took us to Midlands and Matabeleland provinces. “There are mixed findings in terms of positives and findings but largely, a lot of improvements have happened in the sector,” said Mkaratigwa. “There are also common challenges but basically, NDS1 has carried us to a better position and further steps building on the foundation will definitely help us build our country. We have visited just after the rains. So, the mines have not been fully operational.” -@nqobilebhebhe
