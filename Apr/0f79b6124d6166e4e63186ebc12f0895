DAYS after he picked a seemingly nasty right ankle injury when Hwange played against Talen Vision in a Zifa Southern Region Division One match at the Colliery Stadium on Saturday, Chipangano captain Felix Chindungwe started doing light training yesterday. The dreadlocked former Highlanders and Chicken Inn centre-back was ferried to hospital just before half-time. The coal miners won the game 2-0 and remain at the top of the league table. <img class="size-full wp-image-474274" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Bongani-Mafu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Bongani-Mafu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Bongani-Mafu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bongani Mafu In an interview yesterday, a relieved Chindungwe said he was pleased to be granted permission to start light training. “I’m in hospital as we speak and have just come from my physiotherapy session. I have been doing these sessions for three days. At first, we thought it was a nasty ankle injury, but x-ray results say otherwise. It is the ligaments that were slightly affected, hence the ankle has been swollen. I am happy that I have been allowed to start light training,” said Chindungwe. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585339" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-1-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-1-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-1-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benjani Mwaruwari Chindungwe has been a valuable player for Chipangano together with fellow experienced players Thabani Goredema and Canaan Nkomo. Hwange are now under the guidance of Edmore ‘Makhwebu’ Sibanda and Obert Moyo after the sudden departure of Bongani Mafu, who joined Ngezi Platinum Stars as assistant coach to ex-Warriors’ captain Benjani Mwaruwari.  There had been fears that Mafu’s project at Hwange had collapsed with his departure, but all seems to be well for the former Premiership outfit as they are yet to taste defeat. – @FungaiMuderere
