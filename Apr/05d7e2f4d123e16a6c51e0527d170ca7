Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube attended the annual Spring Meetings on behalf of Zimbabwe and   also held key meetings with global economic players. The African Consultative Group comprises the Fund Governors of a subset of 12 African countries belonging to the African Caucus (African finance ministers and central bank governors) and Fund Management.  It was formed in 2007 to enhance the IMF’s policy dialogue with the African Caucus and the group meets at the time of the Spring Meetings while Fund Management meets with the full membership of the African Caucus at the same time. The intervention is set to enhance member countries’ contribution to long-term balance of payments stability. The facility is expected to come into effect on May 1 following approval on April 13 by the IMF executive board and the loans will have a 20-year maturity and a 10-and-a-half-year grace period. The African Consultative Group said there is a need to address rising debt vulnerabilities of developing countries, particularly in Africa and finding effective ways to alleviate the weight of the debt service. <img class="size-full wp-image-603322" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The African Consultative Group It also stressed the need to continue working together to strengthen the debt resolution architecture, including by improving the Common Framework for debt treatments and technical assistance within the Multipronged Approach (MPA) to address the remaining capacity requirements.
