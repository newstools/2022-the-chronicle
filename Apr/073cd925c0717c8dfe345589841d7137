Gokwe South is endowed with Heritage and Cultural sites, wildlife, safaris in Chirisa Safari, natural heritage sites such as Gandavaroyi Gorge, Dzoritsvo Falls, Nhliziyana Falls, Sengwa Gorge and the magnificent Bopoma Falls. These sites, if effectively marketed, have potential to transform the Midlands town into a domestic tourism destination and enhance the country’s ZimBho campaign being spearheaded by the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA). ZTA spokesperson, Mr Godfrey Chris Koti, said yesterday’s meeting sought to strengthen relations between the Government and the private sector in an effort to work towards the attainment of a US$5 billion tourism economy by 2025 as is espoused in the Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy. <img class="size-full wp-image-601821" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Godfrey Chris Koti “The Deputy Minister is on a tour of the Midlands Province.
