The TG Silundika beauty pageant which took place in Mangwe, Plumtree last weekend saw hundreds of residents from the area rising to the occasion to show off their talents.  The event which was held in honour of the late national hero George Silundika aimed to promote the Kalanga language which the community said was slowly being forgotten. People participated in different activities such as a marathon, beauty pageant and traditional dances. Businesspeople also had an opportunity to sell their different products. Winners of the pageant went home smiling after grabbing prizes and certificates. Zibusiso Soleme (17) who was crowned Miss TiBaKalanga expressed her happiness. “This was my first time to contest and I was crowned Miss TiBaKalanga. I wasn’t expecting this and I’m proud of myself. Thanks to the organisers for acknowledging my talent. Shout out to the TG Silundika project for this initiative as participants were expected to speak in Kalanga as we were being asked questions. Poems were also done in Kalanga to promote the language. Some of us who weren’t so good with the language are now improving as we now have more knowledge about our culture”, she said. She requested more Kalanga teachers in the community citing reasons to improve their language. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602515" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-46-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-46-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-46-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I love modelling, I want to go far with it and represent BaKalanga. You never know, Miss Zimbabwe can come from the BaKalanga one day. I’m determined to follow this path and follow my passion,” Soleme said. First Princess was Sikhanyisile Ndlovu and second Princess was Carol Ncube. Founded by Tarcisius George Silundika Cultural Community Centre (TGSCCC) in 2015, the programme was initiated by the surviving family members of the late Zimbabwean nationalist. TGSCCC founder and project manager, Felix Felisizwe Silundika said they are glad that rural communities are responding positively concerning the establishment of the standard of excellence in cultural heritage sustainability and community development. “It feels good that our efforts to promote our Kalanga cultural heritage are beginning to get some traction as the rural communities are responding positively. The response by the rural communities is a development that gives us the energy to continuously explore new and innovative ways of getting the youth to learn the Kalanga language and culture. “The mission of this project is to promote Kalanga culture through creative community strategies that enhance economic growth and development, with a vision to establish the standard of excellence in cultural heritage sustainability and community development in Southern Africa,” Silundika said. – @SeehYvonne
