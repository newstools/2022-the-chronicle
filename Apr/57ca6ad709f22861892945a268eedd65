MANY employers and employees have conflicts related to the expectation of being re-engaged. Section 12B (3)(b) reads: (a) An employee is deemed to have been unfairly dismissed— (b) ) if, on termination of an employment contract of fixed duration, the employee— (i) had a legitimate expectation of being re-engaged; and (ii) another person was engaged instead of the employee. Any argument on expectation of being re-engaged arises and falls on the provisions of the Labour Act Chapter 28:01. The employee must be on Fixed Term Contract and Fixed Term Contract is identified by having a starting date and an ending date. Many employers wrongly use termination of a Fixed Term Contract as a means of getting undesirables and they then replace them with other employees. Such conduct by the employers is unlawful and can result in huge costs for the employer.  Where a Fixed Term Contract employee is terminated while the work is still there and another person is engaged, the courts will order reinstatement of the employee or payment of damages depending on circumstances of each case. On the other hand, employees who claim legitimate expectation of being re-engaged should go further and prove how things led to them believing that they had a legitimate expectation of being re-engaged and that another person was engaged in their place. On legitimate expectation, the employee should demonstrate how the legitimate expectation was created. For example, there must be evidence that the employer promised re-engagement and also that the employee was included in the employer’s plans beyond the life of a contract and many other similar acts. On the second test that somebody else was engaged, the employee must demonstrate that there was somebody else who was employed in their position and not transferred from another department as there is a clear distinction between staff movement within the organisation and engaging somebody, which is hiring. The issue of the expectation of being re-engaged has been dealt with in several cases such as TelOne vs Sengende – SC 64/2015 where the Supreme Court said: “On expectation of being re-engaged the burden of proof lies with the employee.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604090" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-59-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-59-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-59-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The same position was also addressed by Kundai Magodora V Care International – SC 191/13 where the Supreme Court said: “To succeed in expectation of being re-engaged, an employee should provide evidence of the expectation of being re-engaged and that someone else was employed in their place”. Workers have also used the argument around International Conventions on casualisation of labour. These do not arise as the Zimbabwe Constitution is very clear in that until the International Conventions are written into our legislation, they are not applicable. The lead cases on that are Kundai Magodora V Care Interntional – SC 191/13 mentioned earlier and Simbi (Steelmakers) (Private) Limited V M Shamu and others – SC71/2015 where the Supreme Court emphasised the position mentioned above. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604093 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In conclusion, no Fixed Term Contract employee should be terminated and replaced by another even if there is a clause in the contract that says in this contract there is no expectation of being re-engaged as the provisions of the Labour Act will override the agreement and the courts will enquire into the conduct of the parties resulting in an expensive re-engagement or payment of damages.
