The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau POLICE in Limpopo province, in South Africa, have recovered 116 goats worth R240 000 that had been stolen from Zimbabwe and arrested four people in connection with the matter.  The goats were being kept at farms around Limpopo and Gauteng province and were sold mainly in Gauteng.

He said upon further interrogation, the accused persons failed to produce proper documentation of the livestock and were immediately arrested. The vehicle and its trailer were in turn seized by the police. Preliminary investigations, he said, revealed that the quartet had skipped the border from Zimbabwe and was en route to Gauteng province to sell the stolen livestock. “Afterwards, the member from Corporate Communications, together with the Limpopo Provincial Stock Theft and Vereeniging Stock Theft Unit conducted a tactical intelligence-driven operation in Gauteng province and subsequently recovered 28 stolen goats which were kept at a plot in Vereeniging policing precinct,” said Lt Col Seabi.  <img class="alignnone wp-image-503429 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/goats.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/goats.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/goats-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said the operation continued to Musina in Limpopo province resulting in the recovery of 116 goats believed to have been stolen from Zimbabwe. The police estimate that the stolen goats are worth R240 000. Lt Col Seabi said preliminary investigations revealed that the livestock was illegally transported from Zimbabwe and kept at a farm outside Musina for brand marking and transportation to Gauteng province. The provincial police commander (Limpopo), Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe commended the two police officers for their commitment to duty. “If every police officer and member of the community can work like this, crime levels will be reduced drastically across the province,’ she said.Last year, the police in Beitbridge arrested businesswoman, Sarah Chauke who is believed to have orchestrated the theft of over 150 goats worth $663 000 around the Lutumba and Tshapfutshe areas, in Ward 5. Chauke, of Juta village, who runs a bar at Lutumba Business Centre, is alleged to be the brains behind stealing goats with her cabal, which they would slaughter and smuggle the meat to South Africa where there is a ready market. – @tupeyo.
