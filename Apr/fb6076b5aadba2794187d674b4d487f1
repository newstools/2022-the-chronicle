They were excited when I told them that there will be some visitors and they feel at home when they have visitors. When they socialise with people, it gives them confidence. The children are orphans and it’s great for them to be interacting with people like you,” said Mr Maphala. He said the institution needs on average of US$11 000 per month to take care of the children and meet other expenses. Mr Maphala said they had cut down from a capacity of 54 to 24 children. <img class="wp-image-604948 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/32-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/32-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/32-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZIMBABWE Newspapers (1980) Limited “As an institution we have challenges in raising enough money to feed the children and pay bills,” he said. Mr Maphala said former inmates of the home also helped them from time to time. “There are some who have left the institution and one of them is now at Lupane State University. There are many others now in different places but many of them still remember us hence they donate in cash and kind from time to time,” said Mr Maphala. Mrs Matanda said instead of networking with business people, Zimbabwe Newspapers (1980) Limited decided to do so over lunch with children. “Normally during ZITF business organisations network during cocktail parties. B-Metro, UMthunywa, Chronicle and Sunday News decided to have lunch with you and network with the boys and girls. We are so happy, we love children,” said Mrs Matanda. She encouraged the children to join the Zimbabwe Newspapers (1980) Limited Media Club so that they can share stories from their point of view. “We have realised that sometimes you don’t need much, you just need people around you and building relations with those who can share their time and laugh with you.  Hence the need to visit children at Children’s Homes is a noble undertaking. Jesus Christ even mentioned the need to visit those in need as an expression of real faith,” said Mrs Matanda. She said after consultations on the needs of the institution,  the company will be back to help where they can.
