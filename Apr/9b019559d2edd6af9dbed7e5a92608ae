FARMERS in Midlands Province have shifted their focus to winter wheat following a disappointing summer season characterised by prolonged dry spells leading to a compromised yield.  Although harvesting is still ongoing, the expected yield has since been compromised after most of the crop was declared a write-off. In an update on the crop and livestock situation in the province, provincial crop and livestock officer Mrs Medline Magwenzi said most of the crop did not do well during the 2021/22 season and not much is expected. “Despite the province having the biggest hectarage planted, the effects of climate change are being felt in the province just like in any other parts of the country. Out of the total hectarage of maize, 80 percent did not do well, while only 10 percent is good and another 10 percent has chances of making it if more rains are received,” she said. Some climate proof crops like cotton, however, are doing well with about 70 percent doing good while 10 percent is fair and 20 percent is average. The province also has sunflower, which is thriving under difficult circumstances. “Ninety percent of sunflower is actually doing very well. We also planted 460ha of potatoes and so far, we have harvested 246ha and I am happy that the potatoes are doing very well,” she said. She said those that followed the standard procedure of Intwasa/Pfumvudza have a thriving maize crop and are the ones expecting a better harvest. <img class="alignnone wp-image-540554 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/intwasa-food.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/intwasa-food.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/intwasa-food-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Millet and sorghum were also affected by the prolonged dry spell, but there is still hope that something will be harvested. She said if more rains are not received, livestock will soon be walking long distances for water and pastures. “Water for irrigation is good, but grass is already drying up. If the situation continues, by May or June our livestock will be facing challenges in getting pastures. I urge all farmers to make hay and also use the failed crop as animal feed,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-469421 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/livestock.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/livestock.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/livestock-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Magwenzi said the province is targeting to put about 6 500ha under winter wheat, up from 5  448ha in 2021. “We have registered 6 500ha for winter wheat and they will have enough water from start to finish given that our dams received enough water. The farmers have since shifted focus so that we utilise the water in our dams,” she said. Seed, Compound D and top-dressing fertilisers have since been dispatched to Grain Marketing Board depots across the province courtesy of the Presidential Input Scheme. “We have already started distribution of inputs to our farmers so that we plant in time. Besides the presidential schemes, we also have the Agro-Yield supported by CBZ as well as the AFC who have contracted about 1 000ha. All is ready and all farmers should start planting anytime from now,” she said.
