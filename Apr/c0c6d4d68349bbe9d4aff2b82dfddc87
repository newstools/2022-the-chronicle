SUSPECTED armed highway robbers are reportedly on the prowl along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls road with their latest victim being a Lupane businessman whom they robbed of US$1 800 at gunpoint.  Police did not reveal the name of the victim who operates two service stations, one at Lupane Centre and the other at Gwayi Business Centre. The businessman was driving from Gwayi Business Centre where he had just collected the day’s takings at his service station when two unidentified men travelling in a Honda Fit without number plates intercepted him. The incident occurred on April 14 in the afternoon between Halfway Hotel and Gwayi River. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Glory Banda confirmed the incident, saying the suspects are still at large. He said the suspects allegedly forced the victim to pull off the road after encroaching onto the lane of oncoming traffic and tried to overtake him. Upon stopping, they immediately pounced on him. <img class="size-full wp-image-603048" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/CAR.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/CAR.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/CAR-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The owner of this garage in Lupane was robbed at gunpoint along the Bulawayo Vic Falls “On 14 April around midday, the complainant left Gwayi Business Centre for Lupane driving his car, a green Nissan Sylphy, after collecting money from his service station at Gwayi Business Centre. After travelling for about 10km from the business centre, the victim saw a silver Honda Fit without number plates following him before intending to overtake him in-front of an oncoming haulage truck,” said Insp Banda. He said the businessman pulled off the road and stopped his car after plunging into a pothole. The driver of the Honda Fit also pulled off and stopped his car in front of the victim’s vehicle. “When the complainant got out of his vehicle to check if his car had not been damaged, two suspects with faces covered in balaclava, disembarked from the Honda Fit and confronted him before they demanded money,” said the police spokesperson. <img class="size-full wp-image-576118" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Inspector-Glory-Banda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Inspector-Glory-Banda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Inspector-Glory-Banda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Glory Banda “One of the suspects drew a gun from his trousers pocket and pointed it at the complainant before they robbed him of US$1 800. They also took his phone, removed sim card and handed him back the gadget.” The two suspects allegedly ordered the victim to get into the car and drive off. They remained at the scene. The businessman proceeded to Lupane Police Station where he reported the matter. Insp Banda said no arrest has been made and appealed to members of the public who might have information about the suspects’ whereabouts to notify police or contact any nearest police station. – @ncubeleon
