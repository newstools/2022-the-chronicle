The brigade extricated seven people who were trapped inside the kombi with six of them already dead,” he said. Mr Phiri said the injured were rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital by three ambulances. Former Bulawayo mayor, Mr David Ndlovu who was at the scene said it was unfortunate that lives continue to be lost due to carelessness by drivers. Meanwhile, six Harare Polytechnic members of staff who were coming to the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) escaped death by a whisker when the bus they were travelling in was involved in an accident on Sunday.  “The Harare Polytechnic bus that was ferrying its members to the ZITF in Bulawayo was involved in an accident at the 374km peg on the Bulawayo-Harare road when the driver lost control of the vehicle and went off the road. The vehicle rolled twice and landed on its left side,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. He said the injured were ferried to hospital for treatment. — @themkhust
