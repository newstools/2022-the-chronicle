The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Reporter Zanu-PF’s recruitment drive got a major boost this week as it maximised on its presence at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo to register new members and further sell its people-centred policies. <img class="wp-image-590823 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ZANU-PF-SUPPORTERS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ZANU-PF-SUPPORTERS.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/ZANU-PF-SUPPORTERS-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZANU PF SUPPORTERS Zanu-PF has embarked on an ambitious drive to drum up support, aiming to get five million votes in the 2023 harmonised elections. Yesterday, the first public day, multitudes thronged the ruling party’s stand keen to join the party. The Chronicle news crew saw youths and the elderly joisting to fill in registration forms to be members. To join the party, only US$3 or equivalent in local currency at the official rate was required. At most one needed only five minutes to complete the registration process. Youths interviewed said Zanu-PF is the only party whose policies resonate with them, hence the need to be members. “This is a proud moment for me to join Zanu-PF,” said Yolanda Nxumalo (23) soon after receiving her card. “I feel proud that I can participate in party activities as a full member and I even bought myself a party T-shirt.”. Mr Khumbulani Ndlovu of Nkulumane (34) said he is impressed with Zanu-PF policies and President Mnangagwa’s popular mantra of leaving no one and no place behind. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604761 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “My major task as a full Zanu-PF member is to mobilise other youths to join the party,” he said. Zanu-PF Director of Research, Cde Davison Gomo said they were overwhelmed with the enthusiasm shown by people in joining and getting a deeper understanding of Zanu-PF. “The Zanu-PF department of Commissariat’s major task is to make sure that we mobilise communities and the whole of Zimbabwe to support Zanu-PF. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604773 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A huge number of people have passed through the stand and people of all age groups are interested in how to be a Zanu-PF member, what are their rights and responsibility,” he said. “They also wanted to know the definition of our structures, what are a cell, branch and district. “What was interesting was the excitement about membership cards. We captured all new members on our electronic database.” New members are from all age groups and gender, he said. “We saw multitudes of youths showing great desire to be members of Zanu-PF”. Cde Gomo said they feel encouraged by the response as it showed that Zanu-PF policies resonate with Zimbabweans. “To us it shows that we are in touch with the people, offering real-life solutions to them hence the enthusiasm we are witnessing. The five million target we set will be surpassed,” said Cde Gomo. Zanu-PF Youth League National Secretary for Production and Labour, Cde Christine Taruwona said inquiries by the youths were centred on business opportunities and how to be members. “We shared business opportunities that are available to the youth in all sectors of the economy. Youths who visited our stand were keen on empowerment programmes that they can take part in. “To us, it shows that Zanu-PF policies are very much attractive to Zimbabweans. From the contacts we got, we will link the youths with various organisations for funding and mentorship”.  Director of Information and Publicity of National Organisation for Development and Empowerment, Cde Mildred Mushonga said: “Our key message was, as youth we must rally behind Zanu-PF and President Mnangagwa. The future looks bright and the youth should play an active role in propagating Zanu PF policies. Judging by several youths who visited our stand, we feel our mission or exhibition was a success”. — @nqobilebhebhe
