THE greatest fear among innovators in Zimbabwe is that when they pitch ideas they can be stolen, hence their reluctance to divulge the full details of their products. These were the sentiments of some innovators at the ZITF Innovators Forum held at the Members Pavilion in Bulawayo yesterday. The forum brought together students from various universities to pitch their innovative products to solve some of the challenges in Zimbabwe. Some of the products cover health care, environment and climate change, education and Information Communication Technology solutions.  Speaking after giving her pitch on Candiderm, an antifungal cream, Miss Vimbai Melissa Marange from Chinhoyi University of Technology said it was difficult for them to give full details of how the product was developed. “My number one fear is that when you pitch ideas someone will steal that idea or give you small monies or take that idea and develop it as their own,” said Miss Marange. “So, I have to be very careful on how much information I share.” She said even during her presentation, she was not at liberty to delve into detail on how she came up with the antifungal cream using local plants and what ingredients she uses. Miss Marange has developed an antifungal cream that is yet to be patented as it is ready for clinical and human trials, which she said will be ready during the year. She, however, commended the ZITF Innovators Forum as it gives her motivation to do better. “Being in such forums is good as you see how other people pitch their ideas. This will motivate some of us on how I can improve my pitching. These are great platforms,” said Miss Marange. Mr Nyasha Brian Namaja from Midlands State University, who runs a beverage company, Fruty Beverage, said patenting was very important. <img class="size-full wp-image-603735" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-36-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Nyasha Brian Namaja from Midlands State University “Patenting a product is very important and what I have learnt here is that we can do so by patenting the packaging, logo and also our design. “This innovators forum is an important piece for us innovators as it showcases our products,” said Mr Namaja who is the founder and CEO of the company. He said as a start-up, the company has teething problems chief among them packaging. Another innovator, Mr Tendai Gatahwa who developed a mobile app that informal traders can use for transactions, basically a point of sale, said the ZITF forum was important. “The innovators forum is important for us young people as it brightens up and puts a spotlight to our ideas. I specialise in Block Chain technology which isn’t that new, but people are trying to integrate into their systems. This is what we are doing with our product,” said Mr Gatahwa. He said he was well prepared for the pitch and hopes for the best. Ms Sicelo Dube, director of Elevate Trust said concerns by the innovators were valid and that as an organisation they try to curb theft of ideas. <img class="wp-image-603738 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-37-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-37-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-37-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Sicelo Dube, director of Elevate Trust “We are aware of that and that’s why the first speaker spoke about IP (intellectual property) protection because we know it’s the biggest worry. “There are some corporates and individuals who are older and haven’t been kind to the young people. At Elevate we want to bridge that gap between the innovator and the company. We so want to curb theft of ideas,” said Ms Dube. The ZITF Innovators Forum is organised and sponsored by Utande, Elevate Trust and Telone. A total of 13 teams pitched their ideas with results of winners set to be announced today. The Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) roared into life yesterday amid an upsurge in the number of participants, which has forced organisers to expand exhibition space to accommodate more businesses. President Mnangagwa is expected to preside over the official opening ceremony this Friday. <img class="size-full wp-image-597730" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa The country’s prime trade and investment expo is being held under the theme, “Rethink, Reimagine, Reinvent Value Chains for Economic Development,” and a packed programme of conferences, sector specific fora and seminars has been lined up for the duration of the symposium. — @bonganinkunzi
