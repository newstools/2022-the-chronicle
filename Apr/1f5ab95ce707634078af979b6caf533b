The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Chronicle Reporter THE census is progressing well in Matabeleland South province with some enumerators having completed work in their areas. The 2022 Population and Housing Census started on April 20 and will be concluded on April 30. Preliminary results are expected three months after the completion of the exercise as the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) has employed Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) in data gathering which makes the job easier. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604129" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/zimstat.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/zimstat.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/zimstat-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZimStat is in charge of conducting the population and housing census which will provide critical information that informs policy formulation. While Zimbabwe has conducted a population census at 10-year intervals since 1982, this is the first time the country is conducting a housing census. The housing census seeks to establish the quality of life of Zimbabweans. ZimStat enumerators have been visiting households and institutions across the country asking questions pertaining to socio-economic and demographic characteristics of households. <img class="size-full wp-image-602139" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/census-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/census-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/census-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Census enumerators waiting to gather census data from inmates at Ingutsheni Central Hospital in Bulawayo Enumerators are moving in both urban and rural communities, knocking on doors and asking for the data on who spent census night in each household. In line with the Census and Statistics Act, all information collected during the exercise is confidential and will be used for statistical purposes only. In an interview, Matabeleland South provincial statistician, Mr Munyaradzi Bote said all enumeration areas in the province were expected to have been covered by Friday. He urged members of the public to be on the lookout as there were bogus enumerators who were moving around purporting to be ZimStat enumerators. “The census process is going on well and we have covered much ground in both urban and rural areas. Some enumerators have completed their enumeration areas and some are doing what is known as call backs. This is for example where an enumerator goes to a household but there is no one and they have to go back again,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604137 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/cen2022.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/cen2022.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/cen2022-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Another example of a call back is when there is an error in the data which has been collected. We have a data quality management team and if they notice an error in information that has been submitted, they send back the information for verification which may require an enumerator to go back to the ground.” He said while rains had threatened the exercise, efforts have been made to ensure that enumerators continue with their work in order to meet the set deadline. Mr Bote said meetings were being held at district and provincial command centres daily to ensure that all is on track. He said efforts have been made to ensure that all key target populations were covered. “We have cases where enumerators need transport and we have catered for that. We have people who are trained in sign language who are on standby when their services are needed. Enumerators and supervisors meet every day to discuss challenges and gaps that need to be covered. We expect to meet the April 30 deadline because everything is on track,” said Mr Bote. Residents in the province confirmed that they have received visits from ZimStat enumerators. Mrs Fellunah Mswere who lives in Gwanda CBD said she was confident that the census process will be accurate as enumerators were collecting the information digitally. Mr Trust Ncube from Senondo area in Gwanda said enumerators had passed through his home to collect data.  He said this year’s questionnaire is more detailed than previous ones. Mr Ncube said the questions interrogate the living conditions of every citizen, from the youngest member of the family to the oldest and even domestic workers. He said this will provide Government with a clear picture of challenges faced by all members of society. — @DubeMatutu
