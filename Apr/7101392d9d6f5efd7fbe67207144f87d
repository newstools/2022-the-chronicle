The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS could win the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title but are their championship aspirations realistic? Bosso have not hidden their intentions of wanting to win the league. They are on a five-game unbeaten run and placed ninth on the league table, 10 points behind pace setters Chicken Inn. Bosso coach Mandla Mpofu put on a brave face in his weekly presser on Thursday as he insisted that they were not out of the race as yet. “We are still within reach. We will fight. It’s 24 matches to play and we are hopeful as a team that we will meet our goal. With the team that we have, we are hopeful,” said Mpofu. Bosso had an incredibly difficult start to the season but they seem to have found some good rhythm and are getting good results, especially at home. The home wins have been emphatic, although some may criticise the quality of opposition that Bosso have overcome.\  But is winning at home enough to put them in the title race? Looking at their away form, the answer would be no. Their last set of three points on the road was in 2018. This season alone, they have been on the road five times and managed three stalemates and two defeats. While coach Mpofu insists that they are gunning for the elusive league title, it seems a dream too far, especially considering their awful away record. Mpofu and his charges know until they fix that problem, they may as well forget about the league title. Commenting on their away record, midfielder Adrian Silla said: “I feel we are missing a lot of chances when we play away from home. We just hope that in our next away game we get three points.” Defender Crispen Ncube also weighed in on the matter. “We are working hard as a team to get points away from home. We know someday we will get those points on the road. The good thing is we are not losing away matches anymore, so we are building on that,” said Ncube. – @innocentskizoe
