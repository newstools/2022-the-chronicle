Their presence at the trade expo is set to give attendees the Midas touch of traditional cuisine foods which are a way of life of Zimbabweans. In an interview on the sidelines of the exhibition stand, Hotplate Grillhouse director Benson Muneri said: “The idea behind our presence at ZITF is the desire to expose the brand to the nation of Zimbabwe and international audience confirming that we have arrived and are ready to be counted among the real players in the market. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603918" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Grill-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Grill-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Grill-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We have 25 stores in Zimbabwe and hope to finish the year with over 30 stores.”  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603921" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Grill-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Grill-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Grill-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Meanwhile, First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa is set to visit the stand tomorrow.
