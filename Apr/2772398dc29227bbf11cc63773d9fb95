Ms Nkomo said the exhibition space has been taken up by both local and foreign exhibitors and as ZITF they were confident of a successful exhibition week.  The ZITF Chief Executive Officer, Dr Nicholas Ndebele said 471 exhibitors have taken up exhibition space and there was an overflow of 128 exhibitors. Ms Nkomo said efforts were underway to ensure all those interested in participating  at this year’s trade showcase are  accommodated. “Efforts are being made to accommodate everyone. This is a critical marketing   platform for the country which should accommodate all businesses that want to use it,” she said. Ms Nkomo said ZITF was also a platform for SMEs to interact and learn from established businesses as they work to grow their businesses. “SMEs are a very critical component of ZITF and we want to nurture them because we appreciate that many big businesses today started as SMEs,” said Ms Nkomo. She said it is a fact that most world economies are being driven by SMEs hence the need to support them.. Angola, Belarus, Botswana, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia have confirmed their participation this year. — @sikhulekelaniM1
