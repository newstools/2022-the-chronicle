The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Health Reporter ZIMPAPERS Bulawayo branch yesterday joined the national cleanup campaign as part of its contribution to keep Bulawayo clean.  The team drawn from a number of departments including editorial and finance started the clean-up at the corner of Leopold Takawira Avenue and Samuel Parirenyatwa Street.  Of note the team expressed disappointment in the number of used condoms littering Samuel Parirenyatwa Street, a road that is used by pupils going to and from Milton Junior and Coghlan Primary School.  Mr Mbonisi Sibanda, the branch human resources officer said every resident in Bulawayo had a part to play in bringing back the city to its former glory of cleanliness.  “As digital and publishing division Bulawayo unit in our effort to complement the national clean-up campaign we felt the urge to also contribute towards a clean and fresh city.  Members of staff were drawn from all departments and we had a positive turn out as people heeded the call to partake in this noble cause,” he said.   “As a city we still have a long way to go in making sure our surroundings are clean due to litter that is all over our surroundings.  We decided to do our cleanup campaign starting from the Leopold Takawira Avenue moving along Samuel Parirenyatwa Street right through to Milton Junior.”  Ms Bahle Ncube, the administration assistant urged corporates to join in numbers in order to keep Bulawayo clean all the time not only on special days. “Zimpapers Bulawayo branch proudly joined the nation in the cleanup campaign today, 1 April 2022. We proudly joined this initiative in an effort to show Bulawayo citizens the importance of living in a clean environment. We as individuals should not litter as this exposes us and especially our children to a hazardous environment. Let’s all support recycling initiatives, as these will leave our environment clean,” she said. – @thamamoe.
