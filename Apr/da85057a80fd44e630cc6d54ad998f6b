The award-winning nutrition start-up which was established three years ago by Nyaradzo Dhliwayo-Moyo aims to feed the nation with healthy meals and also making sure that there is a variety when it comes to eating healthy. “Nyaradzo who is from Masvingo is a restaurateur, award-winning creative designer, photographer and entrepreneur,” shared the YANAYA team. Detailing how the start-up came to life, they said: “In 2016, Nyaradzo returned home from South Africa where she was studying. It was immediately apparent to her that there was a huge yawning market gap in the food outlet space for healthy plant-based food. “A vegetarian herself at the time, she struggled to find local restaurants serving food for that market segment and out of that frustration, the resolve to attack that market gap was cemented. Working from her rented apartment, Nyaradzo would prepare meals for fellow vegetarians who shared her frustrations and would deliver them to them using a hired taxi.  “Her initial capital into the business was her own US$50 grocery budget, during that time and her smartphone became her most priced asset to the business. Nyari, as she is affectionately known, continues to launch pioneering products into the market having recently launched a dairy-free range of products which include milk, ice cream and yoghurt available in stores nationwide. “She continues to apply her creative mind to bring much-needed innovation into the food industry.”
Commenting on the Bulawayo launch on Thursday, Nyari said: “I’m excited that finally, we’ve come to the City of Kings and Queens, a welcoming and warm place. We’ve been receiving overwhelming support and love on the social media platforms for a while now and to finally open a branch here, is not only an achievement for us but an honour. “We are also delighted in getting to work with local businesses we have engaged for supplies that we’ll be using in the restaurant. We are committed to bringing fresh, tasty and nourishing food options to everyone. Our menu is packed to cater to meat lovers, vegetarians and vegans,” she said while inviting people to visit YANAYA for a healthy lifestyle that will indeed end in health.
