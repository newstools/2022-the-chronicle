The Chronicle 2 Corinthians 6: 14 KJV
“Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?”  One of the most crucial decisions that a human being will ever make in life is deciding on whom to marry. Marriage is more complex than we assume. It involves the amalgamation of two different individuals and two different families. Marriage will test a couple beyond borders and limits. It will test the foundation upon which it has been based and if the foundation is weak it will surely crumble. People nowadays are divorcing at an alarming rate.  Marriage is no longer given the respect that it deserves. What type of a partner must an individual marry? What is the basis of selecting? Is religion important when considering a lifetime partner? My answer is YES! <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603060" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In Judges 14: 1-10 we read the story of Samson who is born to a couple that loved God. Samson was groomed in the fear of the Lord yet he had a weakness of rebellion. Among his people, the Israelites, he could have married a godly woman because of his upbringing – but he decided to go and marry a foreigner (read Judges 14: 1-2 KJV). Not only was she a foreigner, she was a foreigner that worshipped other gods! She was a foreigner who did not know Samson’s culture and customs. This woman could not understand his beliefs. We are temples of the living God, how then is it possible to co-habit with an unbeliever? This is happening nowadays Don’t become partners with those who reject God. How can you make a partnership out of right and wrong? That’s not partnership: that’s war. The Word of God clearly states its opinion towards being unequally yoked with unbelievers. We have born again people who are going into the world to get partners who are not born again with the intention of bringing and converting them to Christianity. When a person attempts to do such, war is inevitable. God Bless!
