Motorists buying licence discs at the Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) stand at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) will be exempt from paying penalties. <img class="size-full wp-image-542790" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZITF-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZITF-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZITF-680x380-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The number of unlicensed vehicles is hovering around 400 000, according to official figures. It is not the first time that the roads authority has exempted defaulting motorists from paying penalties as it encourages motorists to be compliant. This year’s ZITF is running under the theme, “Rethink, Reimagine, Re-invent Value Chains for Economic Development”. In an interview at the parastatal’s stand yesterday, Zinara corporate communications manager, Mr Tendai Mugabe, said provision of quality services must be supported by adequate compliance. In that regard, he said Zinara’s interventions have yielded a sharp decline in the number of unlicensed vehicles.  “At some point we had about 600 000 unlicensed vehicles but the figure is going down because many motorists are registering their vehicles,” said Mr Mugabe. He attributed this development to concerted efforts by Zinara such as blitz operations and the promotion that it normally runs during ZITF. “The figure has significantly dropped from 600 000 to about 400 000 which is very encouraging,” said Mr Mugabe. He said Zinara was dedicated to offering competent services to motorists and hinted that it could introduce special rewards for motorists who are compliant. “The goal this year is to ensure we increase the number of compliant motorists in terms of vehicle licensing hence we are continuing with this promotion which we run every year. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603672" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-23-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This year we intend to introduce special rewards for compliant motorists,” said Mr Mugabe. — @eMKlass_49
