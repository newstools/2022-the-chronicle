THE Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season has been pulsating, with three teams vying for the championship while nine others are staring relegation. Championship chasing Dynamos and Chicken Inn won their respective weekend games by identical 1-0 score lines, with DeMbare edging Manica Diamonds at the National Sports Stadium and the Gamecocks overcoming Bulawayo City. Ghanaian forward Emmanuel Paga scored for Dynamos while striker Marlvin Hwata’s strike was enough to bag maximum points for Chicken Inn. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603544" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-63-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-63-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-63-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dynamos’ win saw Manica Diamonds sliding a place down the ladder to fourth position, six points behind DeMbare, who top the table tied on 26 points with Chicken Inn. Dynamos have a superior goal difference and occupy top place. Third-placed Triangle United made sure they stayed within the title race, taking their points tally to 23 following a 2-1 home win over Caps United. Russel Madamombe and Dzingai Chirambamuriwo got the goals for Triangle, with Caps United’s face-saver coming from Rodwell Chinyengetere. <img class="size-full wp-image-603547" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-64-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-64-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-64-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Russel Madamombe Triangle are the dark horses in the title race and are heavily breathing on the necks of Dynamos and Chicken Inn. It is the survival race that has also been fantastic, with the bottom half of nine teams not safe. The last half has Highlanders, Bulawayo Chiefs, Cranborne Bullets, Tenax, Harare City, Yadah, ZPC Kariba, Whawha and Bulawayo City. Highlanders remained glued in 10th place with 14 points after their match against FC Platinum was abandoned in the 84th minute with the score line reading 1-1. They are just three points above relegation. Yadah occupy the last relegation slot in 15th place with 11 points. There were positional changes at the bottom, with Yadah moving a place up following their 3-1 win against Tenax.  ZPC Kariba slipped into relegation, landing in 16th position from 14th following a 0-1 home defeat to Ngezi Platinum Stars. The electricity generators have 10 points from 12 games. Harare City drew 0-0 with Black Rhinos and fell a place down the ladder to 14th with 12 points. Bulawayo Chiefs ended an eight-match winless streak with a 1-0 victory against Whawha, a result that moved them a place up the ladder into 11th position with 14 points. Chiefs held onto a second-half goal by former Warriors’ striker Perfect Chikwende.
