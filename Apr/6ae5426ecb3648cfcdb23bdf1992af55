TWO alleged robbers were on Tuesday morning shot, one of them fatally while speeding off a security checkpoint. The suspects are members of a six-man gang that allegedly robbed a Chiredzi businessman and his wife of a Toyota Prado, a Nissan Caravan, US$1 000, R8 000 and an assortment of cellphones on Monday evening. National police spokesman, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the shooting incident occurred at a roadblock 5km before Beitbridge town along the Masvingo Road. He said the suspects were believed to be operating between Beitbridge and Musina. “The matter is now under investigation,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. “We want to warn those who terrorise members of the community and businessmen that their days are numbered. Preliminary investigations reveal that one of the suspects had hired the vehicle for R400 on the pretext he was taking a sick person to a traditional healer in Masvingo,” said Asst Comm Nyathi.  “The six went to Chikombedzi where three of them attacked a businessman and his wife and stole two vehicles and money at gun point. They then escaped in a Nissan Caravan which they dumped some 40km away along the Rutenga to Sango border post road before transferring into a Honda Fit”. He said the armed robbery was reported to the police who later picked information that they were travelling towards Beitbridge. “They were stopped at a roadblock near Beitbridge and they sped away with police shooting at the vehicle. Resultantly, some of the suspects were shot, one Ncube was dumped at a house in Beitbridge and later sent to the hospital,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said one of the unidentified suspects was found dead in the bullet riddled Honda Fit (AFL 9425), at Mdau Business Centre in Beitbridge on Tuesday evening. A pistol with eight rounds, R8 070 and US$205 were recovered. The other suspects, he added, are still on the run. @tupeyo
