The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter BULAWAYO-based KeYona TV is inviting lyricists, songwriters and composers to try their artistry via a new music show that will see them selecting a vocalist that resonates with their proposed and preferred sound. Dubbed “Zone Vibes Tshisa Friday!” the auditioning system for Season 1 will only be open to auditionees who have never been on stage or in a studio before. The auditions are set to take place between 9 and 10 April at Amakhosi Studios. Creatives interested in the opportunity are encouraged to send in their voice notes or copy of the song to producers and this will enable them to book an off-the-camera audition before 10 April. -@eMKlass_49
