ORDINARY Level results are expected to be released next week, a normal timeframe for their release according to the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec).  The examination council has said there has been no delay in the release of Grade Seven, Ordinary and Advanced Level results. The notice and clarification have been made after people have been complaining about a delay on the release of results. In a statement, Zimsec clarified that it has just followed its tradition of releasing results two months after the last exam is written. It reminded the nation that there were Covid-19 disruptions in the opening and closing of schools throughout the previous year, leading to a delay in starting exams. “The 2021 school calendar was disrupted as the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education had to put in place mitigatory measures to curb the upsurge and spread of the novel virus. These measures saw schools opening for the first term 2021 on March 15 to June 4 and second/third term opening on August 30 and closing on December 17,” read the statement. Zimsec said exams which usually begin in October and end in November, were rescheduled to begin on December 1, 2021, to allow candidates and teachers to complete the learning process that had been disturbed by the mitigation measures put in place to stem the spread of Covid-19. Therefore, candidates were able to sit for exams till January 31, 2022. “Traditionally, that is before the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 Global pandemic, the results of the Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are released two months after the date of writing the last examination paper, hence results were released between 1 and 15 February, Zimsec has observed this time period of two months after the last examination paper for 2021 was written on 31 January 2022. The December 2021/2022 Advanced Level examination results were released on 5 April 2022 and the Ordinary Level examination results will be released next week,” read the statement. The A-level pass rate increased this year despite low registration and Covid-19 challenges that affected the education sector. Released A-level results show an 84,7 percent pass rate, which is a 3,5 percent increase from the previous year in which the pass rate was 81,2 percent. “There was a decrease of 2,03 percent in the candidate entries where the total number of candidates who sat for the November 2021 examinations was 49 128 compared to 50 287 in November 2020. Of these, 48 234 wrote two or more subjects compared to 49 153 last year. For those who wrote two or more subjects, 40 842 obtained Grade E or better. This translates to 84,67 percent pass rate,” revealed Zimsec recently. This year’s A-level results came three weeks earlier than those of the 2020-2021 examination.
