The Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile is making a return after not being staged in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Looking at their qualifying times, the majority of them need to improve their speed because they are slow compared to the previous qualifiers. Maybe because it has been a long time without participating in this event. If they continue working hard on speed we are going to see an improvement.  “We are still in discussion with the sponsors over prize money, but the athletes are excited to be back taking part in this competition,” said Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Watson Madanyika. The Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile final will be held at the ZITF Main Arena on April 30. The next qualifying event will be held on Independence Day at White City Stadium before it moves to Gwanda on April 23. – @innocentskizoe
