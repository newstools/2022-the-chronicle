LOCAL film producers Jewels Embryonic Studios and Snipper Shoot are set to premiere a new movie titled iGAZi: Spirit of a Good Heart next month. The producers who are behind the drama series Love Lies will premiere iGAZI at Ster-Kinekor cinemas in Bulawayo.
Filmmaker, writer and CEO of Jewel Embryonic Studios Linos Tapera said the full-length movie is meant to expose the evil that comes with the love for money and lust. <img class="alignnone wp-image-603643 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/iGAZi-Spirit-of-a-Good-Heart-crew-on-set-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/iGAZi-Spirit-of-a-Good-Heart-crew-on-set-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/iGAZi-Spirit-of-a-Good-Heart-crew-on-set-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “This movie brings to light the negative implications of loving money and also lust. It’s meant to expose the danger of child negligence done by parents. I realised that this is the very reason why children fight with each other and make wrong decisions in life. “Most of that is done by fathers, especially if a child born out of wedlock is involved. Ill-treatment of such children leads to hate, tension and revenge,” Tapera said. The film, shot at Njube and Mpopoma suburbs as well as other Western suburbs, is full of ghetto vibes with low-density suburbs adding a little bit of uptown flavour. Tapera said the idea behind this was to offer entertainment to different classes of people. <img class="size-full wp-image-595243" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Linos-Tapera.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Linos-Tapera.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Linos-Tapera-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> CEO of Jewel Embryonic Studios Linos Tapera “The idea behind shooting at different places makes the movie appeal to people in the hood and those from low-density areas. It’s all-inclusive,” he said. Written and directed by Tapera and Tanaka Munyavhi, the film was filmed by Eric Nyai. The storyline takes one on an evil path of drug abuse and ill-treatment of children, ultimately leading to the death of a father as revenge for ill-treating a child born out of wedlock.  Tapera said exhibiting the movie at Ster-Kinekor alone will not be enough so they have plans to sell it to broadcasters. “After the launch, the movie will be sold to any channel that’s willing as long as it has a good offer for our quality work so that we’ll be able to fund the next project. I think it’s high time we invest in our own local productions,” he said. – @eMKlass_49
