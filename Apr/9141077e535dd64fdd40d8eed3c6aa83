The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter YOUNG Sables coach Shaun De Souza is confident they can upset favourites Namibia in the final of the Barthes Trophy in Nairobi, Kenya, on Sunday. The Under-20 side booked their place in the final following a 32-3 victory over Madagascar on Wednesday. “Definitely a game not to miss. <img class="alignnone wp-image-485639 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/rugby-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/rugby-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/rugby--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We have a long time rivalry in which Namibia have the upper hand so going into this final as underdogs gives us the drive to do our best. We are currently doing a video review of our game and we will also review the Namibia games and then tomorrow’s training session we will implement strategies for the final on Sunday,” De Souza said. “Our semi-final was tough. It was a game in which the boys let emotions take over and we received a red card. We played close to 30 minutes of the game with 14 men, but managed to defend well to keep Madagascar from scoring. Against Tunisia in the quarter-final, the boys were very nervous and had stage fright, but managed to clinch the win in the last two minutes of the game and won 19-18. Generally, I am happy with what they have done.” De Souza says the road to where they are now has not been easy. “The journey has been tough without any resources and financial assistance. We put together a high performance Under-20 group where we did talent identification from across the country which was not easy because schools had not played rugby for two years. “We started by getting our high performance centre Under-20 sevens team to play in the sevens tournaments where they did reasonably well for outstanding, which was our building block. We then changed focus to the Rugby Africa Under-20 Barthes trophy and put a team in the Nedbank Challenge Cup where we lost two games and won one. “That was all part of the pathway to final selection. We unfortunately lost players through injury, but I guess those things will happen in a contact sport.  We then selected a 30-man squad and went into camp. We then selected the final 25 to travel from there,” De Souza said. Squad Forwards: Tomuvonga Msasanure (vice-captain), Tadiwa Chinwada, Farai Madzima.
