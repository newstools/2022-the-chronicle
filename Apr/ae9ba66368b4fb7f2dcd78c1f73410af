NATIONAL Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) president Arthur Maphosa says they are more than ready for the long overdue return of schools’ sport in the second term due to start on Tuesday. The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) indicated that it was eager to facilitate the return of schools’ sport in the second term so that the country’s junior team representatives, who are learners, can start preparations for international tournaments to be held this year. Maphosa said they are only awaiting the greenlight from the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to get the ball rolling.  “We are as ready as we have been when having examinations, which have been successfully carried out. There is no way we can fail to have sporting activities at this moment. We have written again to our principals and told them we are ready to resume sport. “We have explained to them that the kids are lagging behind and what is painful is we see kids from other countries at international competitions, yet we are doing nothing. We are creating a generational gap in terms of our sport,” said Maphosa. “Sport is a paying industry as we speak and we cannot keep ignoring it under the cover of Covid-19. We have to learn to live with it as a pandemic. We are eager to return to activities, the students and the heads. Sport is to the benefit of the children, who are the future leaders of tomorrow. “Both Nash and Naph have been lobbying for the return of schools’ sport now that most of the children from 12 years and above have been vaccinated. We are saying protection is there and we can guarantee a safe return to activities,” he said. Schools’ sport plays a huge role as a talent nurturing ground and feeder system for the country’s professional sporting disciplines. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604254 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National schools’ competitions have over the years been a good ground for talent identification and some have ended up in professional ranks locally and abroad. National competitions such as the Copa Coca-Cola, Nash and Naph athletics competitions have been a stepping stone for a number of athletes that have gone on to make it big in the industry. Schools’ sport also plays a huge role as a talent nurturing ground and feeder system for the country’s professional sporting disciplines. – @innocentskizoe.
