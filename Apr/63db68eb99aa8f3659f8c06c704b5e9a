THE Young Sables secured a place in the final of the Barthes Trophy underway in Nairobi, Kenya, after beating Madagascar 32-3 in a semi-final encounter played  yesterday. The emphatic victory means the Zimbabwe Under-20 rugby side will now face Namibia in the final set for Sunday. Prior to yesterday’s victory, Zimbabwe had edged Tunisia 19-18 in the quarter-finals. Namibia on the other hand smashed Cote d’Ivoire 62-0 in the quarter-finals before a 16-5 victory over Kenya in the semi-finals. Zimbabwe are among eight teams competing for the Rugby Africa Under-20 Barthes Trophy.  Other countries are Madagascar, Tunisia, Namibia, Zambia, Cote d’Ivoire, Zambia and hosts Kenya. The Barthes Trophy is a top priority for the Young Sables as winners earn the right to represent Africa in the World Rugby Junior Trophy. Zimbabwe last featured in the second tier World Rugby competition for Under-20s when the country hosted the tournament in 2016. Before that, Young Sables had qualified for three successive editions of the competition from 2010 to 201 — @lnnocentski
