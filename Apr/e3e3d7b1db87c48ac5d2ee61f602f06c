The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief
HARVESTING of maize is in full swing in most parts of the Midlands province amid concerns that the maize could be affected by the prevailing wet spell.  In an interview yesterday, acting Midlands Provincial Director, Agriculture and Rural Development, Mrs Madeline Magwenzi, said farmers were harvesting an average of five tonnes per hectare which is a drop from last season’s average which was about 10 tonnes. She said in some parts of the province, the maize crop was a writeoff following the prolonged dry spell in February. “Maize harvesting is in full swing and about 80 percent of the crop has been harvested. The maize planted under Pfumvudza/Intwasa did well in many areas despite the prolonged dry spell in February,” said Mrs Magwenzi. She however, said there are fears that the rains received recently in most parts of the province could affect the quality of maize. On potato harvesting, Mrs Magwenzi said 75 percent of the crop has been harvested. “The province had 40 hectares under tobacco and the tobacco is now at the auction floors,” she said. Mrs Magwenzi said soon after harvesting, farmers start preparing for the winter wheat planting. “It’s quite refreshing that for the first time in many years we are confident of a timely start to the winter wheat planting,” she said. Mrs Magwenzi said the province expects to put 6 500 hectares under winter wheat this year.
