The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Chronicle Reporter CHIEFS have said the country’s Independence has helped preserve cultural values and traditions which were eroded during colonial rule. During the colonial era, the white regime introduced their culture to dilute indigenous values and practices. <img class="wp-image-592690 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-12-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Masendu The authority which had been given to traditional leaders in the past was compromised. Some heritage sites in the country which were known to be sacred were tampered with. After attaining independence, the country has made significant efforts to fight white hegemony and amplify its cultural norms and values. On Monday the country celebrates 42 years of independence with the main celebrations set to be held in Bulawayo. Chiefs said each year they celebrate the day with pride knowing that it played a crucial role in their reinstatement as custodians of traditional values. Chief Bango from Mangwe District urged people to come out in numbers to celebrate the day. He said the district celebrations will be held in Brunapeg. “Attaining our Independence has helped us to retain our identity in the form of our culture. During the colonial era whites suppressed us as well as our cultural values. They wanted to replace our traditional values and norms with white culture. Under their rule we slowly lost our identity and in the process our spirit of ‘Ubuntu’. “Traditional leaders were not recognised by the white regime and their authority was taken away from them. Sacred places were tampered with. After Independence we have seen great change as Government has made significant efforts to retain authority of traditional leaders.” He said traditional and cultural beliefs were important as they kept society intact and in harmony with the ancestors. Chief Bango said even in a modernised set up like today, tradition should not be overlooked. He said some things were not going well today because sacred places like Njelele in Matobo had been interfered with. Chief Masendu from Bulilima District said the Constitution now gives rightful recognition to traditional leaders and sacred sites. He said Chapter 15 of the Constitution emphasises the importance of culture and heritage. Chief Masendu said minority languages have also been recognised as part of culture preservation. “We thank the Government for the recognition that we have been given as traditional leaders. This has also helped to ensure that various arms of Government and even the private sector recognises our role in society. The Constitution has also recognised certain heritage sites like Njelele as sacred places.  The primary courts held by headmen and the community courts that we hold as chiefs have also been recognised,” he said. Chief Masendu added: “Today, minority languages like Kalanga are being recognised, which is a sign of preservation of our culture as black people. During the colonial era chiefs were reduced to just puppets as they didn’t have any governing power.” He said Independence Day district celebrations in Bulilima will be held in Khame area. Chief Sitaudze in Beitbridge District said traditional leaders also played a role in the attainment of independence. He said it was pleasing that Government was now prioritising their welfare. Chief Sitaudze said cultural centres have been set up across the country, which was a sign that Government knew the importance of cultural values within society. He urged people to come in numbers to celebrate the achievements of Independence. “If we look at the gains we have recorded after Independence, you will realise that they cut across and no one has been left out. From the leadership moving down to grassroots we all have a reason to celebrate our Independence,” he said. – @DubeMatutu
