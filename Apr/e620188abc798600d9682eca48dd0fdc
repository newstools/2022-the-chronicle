TWO Upper Six pupils from Bulawayo’s Petra Senior College, have developed a unique online application called ‘Developing on Que (DOQ) that enables individuals to advertise their professional skills and companies to identify the individuals with skills they want. The duo, Danielle Kangausaru and Qhelokuhle Dube, are both junior councillors in the City of Bulawayo and are exhibiting at the council’s pavilion at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-568413" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-20-at-16.01.20-e1632148049358.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="453" /> They told Chronicle in an interview yesterday that the new app aims at decreasing the unemployment rate among the youths as it makes it easy for them to advertise their professional skills. “This application is a platform for youths to find jobs as you can see its catchphrase ‘for youths by youths’. “We realised that as you wait for results to go to college or university, finding employment is difficult for most youths hence this innovation,” said Kangausaru, who is a programmer for the application. He said they realised that in most cases the youths only learnt about the job vacancy when the job has been taken. “What we tried to develop is an application that can give you the information in real-time. Employers will also use the same application to check for the person they want,” said Kangausaru. Dube said they were working with sub developers who are providing technical support and other issues to do with security and patent rights. He said they hoped to be fully operational in two months’ time. “At the moment we have sub developers who are providing technical support and other issues to do with security and patent rights.  “We hope this application will be up and running within the next two months,” said Dube. He said in line with this year’s ZITF theme, they are trying to re-imagine, re-think. Dube said once the app is up and running, employment seekers will simply upload their details such as full names, their professional expertise and contact details while a potential employer searches for the right person by entering the skill or qualification that is needed.
