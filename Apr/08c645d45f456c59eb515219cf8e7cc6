Food and liquor delivery company, Tazine Eats is set to find a new home in the City of Kings and Queens in the coming weeks as it is preparing to launch in the city. Tazine Eats which was formed two years ago in the capital has partnerships with 40 restaurants and has unstandings with 30 more restaurants. The company also works with “dark kitchens” who are home cooks who have their clientele that needs food delivered to them. Speaking from the USA, Tazine Eats founder and CEO Kudakwashe Kachere said this concept was developed after his experiences abroad where he was inspired by the likes of Uber Eats. “I spent about 10 years in Dubai and USA and noticed how companies like Uber Eats, Door dash and Grubhub, among others operate and realised that this was a thing that Zimbabweans needed. “I then worked on the logistics and set up this company through which Zimbabweans in the diaspora can also order food for their loved ones from the diaspora,” said Kachere. <img class="wp-image-598192 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tazine Eats founder Kudakwashe Kachere In Bulawayo, he said they have so far, clinched a deal with steakhouse, The Smokehouse. “We’ve already talked to a few restaurants and liquor stores and are happy to say that they are keen to work with us. Some want us to start as soon as next week. The first contract is with The Smokehouse who have agreed on a partnership where we’ll become their exclusive delivery partner. “We also aim to be doing groceries soon in Bulawayo, but for now, our aim is to grow the brand in Bulawayo and introduce this service to Bulawayo,” said Kachere. He said they mainly use motorbikes for deliveries although they also have cars for big orders and cakes. “Our riders use insulated delivery backpacks which enable the food to maintain the same temperature as received from the restaurants to the customers.”  The founder said their launch in the city will see jobs being created for locals. “Our employees will all be from Bulawayo. We’re looking for five bikers and two customer service representatives who’ll be expected to work at our offices in the city’s CBD offices,” said Kachere. — @mthabisi_mthire
