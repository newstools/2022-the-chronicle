THE licensing of community radio stations has been applauded as a significant milestone under the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa as it buttresses the gains of the liberation struggle.  For the first time since independence the country’s provinces now enjoy media plurality and freedom of expression through their community radio channels. Last week, Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Kindness Paradza, moved around the Matabeleland region where seven community radio stations have been licensed. The visit was meant to assess the preparedness of the community radio stations to go live before the expiry of the 18-month deadline. Matabeleland South has Radio BuKalanga in Bulilima, Matobo Community Radio Trust trading as Bayethe Community Radio in Maphisa and Mangwe Brunapeg, Ntepe Manama Community Radio Trust and Shashe Community Radio Broadcasting Association, which covers Beitbridge and Shashe. Matabeleland North has Twasumbuka Community Radio Trust (Binga, Kamativi Siabuwa); Mbembesi Development Trust, trading as Ingqanga FM; and Lyeja-Nyayi Development Trust that covers Hwange and Victoria Falls. Out of the 14 radio stations that have been licensed across the country, only Avuxeni FM in Chiredzi, Masvingo province is broadcasting. The licensing of these radio stations seeks to enhance access to critical information by communities. Most of the areas where community radio stations are being established do not get signals of national radio or television stations, making it difficult for communities to access information about Government programmes and other such vital information. Mr Bbaido Ndlovu, Twasumbuka Community Radio Station co-ordinator, said this year’s independence was unique. “It’s 42 years since Zimbabwe attained independence, but this year’s one will be unique as it is the first after Government licensed community radio stations,” he said. The Binga community will be celebrating independence with a community radio station. Binga has little or no access to newspapers, television stations and very little access to radio stations. “We shall be able to broadcast in Tonga and reach all communities,” said Mr Ndlovu. In English Twasumbuka means “We have succeeded or prospered.” Mr Ndlovu said the community radio station will enable them to tell their own story as Binga, which buttresses the Government’s devolution thrust. “We are going to be able to preserve, promote our culture and uplift our societal values. We are also going to demystify myths that are circulating around the world about Binga through radio. The community radio station will empower the people after 42 years of independence and it is worth celebrating,” said Mr Ndlovu. Mr Tulani Bonani Munyandi, Lyeja-Nyayi Development Trust interim chief executive officer, which will broadcast in Nambya, Tonga and Domba languages said the establishment of community radio stations was in line with Vision 2030. <img class="size-full wp-image-599298" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Veti-Tshuma.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Veti-Tshuma.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Veti-Tshuma-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Veti Tshuma Mr Munyandi said Lyeja-Nyayi is a Nambya saying that means “Sunrise” hence he hoped the new station will help various artistes to express their talent. “We have artistes in communities who have not been getting an opportunity since 1980. The community radio stations will now play their music and help grow their careers,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-599301" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Tulani-Munyandi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Tulani-Munyandi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Mr-Tulani-Munyandi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Tulani Munyandi Mr Munyandi said the Hwange and surrounding communities were excited that people now have a community radio station which gives them a voice. In Mbembesi, Matabeleland North Province, Ingqanga FM will service the Xhosa speaking community there. Mr Veti Tshuma, the chairperson of Ingqanga FM said the Second Republic has liberated the airwaves after 42 years. “It’s a milestone achievement for the Second Republic as communities now have a medium to speak about their development,” he said. Mr Tshuma said the Xhosa community in Zimbabwe cannot wait to share with the world their culture and heritage. “They will be able to share with the entire world what is happening within their communities in terms of development,” he said.
