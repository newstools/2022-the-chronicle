The Chronicle Wedding of . . . Cornelious Dube, the son of Smart Dube and Joyce Dube of Lushonkwe; and Precious Moyo, the daughter of Doreen and Robert Aaron Moyo of Ntepe. Tied the knot on . . . March 26, 2022. We chose . . . BICC Jahunda in Gwanda for our ceremony and SKMO Lodge for our wedding reception because both places were spacious and had beautiful scenery. How did you meet? We first met at Colleen Bawn High School in 1999, but only started dating a year later.  We lost contact because we had no phones until we found each other again after 20 years on Facebook through a classmate, Bongakele Dube. In 2021, we had our lobola ceremony on April 19, a day before Precious’ birthday. A year after the lobola and traditional ceremony, we decided to get married on the 26th of March, 2022. Did you face any challenges preparing for the wedding? We enjoyed planning our wedding and our committee was very active. Wedding colours . . . Navy, burgundy, dusty pink and rose gold. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598167" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> My wedding dress . . .

Everything was perfect but the attires topped everything. The most touching moment . . . was when I turned around and saw her walking down the aisle and I knew that a journey was about to begin The most touching speeches . . . came from the maid of honour, best lady, the best man and uncle Jaivon Mpofu as they shared the life history of the newlyweds. What was on the menu? For starters, we had snacks and juice. The main meal comprised creamed samp, macaroni cheese, rice chicken and beef stew; and salads – butternut, creamed spinach, apple and raising coleslaw, and beetroot.
