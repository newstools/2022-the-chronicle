The Chronicle Luke 1:5
5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah . . . his wife Elizabeth . . . 6 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly. 7 But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.  The above scripture tells that:
1. Zechariah and Elizabeth had Christian backgrounds. 2. They were walking in all the commandments. 3. They were blameless before God. One would expect to see miracles in this couple’s life but, they had no child and were old in their age. How can this happen to such a powerful couple? This couple could have doubted God, because of their situation, they could have backslidden or better yet sought ungodly solutions to have a child but they did not! When you are suffering Delays in Life;
1. Continue serving God. 2. Worship God In Job 1, Job was experiencing negativity in his life, he lost ten children all on the same day, his wealth and everything he had, but He fell to the ground and worshipped God.
(Read Job 1:22) 3. Don’t complain/ charge God with wrong. 4. Know that God will hear your prayers and there will be a day of manifestation. 5. Give thanks to God in all circumstances God wants to assure you today that even though there are no massive testimonies in your life at the moment, remain steadfast in Him. He is doing something in your life. Zechariah and Elizabeth never complained, they still did what they were required to do by the Lord without murmuring. Sometimes God can delay because He wants you to trust in Him. There is a day when an angel will come, a sure visitation. There is a day of manifestation of your miracle. A delay is not a denial, a knock-down is not a knock-out. God can turn your lemon into lemonade, disappointments into appointments, problems into programmes, scars into stars, odds into adds at any time, develop the fruit of long suffering. God Bless!
