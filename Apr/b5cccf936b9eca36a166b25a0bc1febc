We would like to appreciate everyone who blessed the conference with their presence in the celebration of our 6th anniversary as a church. May the Lord richly bless them,” said Prophet Edwards. – @mthabisi_mthire <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603901" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KEC-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KEC-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KEC-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603912" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KEC-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KEC-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KEC-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
