ZIMBABWE National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) president, Dr Tinashe Manzungu, has applauded the Government’s renewed infrastructure development programme saying this is critical in supporting the country’s structural transformation. In a presentation during the International Business Conference held on Wednesday alongside the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), Dr Manzungu, urged the private sector to join hands with the Government. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603648" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-info-centre.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-info-centre.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-info-centre-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He was presenting on a topic: “Towards Structural Transformation of Value Chains: Perspectives from Business and Industry”. “Where there is no infrastructure there is no development. We are witnessing developments in roads and other infrastructural developments. We need to look at the fourth industrial revolution,” said Dr Manzungu. His sentiments come at a time the Second Republic has adopted a deliberate strategy to channel more resources towards speeding up key infrastructural development projects countrywide in line with the devolution policy and Vision 2030. This has seen the Government funding key infrastructure projects such as road rehabilitation, building and upgrading of dams, clinics, schools, airports and hospitals. The focus also covers construction of public offices and new energy projects.  The thrust is also in line with the rural industrialisation being spear-headed by Government. To speed up structural transformation, he said focus should be given to addressing finance issues and the quality of labour on the market and challenged tertiary institutions and research organisations to play their part. “We need to focus on issues, which have to do with finance and skills gaps. We must avoid skills gap,” said Dr Manzungu. “Private sector participation in the designing and implementation of upscaling programmes will enhance the availability of high-quality labour and the creation of decent jobs.” A Government-commissioned audit last year revealed that the country has a serious skills deficit of up to 62 percent despite having one of the highest literacy rates in the world. The audit said although Zimbabwe’s literacy rate is at 94 percent, the national skills level is a mere 38 percent on average with some sectors having a skills gap of up to 95 percent. <img class="wp-image-604362 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-30-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-30-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-30-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira has said the nation was struggling with a 95 percent skills deficit in the medical sector and 94 percent skills gap in the engineering sector, a situation that was affecting service delivery and economic growth.
