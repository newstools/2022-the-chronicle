TITLE chasing Chicken Inn FC should expect a tightly contested affair when they take on table anchors Bulawayo City in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Luveve Stadium this afternoon.  Both sides go into today’s encounter licking wounds following losses in their last games. Chicken Inn were humbled 3-0 by Whawha, who had gone into the match at the bottom of the table, but leapfrogged City, who were dismissed 0-2 by FC Platinum. The defeat to Whawha left Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas fuming as he had spent the build-up to the game emphasising on the need to guard against complacency. <img class="size-full wp-image-599638" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Joey-Antipas-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas It is the same message that Antipas has been feeding his charges not to underrate their city opponents, as they might suffer a second consecutive defeat. On paper, Chicken Inn are by far stronger than City, who are driven by a group of unheralded youngsters. Derbies are tricky and Chicken Inn should be aware of dangers posed by City, who are fighting for survival. With a third of the season’s matches played, Chicken Inn are second on the log, tied on 23 points with leaders Dynamos, who have a superior goal difference after 11 outings, while City sit on six points, four away from safety. Chicken Inn have been playing a 3-5-2 formation when attacking, and it folds to a 4-4-2 system when defending. The three central defenders, skipper Moses Jackson, Nielson Ketala and Itai Mabhunu have been resolute at the back, with Shepard Mhlanga, Richard Hachiro and Brett Amidu pulling strings in central midfield, while Michael Charamba and Xolani Ndlovu occupy the wings. <img class="size-full wp-image-493492" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Xolani-Ndlovu-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Xolani-Ndlovu-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Xolani-Ndlovu-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Xolani Ndlovu Ndlovu occasionally drops back when the side is under attack. Upfront, Brian Muza and Munashe Pini are likely to be trusted to open up City’s defence. City are likely to give young goalkeeper Reward Muza a start ahead of Bhekimpilo Ncube, who made bad calls which cost the local authority side points against FC Platinum. Mpumelelo Bhebhe, Vincent Moyo, Wilfred Munorwei and Lewis Ncube will form City’s defence with former Under-20 utility player Lesley Lunga starting in a central midfield that has Melikhaya Ncube, Crispen Machisi, Elshamar Farasi and Douglas Sibanda, while Nqobile Ndlovu leads their attack. <img class="size-full wp-image-598847" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/BULAWAYO-City-FC-winger-Wilfred-Munorwei.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/BULAWAYO-City-FC-winger-Wilfred-Munorwei.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/BULAWAYO-City-FC-winger-Wilfred-Munorwei-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> BULAWAYO City FC winger Wilfred Munorwei Mwaruwari is still searching for his first victory, having collected two points in two games from draws against Bulawayo Chiefs and Dynamos. ZPC Kariba are dangerously hoovering above relegation in 14th place with 10 points and go into the game smarting from a 2-1 defeat to Black Rhinos. Having only been with the team for four weeks, the Undertaker might have instilled his philosophy to his players and it remains to be seen if they will switch off the power generators in their backyard.
