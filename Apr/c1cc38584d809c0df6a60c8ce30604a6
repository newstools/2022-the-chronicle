SOUTH African and Zimbabwean authorities have resumed joint efforts to revive the implementation of the Trans-Limpopo Spatial Development Initiative (TSDI). The initiative is aimed at promoting economic growth in South Africa’s Limpopo and Zimbabwe’s Matabeleland provinces, which form a key trade artery for the region. Using their strategic locations and strong social ties, the two countries could use their collective resources to integrate their economies. Already a team of South Africans is in Zimbabwe to explore opportunities at the ongoing Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) . <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603706" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-31-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-31-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-31-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In an interview on Monday, soon after discussions with authorities at Beitbridge Municipality, Limpopo Provincial Government head of delegation Matodzi Rathumbu said they were ready to revive the initiative within the TSDI corridor. “We have come here with economic development agencies from the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone (MMSEZ) to explore economic development opportunities. So, our first stop before we get to ZITF was the Beitbridge-Municipality, where we have engaged the mayor and his team. “They have showcased the investment opportunities that they have including the SEZ in Beitbridge, which we have visited, and we are also interested in the possibilities  of getting water for our SEZ from Zimbabwe,” he said. Mr Rathumbu said Zimbabwe had a lot of water bodies, which could help boost the economic activities within the TSDI corridor. He said South Africans were exploring the possibility of getting more water from the Zhovhe Dam to drive the MMSEZ in Limpopo Province. “We believe that from time to time under the TSDI, we ought to do the exchange programmes with our Zimbabwean counterparts in areas of mutual benefit. Today’s engagement is one of those steps and we are going to maintain the momentum,” said Mr Rathumbu. The chief executive officer of the Musina Makhado Special Economic Zone (MMSEZ), Mr Lehlogonolo Masoga said, water was a critical component for economic development hence plans to boost water supplies by getting some of the water from Zimbabwe. <img class="size-full wp-image-603718" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-33-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-33-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-33-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The chief executive officer of the Musina Makhado Special Economic Zone (MMSEZ), Mr Lehlogonolo Masoga He said South Africa could benefit more from the water from north of the Limpopo River while Zimbabwe could benefit from other facilities offered by South Africa that drive economic growth. “We think that we should be connected as one community that’s only divided by a river. One of the major benefits for us is water and when this water passes through Beitbridge town, it will have some spillover effects,” said Mr Masoga. “So, it is critical that as government officials from both sides, we strengthen ties and collaborations and exchange notes on how to grow economically together. “For us in Limpopo, Beitbridge should be used as a soft landing for investment in Zimbabwe and we will also reciprocate for Zimbabweans in our province,” Musina Municipality Manager, Mr Nathi Tshiwanammbi said his council was finalising a Memorandum of Understanding for a twinning agreement with the Beitbridge municipality. “Our challenges are the same because of our location in the international trade corridor hence we need to find ways to collaborate,” said Mr Tshiwanammbi. Beitbridge Town Clerk, Mr Loud Ramakgapola said they had set aside 248 hectares for the development of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the border town. <img class="size-full wp-image-603721" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-34-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge Town Clerk, Mr Loud Ramakgapola He said the municipality was engaging the Zimbabwe Investment Development Authority (ZIDA) to create a special purpose vehicle to promote investment in one of the country’s fastest-growing towns. “We have investment opportunities in citrus production, infrastructure development, beef and related products, manufacturing, livestock production, retail, warehousing, packaging, accommodation, transport, and logistics among others,” said Mr Ramakgapola. He said recently they resolved to among other things expeditiously process business proposals from investors to reduce the red tape that frustrates economic growth.  ZB Bank has also signed a US$10 million term sheet that will enable its participation as one of the syndicated lenders in a facility for the energy sector in Zimbabwe.
