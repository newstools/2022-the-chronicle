This bias towards local content will accord local musicians and artistes in Zimbabwe a dedicated platform to showcase their talent to the Zimbabwean and global audience thus creating employment for our talented youths,” she said. The launch of the channel was met with excitement in the creative divide with artistes in attendance heaping praise on the move. Gospel singer Vuyo Brown relished the opportunities offered to local creatives by the launch of Jive TV. “This is a great initiative and what excited me the most is the 60 percent share given to local content as well as 15 percent to Africa. <img class="wp-image-572657 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/QEQE-M-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/QEQE-M-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/QEQE-M-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Qeqeshiwe This will ensure cultural exchange and strengthening of bilateral ties between Zimbabwe and other African countries,” Brown said. Qeqeshiwe said the launch of Jive TV will bring relief to artistes who need more channels to get their content played on. “For us to have a dedicated channel brings relief as we can do with all the platforms we can get. This is surely ground-breaking and we hope for more channels of this nature. This will revive the creative industry,” she said. Novuyo Seagirl said performing for esteemed guests at the launch was an honour. “I was honoured to perform for the esteemed guests in the house. This shows how far I’ve come as an artiste and being part of the ground-breaking launch was truly refreshing,” said Novuyo Seagirl.  Jive TV is part of six channels commissioned by the Broadcasting Authority Zimbabwe (Baz) last year. The other five channels include Shasha, Dandaro, Sports 263, ZBC TV and ZBC News 24 and they will be available on both Digital Terrestrial Transmission (DTT) and Direct to Home (DTH). – @eMKlass_49
