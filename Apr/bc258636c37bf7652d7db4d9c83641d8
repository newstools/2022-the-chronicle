A TWO-day inaugural Lupane Business expo targeting Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) kicks off today and it presents an opportunity to create business linkages.  The exhibition is organised by the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprise Development in conjunction with Zimbabwe Education Fund (ZIMEFU). It is held under the theme “Promoting business growth through market linkages for sustainable economic development”. “SMEs and large corporates have been invited to come and exhibit as well as establish business linkages,” said the ministry in a notice. Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Minister, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, is expected to be the guest of honour. Minister of State for Matabeleland North Provincial Affair, Richard Moyo and other senior Government officials are expected to attend. In an interview with Business Chronicle, the founder and chief executive officer of ZIMEFU, Mr Dibson Mwinde said about 80 exhibitors have registered to participate. “We are looking at more than 80 exhibitors drawn from small-scale business and big firms to exhibit. “Those from the SMEs will showcase furniture, food processing and honey products among others. We have entries from Lupane, Hwange, Victoria Falls and Bulawayo” said Mr Mwinde. This is the first exhibition since the formation of ZIMEFU in 2019. Matabeleland North provincial capital, Lupane, whose economic potential lies in agriculture, energy, mining, timber production, tourism and research, is experiencing a growing population as some Government departments will relocate after the completion of Elitsheni Government Complex. The moving in of some Lupane State University departments has increased demand for consumer services. Efforts are also being made by the Government to start exploitation of gas in Lupane.
