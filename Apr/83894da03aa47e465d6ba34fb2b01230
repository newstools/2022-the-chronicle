THE Econet Victoria Falls Marathon is set to return physically on July 3 after the last edition was held as a virtual marathon in 2020.  The marathon did not take place last year due to the deadly Delta variant of Covid-19, which swept through the country. The return of the event has been hailed by Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Watson Madanyika, who believes the popular marathon has always had fast times close to qualifying standards for international marathons. The organisers said the marathon will return as usual, with the possibility of a 2x10km relay being included. “We are planning a full marathon (42,2km), a half-marathon (21,1km) and a fun run of 7,5km, with a good chance of a half-marathon relay race being included — this still to be confirmed,” said the organisers. When the race was last staged physically in 2019, over 3 000 runners and fitness fanatics from around the world converged in the resort city for one of the continent’s top marathons. The marathon is popular for its scenic route through the Zambezi National Park.
