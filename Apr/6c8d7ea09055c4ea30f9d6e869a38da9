ALL is set for the 2022 Mapopoma Festival which roars to life tomorrow with all artistes expected in the city tomorrow morning. After the cancellation of last year’s event due to Covid-19, Mapopoma Festival organisers came up with an Easter edition that will run from April 15 to 16 at the Great Enclosure at the Kingdom Hotel. While Easter is traditionally a religious period where various denominations conduct all-night sessions and conferences, the resort city will also come alive on Good Friday and Easter Saturday during the festival. Jah Prayzah is the headline act for the festival, with more performances expected from Feli Nandi and Mzoe 7. <img class="wp-image-550831 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mzoe7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mzoe7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mzoe7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mzoe7 The festival’s spokesperson Leslie Phiri said: “All is in place for the event that will be headlined by Jah Prayzah. He’s expected to arrive on Friday morning.” In a video drop, Jah Prayzah expressed excitement at performing at his first public function in Victoria Falls, saying his 3G band will deliver a memorable experience. On Saturday, multi-award-winning Zim Hip-hop artiste Holy Ten, Dancehall kingpin Enzo Ishall, Mzoe 7 and Muffia King are expected to take to the stage. <img class="size-full wp-image-600174" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-49-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-49-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-49-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Holy Ten The event that is being held under the theme: “Lokal is Lekker/Meet in Zim” will wind down with a Music by the River gig on the banks of Zambezi River. This will be the first Easter holiday to be openly celebrated since the outbreak of Covid-19 two years ago. Early bird tickets are already sold out and organisers are expecting 3 000 revellers over the two days.  Since its inception, the Mapopoma Festival has been a great addition to the Victoria Falls entertainment calendar due to its entertainment value and pricing that is within the reach of most locals. The line-up also promotes local talent. – @ncubeleon
