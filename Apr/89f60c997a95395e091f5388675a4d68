ASK any child about what comes to mind when asked about the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) and most, if not all will mention the majestic Luna Park. The joyride, the train, the jets, the shells, the boats and the big wheel have been part of the ZITF for a considerable while, but for the past two years, the city has not experienced it. This year, the Luna Park that is usually erected a few metres from the trade fair grounds makes its return and it will be stationed at the Matopos Sailing Club, 34kms from Bulawayo. <img class="size-full wp-image-604357" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Luna-Park-Equipment.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Luna-Park-Equipment.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Luna-Park-Equipment-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Luna Park Equipment Mduduzi Mdlongwa, director of 3D Events Management, one of the companies responsible for bringing the Luna Park to the club from Harare confirmed the developments saying the equipment will be ferried by train. “We’re definitely going to have the Luna Park at Matopos Sailing Club. As we speak, the equipment is being ferried by the National Railways of Zimbabwe and, hopefully, on Sunday, we’ll have put up everything and people will be able to enjoy the rides that the Luna Park has to offer. “We’re so excited by this and we cannot wait to get started,” said Mdlongwa.  As of late, the Matopos Sailing Club has been a hit among lovers of outdoor activities who have enjoyed roller-coaster riding, speed boating, canoeing, horse riding, quad biking, swimming, drinking, braaiing and unwinding. Mdlongwa said the Luna Park was necessitated by the need to diversify activities done at the club. “Since we are revamping the place and bringing it to its former glory, we thought it was wise for us to bring something big for people to enjoy and what can it be besides the famous Luna Park? Everyone enjoys Luna Park. It doesn’t matter how old one is and since the park has been away for so long, it made sense to bring it back now. “It’s the bigger and better version of the Kiddo Land we usually have,” he said. – @eMKlass_49
