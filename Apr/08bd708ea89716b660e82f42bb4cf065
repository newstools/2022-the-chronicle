AS the country gears up to celebrate 42 years of independence, the creative sector is continuing to play its role by informing and entertaining people. This is the case with the Geraldine Roche Drama competitions, whose finale will see participants centering their productions on being patriotic Zimbabweans. Patriotism is the feeling of love, devotion, and a sense of attachment to one’s country. This attachment can be a combination of many different feelings and language relating to one’s own homeland, including ethnic, cultural, political, or historical aspects. The 2022 Geraldine Roche Drama competitions started on January 15 and groups have been battling up with qualifying groups set to compete for top honours on April 9. Six groups – Roar, Vukuzakhe, Vanity, Jabulani Arts, Tamaa and Fugitives – will contest for the ultimate prize.  Geraldine Roche project coordinator Khaliphile Sibanda said the finale will be held under the theme “Proudly Zimbabwean”. “The theme requires people to see the positives in Zimbabwe despite the negativity which kills the spirit of being Zimbabwean. We believe that if we change that mentality and be proud of our country, we can be able to take it far, to where we want it to be,” said Sibanda. She said they have introduced a people’s choice award. “The idea of the People’s Choice Award came about as we felt that audiences needed to be actively involved as they are the ones who make theatre a reality, without them we are nothing,” said Sibanda. – @mthabisi_mthire
