Dube, who had playing stints in the United States of America, South Africa, as well as FC Platinum, Chicken Inn and Bulawayo City, described Phiri as a person with an eye for talent and has been with the club since 2016. Zebra Revolution is affiliated to Zifa Bulawayo Province and has Under-11, Under-13, Under-17 and Under-23 sides. “We are trying to raise at least US$300 so that we can buy him (Phiri) a proper wheelchair to make it easier for him to manoeuvre around. Phiri is living with disability and I have known him for the better part of my life through football. He is responsible for the Under-11s and identifying youngsters as he has an eye for talent. “The reason we have him in our team is that he is a football man who eats, drinks and lives football.  We are going to have this walk for him to raise funds and also try to empower our boys to become great ambassadors in our society, so that they learn to appreciate and do good to others,” said Dube. Those interested in registering for the walk can do so through zebrarevolutionfc@gmail.com or their social media platforms. “Well-wishers can contact us on Facebook: Zebra Revolution Fc, Twitter : @FcZebraRevo or Instagram: fczebrarevo.
