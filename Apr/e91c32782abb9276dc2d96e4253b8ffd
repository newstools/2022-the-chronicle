Rapper Asaph is the latest act to be added to the upcoming Vic Falls Carnival (VFC) that will be held at the end of the month. The 10th edition of the carnival, that is running from April 29 April to May 1 at the Elephant Hills Resort, will see the Thebelele singer appearing for the first time at the event, a feat which excites him. In an interview yesterday, Asaph who hails from Bulawayo said he believes that, finally, it’s all coming full circle. “I’m really excited and honoured to be part of the carnival this year. For some strange reason, it feels like it’s been a long time coming because the carnival is one stage I’ve been dying to be on and finally, the opportunity is here. “I’m ready to represent hip-hop and Bulawayo on that stage,” said Asaph. The artiste, who recently released his first project, a single titled Thebelele under Def Jam Recordings Africa is happy about the reception the song is getting.  “So far, people love it and they’re anticipating hearing more from me. That said, I promise them more collaborations, killer performances and visuals soon. From the two events where I’ve performed Thebelele, I’ve been overwhelmed by the love shown to me,” said Asaph. Welcoming Asaph to the Vic Falls Carnival, event organisers said they are thrilled to have Def Jam Recordings Africa’s latest recruit on board. “He’s a multi-award-winning hip-hop artiste and former radio personality who has dominated the Zimbabwean music charts for over a decade. As one of the first Zimbabwean artistes to be signed by the prestigious Def Jam Recordings Africa (Universal Music Group), we are thrilled to welcome Asaph Afrika to the VFC2022 stage!” Asaph will join an illustrious line-up of artistes which include DJ Maphorisa, Kabza De Small, Sha Sha, Nutty O, K’Chinga, Takura, Master KG, DJ La Timmy, DJ Colastraw, King Her, Djembe Monks, Gemma Griffiths and Flying Bantu. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-600185" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This week, the Carnival also announced its partnership with Zambezi Lager as well as Liquor Supplies as its beverage partners. – @eMKlass_49
