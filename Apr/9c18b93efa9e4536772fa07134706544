Hara and Partners’ particulars of claim, sometime in 2021 and in 2022, they entered into an agreement with Zimnat General Insurance, the first defendant, in terms of which the law firm would provide legal services towards the recovery of Zimnat debt from third parties and other specified legal work. In terms of the agreement, Zimnat was obligated to pay legal fees for the work. Further, in terms of the agreement, it was stipulated that should there be litigation the parties can deviate from Clause Six of the agreement and negotiate the issue of legal fees. Ipec is named as the second defendant by virtue of being the pensions regulator. “From November 2021, the plaintiff has forwarded various statements for legal work carried out on behalf of first defendant which first defendant has failed or ignored to pay. It is the duty of the first defendant to settle or pay fees for the legal work carried out. <img class="wp-image-604897 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/22-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/22-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/22-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Insurance and Pension Commission (Ipec) However in breach of the agreement by the parties, the first defended has refused or neglected to pay or settle the fees with the final bill amounting to the sum of US$18 843.55, therefore first defendant is in arrears of legal fees amounting to  US$18 843.55.
