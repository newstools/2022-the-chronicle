Urban grooves, which gained momentum in the early 2000s before giving way to the dominant genre Zimdancehall will see most of its artistes undergoing a litmus test today when they take to the stage in Kadoma as they celebrate more than two decades in the industry. Some of the pioneers of the genre, ExQ, Trevor Dongo, Xtra Large, Roki, Plaxedes Wenyika, Shinsoman and Stunner are expected to serenade fans at The Odyssey today. <img class="wp-image-598210 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-29-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-29-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-29-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Plaxedes Wenyika The joint will play host to this year’s Urban Grooves celebrations that are meant to celebrate the journey of urban grooves music and keep the genre alive. The celebrations will be running for the third year. The inaugural event was held at the Harare International Conference Centre in 2020 with the second one being held virtually last year. Kayse Connect, who are promoting the show said their aim is to take the celebrations to all parts of the country. “Our intention is to take the celebrations to all corners of the country. The first show was held in the capital and last year, due to Covid-19, we held it virtually.  This year we’re in Kadoma where we’re also celebrating The Odyssey,” said Zandile Malaba from Kayse Connect. She said the main purpose of the show is to remind Zimbabwean music lovers of where the Urban Grooves journey started and to celebrate pioneers of the genre. “We’re celebrating the lives of the urban grooves artistes as well as the journey the genre that has traversed.” While most urban grooves artistes sank into oblivion after the introduction of Zimdancehall, some refused to fade and jelled in well with the new genre artistes. Artistes like ExQ, Roki and Trevor Dongo to name a few have stood their ground and in some instances, collaborated with the Zimdancehall artistes. <img class="wp-image-598211 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-31.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-31.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-31-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Trevor D Roki, who is flying high with his Patati Patata hit which featured the legendary Kofi Olomide said he is ready to show what he is made up of. “I can assure you that urban grooves will never die. We’re ready for the show where we’ll play both old-school music and the latest releases,” said the talented artiste.
