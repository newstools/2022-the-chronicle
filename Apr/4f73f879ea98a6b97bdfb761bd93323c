South Africa-based DJ Zandimaz who hails from Esigodini yesterday urged people to continue to celebrate and honour people who liberated the country from colonial regime.  Celebrating Independence Day with others in spirit, DJ Zandimaz said: “This is the day that led to many possibilities for our generation and also those to come. We were given back the privilege of being able to choose our paths and pursue what we believe in. “It’s indeed a day to celebrate and remember all our heroes who fought for our freedom and secured us a better future.” The DJ who is doing well musically is preparing to travel to the United Kingdom (UK) next month where she will stage several shows. Following the success of the We Move tour which was more of a homecoming show locally, DJ Zandimaz has decided to take the experience to fans in the UK. True to her promise of spreading the movement, DJ Zandimaz of the Emathandweni fame, said it is time she goes a notch further by introducing herself to the international community. She said the tour will kick off at Bradford on May 30 followed by Manchester the next day. She will then travel to Birmingham, Scotland and then round up the tour in Leeds. Commenting on the forthcoming tour, DJ Zandimaz said: “I’m excited by the tour which will introduce me to the world. The preparations are hectic but we’re giving it our all.” – @mthabisi_mthire
