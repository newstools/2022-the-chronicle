I call upon all operators in our media and broadcasting sector to always use their platforms for national development and the ultimate good of our communities.” The President’s call comes at a time when some hostile Western sponsored media are peddling falsehoods to divide the nation. Two months ago, the United States Embassy hosted an online talk-show where participants took turns to paint a negative picture of the country’s media environment. The talk-show was attended by “media experts” from the US and anti-Government journalists. Among the discussants at the talk show that was held on Twitter were regime change acolytes, who have a history of casting the Zimbabwean Government in bad light. The latest tool the meddlesome US is resorting to appears to be so-called non-profit journalism, which in essence is a sponsored form of journalism that aims to achieve set targets. Officially launching the inaugural Varsity Film Expo at Nust in Bulawayo last year, President Mnangagwa urged stakeholders in the film industry  to utilise their creative voices and imaging skills to tell the Zimbabwean story in a positive way. <img class="wp-image-602227 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-57-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-57-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-57-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Varsity Film Expo at Nust He noted that some players in the film and broadcasting space were using their talents and skills to denigrate their own country, its leadership and the African value systems, often at the behest and for payment by foreign detractors.
