RAIN disrupted play at the Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) regional National Club Championships qualifiers held in Gweru at the weekend leading to postponement of the men’s semi-finals. Men’s and women’s teams from Matabeleland South, Midlands, Masvingo and Bulawayo converged at Midlands State University (MSU) seeking slots in the finals. The qualifiers could not be concluded after bad light stopped play just before the two semi-final games. Lakers from Bulawayo were meant to face Falcons from Gweru while Legends, also from Bulawayo, had a date with Unicorns from Kwekwe. Winners from both matches will qualify for the national finals. Buz has opted to complete the qualifiers in Bulawayo on April 23 just a few days before the national finals to be held in the city on April 30.  “Most of the games could not be played on day one as it was raining for the greater part of the day. So, on Sunday the games started flowing, but the men’s semi-finals could not be played because of bad light. It was an outdoor venue hence we had no light,” said Francis Dube, Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) secretary-general. In the ladies’ division, Lakers Mzansi and Southern Mavericks qualified for the national finals after victories over Angels and Highlanders respectively. Mzansi Lakers won 27-10, while Mavericks scored 45 points to Highlanders’ 11. Meanwhile, BBA got a donation of a shot clock valued at €1 650 from SU Sports ahead of the National Club Championships. SU Sports is a Harare based sports company owned and managed by former national captain Taurai Chitsinde.
BBA president Sinda Mono said: “We have indeed taken delivery of a complete shot clock that was donated to us by SU Sports. This is by far a huge gesture and will go a long way in improving the quality of the game in the province.” He said the donation came at an opportune time when the province is preparing to host the National Club Championships finals.
