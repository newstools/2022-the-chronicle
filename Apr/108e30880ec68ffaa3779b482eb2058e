The Chronicle Blessing Karubwa recently in Nkayi
SIXTY Young Women for Economic Development (YW4ED) in Nkayi North, Matabeleland North Province have embarked on a brick moulding project as part of efforts to construct classroom blocks in schools in the constituency.  A target of 10 000 bricks has been set. This emerged during belated Independence Day celebrations at Sabhumani Primary School in Nkayi North on Saturday. Addressing the gathering, Women Affairs, Community and Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, who is also Nkayi North legislator, implored unemployed youths to participate in the projects. She said more projects would soon be rolled out in the constituency. <img class="size-full wp-image-572919" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Minister-Dr-Sithembiso-Nyoni.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Minister-Dr-Sithembiso-Nyoni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Minister-Dr-Sithembiso-Nyoni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Dr Sithembiso Nyoni “We worked very hard for this country to be free and now that we have gained Independence, we must now work for development. A number of youth projects have been implemented while some are yet to be implemented,” said Minister Nyoni. “I encourage the youth to grab such opportunities. Youths should start organising themselves because a number of projects are on the way,” said Minister Nyoni. She urged parents to send their children to school, saying one of the things stifling economic growth in the district is lack of education. “Parents should send their children to school. I discovered that there were 68 unemployed young people with at least five Ordinary Level subjects and above in Nkayi North. I now want to send them to colleges,” said the Minister to a rapturous applause. Speaking during the same event, Young Women for Economic Development (YW4ED) advisor for Nkayi, Ms Sibusisiwe Moyo, said they have managed to mould 600 bricks. She said the youths were inspired by the Second Republic’s mantra “ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo/nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” hence they are also determined to transform their province. <img class="size-full wp-image-603013" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Ms-Sibusisiwe-Moyo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Ms-Sibusisiwe-Moyo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Ms-Sibusisiwe-Moyo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Sibusisiwe Moyo Ms Moyo said classroom blocks in several schools are in a state of disrepair and require immediate attention. “As YW4ED, we now want to walk the talk and thus develop our own schools first. We intend to mould 10 000 blocks such that by the end of June this year we would be having classrooms constructed in selected schools,” she said. One of the youths, Mrs Sibongile Dewa (29) said the projects will go a long way in changing their lives in the entire Nkayi district. She said most youths are working hard to eradicate poverty. “We want to move on to other projects as soon as we reach our targeted number of bricks. We, however, have a few challenges in terms of our roads since we would be hiring vehicles to ferry river sand from different places to Gwelutshena Development Centre and Tsheli, our workplaces,” said Mrs Dewa. – @ BlehKarubwa
