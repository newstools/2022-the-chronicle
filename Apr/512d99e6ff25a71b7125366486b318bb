THE Treasury has been urged to utilise its reserve or contingency funding to support food insecure communities and avert possible starvation in the face of the crop failure due to poor rains.  This comes as most farmers across the country have suffered losses after their crops wilted following a prolonged dry spell. Matabeleland North Senator, Alice Dube, speaking during a Senate debate last Wednesday, Government must mobilise resources to feed people in areas affected by the prolonged dry spell. “This is going to be a very difficult year because if there is no food, there will always be disputes and criminal activities will increase. People had planted well but the long dry spell late in the season affected crops,” said Senator Dube. She said it was during such difficult times that criminals also took advantage of the situation by using those who are hungry to do certain malpractices on their behalf . “Criminals will take advantage of our situation, that people are in poverty and use them to achieve their criminal activities as people try to feed their families. “It is a difficult time and the youth will end up being used just like the girls who are asked to do things they are not supposed to do. They end up engaging in prostitution in order to feed their families at home, ” said Sen Dube. Sen Dube said some families will need food aid unti the next harvest season next year as they are not going to harvest anything this season. “We are grateful that our President has said no one will die of hunger. If it is possible, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development should help the nation with whatever resources that are available to assist the people. “They can use the reserve fund to arrest the situation which we are in. I think that will help us as a nation. We can access those contingency funds so that they are channelled towards the drought relief,” said Sen Dube.
