It was a hard-won Independence and we should always guard it jealously. Our children should also be taught about its importance,” said Ms Nare. Mr Kevin Muleya who travelled all the way from Beitbridge to be part of the main provincial celebrations said there was no looking back as the country works towards attaining an upper middle-income status by 2030. “The country is ours and there’s no turning back. We’ve achieved a lot as a country and we’re excited about what the future holds for us. We live in a free Zimbabwe because of the sacrifices made by our forefathers,” said Mr Muleya. People from all walks of life attended the celebrations together with service chiefs, politicians from various political parties, former ministers and Members of Parliament. In Matabeleland North, the provincial Independence celebrations were held at Somhlolo Stadium in Lupane, the provincial capital. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601234" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-97.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-97.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-97-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Scores of people from across the province attended and some hawkers took advantage of the crowd to do business.
