BULAWAYO will make history after being named the second city to host the main Independence celebrations at Barbourfields Stadium this year.  Since 1980, the main celebrations have been held in Harare, but the Second Republic has changed that hence the new rotation system. This year’s celebrations will be held under the theme: “Zimbabwe @42, leaving no one behind”. <img class="wp-image-513987 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Sandra-Ndebele-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Sandra-Ndebele-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Sandra-Ndebele-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sandra Ndebele Last Friday, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on State Occasions met at Barbourfields Stadium to assess the state of preparedness for the celebrations and announced the star-studded line-up of artistes billed to perform at the event.
