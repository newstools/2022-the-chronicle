The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter CABINET has resolved to extend Isiphala Senkosi to all the traditional leaders countrywide while plans are on course to expedite increasing land under irrigation to 50 000 hectares as the country targets a 3 million tonne harvest. Isiphala Senkosi is a grain reserve that is located within chiefs’ homesteads and will provide food for vulnerable members of the community. The Isiphala Senkosi programme was reserved for chiefs, but will now also cover 500 headmen and 36 000 village heads. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603765" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/139.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/139.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/139-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told a post-Cabinet media briefing yesterday that the country needs to strengthen its agriculture output to respond to both climate change and geopolitics. “Cabinet wishes to inform the nation that, with a view to ensuring household and national food security, the update on preparations for the 2022/2023 summer agricultural season have been brought forward from August to April, in order to deal with the perennial challenges around food security in the country. The Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, as well as geo-political conflicts have disrupted global supply chains for grain and agricultural inputs, with the resultant price escalations highlighting the need to intensify local production,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. The Minister said Cabinet resolved that the Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Ministry will provide fertilisers, seed and tillage services timeously. “The critical strategies include extending the Zunde RaMambo/Isiphala SeNkosi programme to involve 190 chiefs, 500 headmen and 36 000 village heads; and constant supply of electricity, water and fuel to farmers.  The Presidential Input Programme will target 3 million farmers, up from last season’s 2,7 million farmers,” she said. Minister Mutsvangwa said Government has come up with several strategies to increase crop yield and livestock production. “Accordingly, the main objective of the 2022/2023 summer programme is to sustainably increase crop and livestock production through implementation of, among others, the following critical strategies: ensuring that crop and livestock production conforms to appropriate agro-ecological regions and acceleration of the climate-proofing Pfumvudza/Intwasa Programme through training and the inclusion of agro-chemicals and water retention enhancers in input packages,” she said. <img class="wp-image-586818 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-24-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-24-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-24-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A thriving maize crop Minister Mutsvangwa said Government has already set targets for the 2022/23 cropping season. “Cropping targets for the 2022 /2023 summer season include 3 million metric (mt) tonnes for maize; a combined 467 000mt for traditional grains; 140 000mt for soyabeans; 82 500 metric tonnes for sunflower; and 350 000mt for groundnuts, with cotton and tobacco production also expected to more than double on previous production levels,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “The Agricultural Finance Corporation has opened a special window to enhance production of potato and sunflower seeds. The consumption of traditional foods will be promoted as part of the Food Systems Transformation Strategy through sensitising the population, especially the youth, on the diverse and nutritive value of traditional grains that are naturally fortified and organically grown.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-603772 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/155.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/155.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/155-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She said the 2022/2023 National Enhanced Agriculture Productivity Scheme will now fund traditional grains through CBZ Bank and the Agriculture Finance Corporation. Minister Mutsvangwa said the scheme will also cover 205 000 hectares under maize; 15 000 hectares under soyabeans; and 3 000 hectares under sunflower. “Farmers will receive funding for seed, fertilisers, chemicals, irrigation, electricity, labour, combine harvesting services and transport. Under a robust Agriculture Mechanisation and Tillage Services Programme, four facilities are expected to deliver 3 127 tractors, 56 combine harvesters, and 1 100 planters. AFC is offering tillage and harvesting services, while farmers will be able to hire a total of 245 tractors and 47 combine harvesters,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “Grain dryers will be availed in order to assist farmers to expedite harvesting and marketing during the transition from Summer to Winter cropping. The Grain Marketing Board currently has 21 dryers stationed at various depots, up from the seven in 2021.”  She said Cabinet directed the District Development Fund that Falcon Air, to be capacitated to conduct cloud seeding at appropriate times. “In the livestock sector, Cabinet wishes to inform the nation that the strategic objective is to sustainably increase livestock and fisheries production to satisfy and exceed national requirements for both human consumption and industrial use. The Livestock Recovery and Growth Plan as well as the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Plan will receive funding from Treasury as well as from the private sector. The plan will also involve genetics and access to forage and pasture, and reduction in disease-induced mortality,” she said. Meanwhile, Minister Mutsvangwa said schools will reopen for the Second Term next Tuesday as was initially planned. “The nation is further being informed that the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is currently preparing for the safe reopening of schools on 3 May, 2022 in full compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures for the Prevention and Management of Covid-19 as well as other Influenza-like illnesses,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. — @nqotshili
