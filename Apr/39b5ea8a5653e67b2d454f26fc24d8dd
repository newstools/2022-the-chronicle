FORMER Highlanders goalkeeper Edmore “Mamkhwebu” Sibanda and Obert Moyo were in charge when Chipangano dispatched CIWU 4-0 in a Zifa Southern Region division One League match at White City Stadium at the weekend.  Sibanda and Moyo were given the reins last week after the sudden departure Bongani Mafu, who was unveiled by Ngezi Platinum Stars as assistant to new kid on the block Benjani Mwaruwari. There had been fears that Mafu’s project at Hwange had collapsed with his departure, but Moyo says all is well in the coalminers’ camp. “Nothing has changed at all. Of course, we are missing Mafu, but we continue with the programme because we have a project. We just want to consolidate our position at the top (of the league table) and take each and every game as it comes,” said Moyo. The 4-0 victory moved Hwange’s points’ tally to 30, two ahead of second-placed Arenel. Hwange are yet to taste defeat this season and the campaign already seems like a two-horse race with Arenel. Although it appears Arenel coach Kudzayi Mhandire has assembled a formidable side that can fight for promotion, he still insists that their sights are not on winning the title, but maintaining their place in the league. Zimbabwe Saints’ struggles continued as they again found themselves on the losing end; this time falling 1-2 to Indonsakusa.
Bosso 90 and Ratanang could not be separated after 90 minutes and settled for a 1-1 stalemate. Results
