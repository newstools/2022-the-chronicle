TWELVE teams have confirmed participation in the Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo Province Independence tournament set for White City Stadium on Sunday. Teams that have secured slots are Swallows, Makopo, KG Queens, Lenthal Angels, Habbek, Caaz, Jess, Go Getters, Pumula Exellers, Young Queens, Amazon and Old Nic Mine. “We are calling on the Bulawayo community to come and celebrate with us and also support the girl child. Most teams in the competition are from social clubs and they need the support. This is a special day and we want to celebrate it in style. It’s a welcome development that the national celebrations are going to be held in the city,” said Zina Bulawayo chairperson Joseph Nkomazana. He said his association was tasked with the formation of a Division Two league.  The league is aimed at accommodating and nurturing players that can’t make the cut in Division One and Super League teams. Spreading awareness on men’s netball is also on the provincial body’s to do list. There is resistance to men’s netball in a similar manner that women’s football suffered when it was introduced in the country. It took more than a decade for women’s football to be embraced, but it still continues to be viewed in lesser light compared to men’s football. This is evident in general treatment of the women’s game and pay disparity at national team level where they’re paid peanuts even when representing their country. — @innocentskizoe
