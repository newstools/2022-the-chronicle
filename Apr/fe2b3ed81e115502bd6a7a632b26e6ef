The Chronicle 2 Corinthians 10 v 5 “We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.” Life catches us off-guard sometimes. A negative thought forms in your head and before you know it, you are spiralling down a dark path in your mind. In no time your mind is clouded by confusion, fear, doubt, guilt, condemnation, insecurity, anger, failure, the list is endless. Most of the battles we fight are in the mind, we are constantly going through spiritual battles mentally. We are bombarded on a daily basis with images and messages from the world that seek to control and paralyse us.  The devil’s greatest desire is to confuse and lie to us through filling our minds with destructive thought patterns. He understands the power of the mind so he invades it and fills it with negative thoughts that lead us down a path of defeat, making us ineffective for the kingdom of God. The good thing is we have the power to fight back through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. Everyday we can choose to offload the baggage of worldly thoughts, renew our minds and find inspiration through the word of God. The Bible says we should not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of our minds. Choose to focus your thoughts on that which is pure and true, and God will give you His peace. Every single day, you have to conquer your mind and submit it to the authority of Jesus Christ. It’s not an easy feat, it’s a constant battle but you have to stand in unwavering faith, declare victory over the lies of the enemy and remind yourself that it is no longer you who lives but Christ in you and through Him, you are more than a conqueror. Be blessed.
