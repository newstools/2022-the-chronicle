This is a national event promulgated by Government and the province will be actively involved. The party will be held in Gwanda which is the provincial capital. We also have children that will be attending the main party in Bulawayo,” he said. “This event is a key part of the Independence Day celebrations as it equips children with knowledge of their heritage and their country.  The children will also be part of the independence celebrations. These children will be responsible for safeguarding our independence gains in the future and therefore they should start being taught about this national treasure today. Children shouldn’t just be taught about Independence but they must experience it as well.” He said thanks to President Mnangagwa, this year children from Matabeleland Region will have a first-hand experience of interacting with the First Family. In Matabeleland North, children will also converge in Lupane for their party and will also follow proceedings at State House in Bulawayo where the main event will take place. — @DubeMatutu
