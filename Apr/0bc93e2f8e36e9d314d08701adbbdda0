CRICKET South Africa (CSA) has named the South Africa A squad for the tour against Zimbabwe XI at Harare Sports Club which starts next week. The matches will mark the beginning of a busy schedule for Zimbabwe Cricket.  While Zimbabwe XI face South Africa A, Zimbabwe A will set off to Nepal for three one-day games and as many T20s from April 30 to May 9 in Kathmandu. During South Africa A’s incoming tour, Namibia will visit for five T20 internationals (T20Is) set for May 17, 19, 21, 22 and 24 against the Chevrons at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. That series will be followed by Afghanistan’s arrival for three one-day internationals and five T20Is at Harare Sports Club. The ODIs against Afghanistan are scheduled for June 12, 14, 17 and are part of the International Cricket Council Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League; a 13-team competition serving as the main route to qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup to be staged in India. <img class="wp-image-601990 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Andile-Phehlukwayo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Andile-Phehlukwayo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Andile-Phehlukwayo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andile Phehlukwayo The five T20Is are pencilled in for June 20, 22, 24 and 27.
