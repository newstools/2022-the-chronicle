BEE farmers and honey producers have warned the public on buying honey from street vendors saying it could be fake and pose health risks.  Honey vendors have of late flooded the streets in many Zimbabwean cities and towns thereby giving stiff competition to licensed operators. The founder of Bee’s Honey Company, Mr Welcome Bhila said fake honey is dangerous especially to those who buy honey for medical problems. “Some people will have been prescribed pure honey and end up using syrup which has high sugar content thereby putting their lives at risk,” said Mr Bhila. He said people should buy honey from reputable sources as most of that which is sold on the streets is fake hence its cheap. Mr Bhila said it is difficult to distinguish fake honey from a genuine product and consumers can only protect themselves by buying from reputable sources. “There are a few home tests that one can do to check if their honey is fake or pure but they are not 100 percent effective. If you pour honey in an open white plate, add some water and stir, it should give you the design of a honeycomb,” he said. Climate Smart Bees director Miss Wendy Mtisi said fake honey sellers were putting the lives of customers at risk. Ms Ntombizodwa Ndlovu who sells honey along 5th avenue conceded that some street vendors were selling fake honey. “Yes, some people are selling honey mixed with syrup claiming its pure honey. This is unfair because some of our customers buy the honey for health reasons,” she said. -@sikhulekleaniM1
