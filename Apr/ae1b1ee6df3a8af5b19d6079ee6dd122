Paratroopers jump out of airplanes and use parachutes to land safely on the ground. This is one of the three types of “forced entry” strategic techniques for entering a theatre of war; the other two being by land and by water. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601234" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-97.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-97.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-97-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Their tactical advantage of entering the battlefield from the air is that they can attack areas not directly accessible by other transport. The ability of air assault to enter the battlefield from any location allows paratroopers to evade emplaced fortifications that guard from attack from a specific direction. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601231" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-98.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-98.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-98-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The possible use of paratroopers also forces defenders to spread out to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe. Another common use for paratroopers is to establish an airhead for landing other units, as at the Battle of Crete.
