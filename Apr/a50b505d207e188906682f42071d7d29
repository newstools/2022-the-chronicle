THE manufacturing sector should wean itself from import dependence as this is unsustainable for the economy, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) president, Mr Kurai Matsheza said yesterday. Speaking during the Zimbabwe International Business Conference, organised on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), Mr Matsheza called for a quick shift of focus towards upscaling local products value addition. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604140 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/mANYAJUN8HTO9P-GH.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/mANYAJUN8HTO9P-GH.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/mANYAJUN8HTO9P-GH-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Government is already pushing the drive towards improving investment in domestic value addition and beneficiation under its US$8 billion Industry and Commerce Roadmap. This is critical under Vision 2030 where the Second Republic is targeting to grow the economy to an upper-middle-income economy with a Gross Domestic Product per capita of US$3 500 from US$1 720 in 2018. The Government has already started implementing the National Development Strategy (NDS 1), which runs from 2021 to 2025 with a focus on stimulating productivity across the economy. In that regard, Mr Matsheza said local industries should produce goods that dominate the local market in order to guard against global shocks. “When you look at the six contributors to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP); agriculture, mining, manufacturing, wholesale, information, finance and insurance, the biggest is the wholesale sector,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604143" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-7-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-7-14.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-7-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The manufacturing sector is lagging. This is an issue because the manufacturing sector should take the lead.” In his presentation anchored on the theme: “Towards Structural Transformation of Value Chains: Perspectives from Business and Industry” Mr Matsheza said none of the economic sectors can stand alone while relying on imports. “They are import-dependent. If you look at the motor, telecom equipment and medical appliances, it’s highly import-dependent,” he said. “As an industry, we need to change this scenario. This is not sustainable. We cannot be dependent on imports to grow the manufacturing sector. “If we don’t focus on value chains, we won’t come right. In terms of structural transformational value chains, we need to transition from low productivity and labour-intensive economic activity to higher productivity and skills activity.”  As part of measures to replace imports, Mr Matsheza said the local value chain must dominate local industries. “Value chains should be dependent on local linkages. Domestication of value chains is key to transforming the economy,” said Mr Matsheza. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already come up with sector-specific strategies to deal with the operational bottlenecks and enhance the ease of doing business. These include the Leather Sector Strategy, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Strategy and Five-Year Fertiliser Import Substitution Roadmap. More than 600 local and international delegates attended the conference held under the ZITF theme: “Rethink, Reimagine, Reinvent Value Chains for Economic Development”. Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga officially opened the conference. <img class="size-full wp-image-604144" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga
