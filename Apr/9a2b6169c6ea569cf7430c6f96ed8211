GOVERNMENT has approved the Zimbabwe Public Sexual Harassment Policy as part of measures to improve ambience at work stations and tackle sexual harassment in the workplace.  The policy is in compliance with the Constitution of Zimbabwe, the Public Service Act, the Sexual Offences Act, the Public Service Regulations 2000 and Circulars and Procedures. The policy is underpinned by the following principles: to combat sexual harassment in the public service, to provide a safe working environment that is free from sexual harassment, to support diversity and inclusive work practices, to promote respect among all people in the workplace and to encourage fair and equitable treatment of all people in the workplace. Other principles include putting in place mechanisms for redress in cases of sexual harassment in the public service and to inform all members that if allegations of sexual harassment are levelled and substantiated against them, they are liable for such actions. <img class="wp-image-588832 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Sexual-harassment.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Sexual-harassment.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Sexual-harassment-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sexual harassment (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  In his post-Cabinet briefing yesterday, acting Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Jenfan Muswere said going forward all quasi-public sector entities will be directed to develop sexual harassment policies in line with the Zimbabwe Public Sexual Harassment Policy, while issues of sexual harassment will be incorporated into the Public Service Act, the Health Service Act and the relevant Statutory Instruments. “Cabinet considered and approved the Zimbabwe Public Sexual Harassment Policy as presented by the Chairperson of the Cabinet Committee on Social Services and Poverty Eradication, Honourable Paul Mavima. <img class="wp-image-593053 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Minister-Professor-Paul-Mavima.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Minister-Professor-Paul-Mavima.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Minister-Professor-Paul-Mavima-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Professor Paul Mavima Cabinet reports that the Government of Zimbabwe is committed to creating a conducive public service workplace environment free from sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse,” he said. “This is with a view to ensuring the protection of the dignity of workers’ in the public service and maximum work productivity for efficient and effective service delivery.” Minister Muswere said the elimination of gender-based violence and harassment in the workplace is thus central to the attainment of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)5 on gender equality through elimination of barriers that hinder the full participation, empowerment and progress of public servants in the workplace. He said Cabinet also approved a report on the hosting of the National Languages Conference from June 7-9, 2022, at the Elephant Hills Hotel in Victoria Falls. The report was presented by Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kirsty Coventry. <img class="wp-image-512258 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Kirsty-Coventry.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Kirsty-Coventry.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Kirsty-Coventry-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Kirsty Coventry “The nation is informed that the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation intends to host a National Languages Conference under the theme, ‘Harnessing and promoting our national languages for inclusive citizenship and shared development towards Vision 2030,’” said Minister Muswere. The National Languages Conference seeks to define in detail the role and place of all officially-recognised and not yet recognised indigenous languages in national development as well as the promotion, preservation and conservation of cultural heritage. — @mashnets
