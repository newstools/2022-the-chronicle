ZIMBABWE Revenue Authority (Zimra) acting Commissioner-General Ms Regina Chinamasa has said the Border Efficiency Management Systems (BEMS) at Beitbridge Border Post has started showing signs of improvement following the opening of a new freight terminal in October last year. The freight terminal is part of the US$300 million massive infrastructure project, which the Government is implementing in partnership with the Zimborders Consortium under a 17 and half-year build, operate and transfer (BOT) arrangement. The project is being rolled out in three phases. The freight terminal, ICT facilities and roads are under the first phase while the buses and light motor vehicles terminals are part of phase two. <img class="wp-image-600187 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zimra-director-of-ICT-Mr-Shami-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zimra-director-of-ICT-Mr-Shami-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Zimra-director-of-ICT-Mr-Shami-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimra director of ICT, Mr Shami Moyo Under the third phase, there are offsite works, which include the construction of 220 staff houses, 11,4 megalitre water reservoir, a fire station, an animal quarantine plant and the upgrading of the border town’s water and sanitation facilities. In an interview on the sidelines of #I’mForZero” breakfast meeting with stakeholders in the border town, Ms Chinamasa said the upgrading of Beitbridge and other ports of entry and exit was long overdue. “Discussions around the modernisation of the Beitbridge Border Post and other ports of entry and exit is something that has been spoken about for over a decade. “When we see it coming into fruition, it then helps us to meet our mandate of revenue collection and the facilitation of trade and travel,” she said. “As Zimra, we have been inundated with issues of corruption and inefficiencies, and largely the infrastructure challenge was causing this. As we look at the progress, for instance, the new freight terminal where we are clearing commercial cargo, we are seeing improved efficiencies.” Ms Chinamasa said the separation of traffic lanes for commercial, buses and light motor vehicles had helped border authorities to address challenges faced by travellers including importers and exporters. She said Zimra had also embraced digitalisation, which plays a significant role in terms of removing the human interface, which was attributed to corruption. <img class="wp-image-600194 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Secretary-for-Provincial-Affairs-and-Devolution-Ms-Latiso-Dlamini.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Secretary-for-Provincial-Affairs-and-Devolution-Ms-Latiso-Dlamini.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Secretary-for-Provincial-Affairs-and-Devolution-Ms-Latiso-Dlamini-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Secretary for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Ms Latiso Dlamini “Once you remove them, it comes as a strong migratory strategy for us and across the globe to reduce corrupt activities. We will continue putting in place other measures to ensure zero corruption at Zimra,” said Ms Chinamasa. She said digitalisation of service is one of the major anchors in fighting corruption and urged citizens to work together and more closely in sharing vital information to curbing corruption. “Corruption and tax evasion threaten the country’s economy and the quality of people’s lives,” she said. The Zimra boss said corruption is one of the biggest non-tariff barriers that make locally produced products less competitive on the international market as well as eroding investor confidence. Zimra director of ICT, Mr Shami Moyo said the border post was being fully automated with plans underway to introduce drones, cameras and more paperless transactions. He said they are now in the process of finalising logistical issues that will enable the full-fledged use of a single-window payment system to cut on time spent by clients while waiting for customs clearance at the border. “The idea is to go hi-tech and use more of the prepayments and preclearance systems. People must spend as little time as possible when going through customs formalities at this port of entry,” said Mr Moyo.  The port of entry is relying on two service providers: Liquid telecoms and Tel-One for internet services. Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Abednico Ncube, who was represented by Secretary for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Ms Latiso Dlamini, said the Beitbridge Border Post is the artery and economic hub for all strategic economic activities in the country including the Sadc region. “To that effect, the need to eradicate corruption cannot be overemphasised as corruption threatens the quality of life, economy including our societal fabric and the future of generations to come,” he said. – @tupeyo.
