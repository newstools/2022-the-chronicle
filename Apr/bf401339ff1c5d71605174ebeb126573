BULAWAYO-based Lady Cheetahs player Robyn Mhembere is over the moon after being named player of the tournament at the Zambezi Challenge Cup competition held in Harare at the weekend. The Zambezi Challenge Cup was organised by Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) to give the Lady Cheetahs game time ahead of World Cup qualifiers at the end of the month. The Lady Cheetahs are preparing for their continental qualifiers in Tunisia and were crowned champions after beating their Zambian counterparts 12-5 in the final. <img class="alignnone wp-image-599892 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-10-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-10-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-10-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The 22-year-old Mhembere put up a good show to win the player of the tournament accolade. “Honestly, I did not expect to be named player of the tournament. It caught me by surprise. I felt l played well and I am happy that I managed to do so well ahead of the World Cup qualifiers,” said Mhembere. Mhembere said she is ready for the upcoming national team assignments. “I’m very excited to be part of the national team. <img class="wp-image-598740 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-3-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-3-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-3-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rugby ball I cherish every moment that I get to play at the highest level. For me, the goal is to score tries and possibly win competitions so that we make the nation proud. “The other young ladies out there look up to us and it is our duty to inspire them. Just to be part of the team is a special recognition for me. I know competition in the national team is stiff, but I am ready to represent my country everytime the opportunity arises,” said Mhembere. While the Lady Cheetahs finished first, their male counterparts, the Cheetahs, found the going a bit tough in the Challenge Cup.  The Cheetahs finished third after beating Zambia B side 17-10 in the third-place play-off. They had bowed out of the competition after a 17-15 defeat to Botswana. The national rugby sevens’ side is currently preparing for the Africa Men’s Sevens slated for April 23 and 24 in Uganda where they need to secure a podium finish to qualify for the Sevens Rugby World Cup. This year’s global rugby sevens competition will be hosted in Cape Town in September. – @innocentskizoe
