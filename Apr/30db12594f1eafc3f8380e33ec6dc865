She also said she wants to see a doctor in conjunction with her disease but she was already feeling dizzy so she immediately fell down. We quickly removed the shoes which she was putting on,” said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source said they phoned an ambulance, but it was too late as the ambulance crew pronounced her dead and covered with a red blanket. <img class="size-full wp-image-599779" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Woman-collapses-and-dies-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Woman-collapses-and-dies-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Woman-collapses-and-dies--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Police watch over the body of the woman When the Chronicle news crew arrived at the scene, the body of the deceased was still on the ground.
