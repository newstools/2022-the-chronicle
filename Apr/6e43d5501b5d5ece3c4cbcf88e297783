The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Chronicle Reporter NATIONAL trade development and promotion body (ZimTrade) has urged players in the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe and Kenya to take advantage of the cordial bilateral relations which the two countries enjoy and promote growth in the sector. ZimTrade chief executive officer (CEO) Mr Allan Majuru said this during a Zimbabwe-Kenya agri-trade conference webinar held yesterday. <img class="wp-image-568443 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Untitled-54.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Untitled-54.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Untitled-54-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZimTrade chief executive officer, Mr Allan Majuru The conference was held in a bid to promote synergies between the two countries in agriculture, horticulture and agricultural value chain and value addition. “Zimbabwe and Kenya should take advantage of the micro climates they have and promote export growth of agri products,” said Mr Majuru. <img class="alignnone wp-image-600006 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-37-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-37-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-37-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  He also said farmers, especially those in small-scale production, need training so that their products can meet export standards. This came after a presentation by Mrs Valerie Madzima who represented small-scale farmers during the conference. Mrs Madzima said as small-scale farmers they struggle to get a standard certification, which is a measure of standards needed for export products. “As small-scale farmers, we struggle to get Global G.A.P certification,” said Mrs Madzima. “We need to work together as a group so that we manage to export our products because as a landlocked country it is a little bit expensive to send our products to the export market.” Global G.A.P certification is a farm certification scheme that promotes good agricultural practices and the production of primary products in a safe manner while taking into account worker welfare and health and it has standards that address consumer concerns about food safety. During his presentation at the same event, Mr Liam Philip on behalf of Ms Linda Neilson the CEO of Horticulture Development Council said the two Governments should have best policies, which support farmers to meet their targets and promote growth of gross domestic product (GDP) for the two countries. He also said agriculture value chain and value edition should be done regionally.  In support of the regional value edition of agriculture produce, the Head of Regional Trade, State Department for Trade, Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade and Enterprise Development in Kenya Mr Joseah Rotech said the two countries should utilise the inter-continental free trade agreements which are there to promote free trade between African countries. Mr Rotech said Zimbabwe and Kenya have potential to grow the agricultural sector. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) represents a major opportunity for countries to boost growth, reduce poverty, and broaden economic inclusion. The meeting comes a few weeks before Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta opens the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. — @sikhulekelaniM1
