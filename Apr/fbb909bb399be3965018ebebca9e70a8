ORGANISERS of the ZITF bodybuilding contest say the event has been canned this year after title sponsors PPC Zimbabwe cited budget constraints.  Bodybuilding, Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile and Ingwebu tug-of-war are the traditional sporting events that keep visitors entertained at the ZITF. The events were suspended last year due Covid-19 restrictions and there was hope they would return this year. Only organisers of the Four-Minute Mile have confirmed that the event will be held on the last day of the fair on April 30. A representative for the organisers, Simon Gama, said: “We were forced to cancel the bodybuilding contest because we could not get the financial backing. PPC who normally assist us, could not fit us into their bugdet this year. So there was no option but to cancel the event.” The ZITF senior men’s bodybuilding show had traditionally featured men up to 75kgs but this had been changed and opened to those above this weight. — @innocentskizoe
