The Chronicle “But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”
Romans 5 : 8 I was watching this show on television where a group of investors identify these run-down houses that are in very bad condition, they buy them and put money towards renovating them and making them beautiful, then they resell them at a higher price. I could not believe my eyes at what some of these houses looked like initially and what they became after renovations. In their ruined state you would never think that they could ever be of any value, but after the work has been done on them they look brand new and they are worth so much more. <img class="size-full wp-image-603660" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KNOWING-YOUR-VALUE.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KNOWING-YOUR-VALUE.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/KNOWING-YOUR-VALUE-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: Getty Images As I watched the show in amazement, I thought about our lives and how the LORD is like the biggest investor. He sees potential and value where the world does not. No matter how ruined you think you are, even when people have written you off, the LORD can pick you up, dust you off, reconstruct you, and make you beautiful again. He sees gold in you where you can’t even see it yourself. So no matter where you are today and what state you are in, He can restore you. Do not listen to the voice that tells you it is over, you will not amount to anything; that is the devil’s voice and he wants you to believe you are worthless.  The Father who created you knows what you can be, He sees beauty and value in you and if you allow Him, He will fix you up and bring out the best in you, after all He thought you were valuable enough to be purchased by the blood of the lamb. Have faith, He will give you a crown of beauty instead of ashes. Be blessed
