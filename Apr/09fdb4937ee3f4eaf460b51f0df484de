WHEN one talks of female rappers, the first image that comes to mind are the semi-nude female chanting sexually charged lyrics, delivering vulgar charged punchlines and metaphors. Of course, an immediate picture that pops up in the minds of millennials and generation Zs are the likes of Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Lil’ Kim, Megan Thee Stallion, Missy Elliot and Lauryn Hill . . . well, those are American names and brands. Fast forward to Africa, where the game is not so fast-paced, but lyrically charged names from South Africa that immediately come to mind are the likes of Nadia Nakai, Rogue, Patty Monroe, Yugen Blackrok, Chazz Le Hippie and of course one of the most sensational showstoppers of our time, Gigi Lamayne. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602508" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-44-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-44-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-44-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Born Genesis Gabriella Tina Manney, Gigi is one of Africa’s most sought-after talents that has heads turning by the mention of her name. Gigi Lamayne is a South African award-winning extraordinaire who has taken not only that country by storm with her charismatic stage presence, versatility, and remarkably mature lyrical abilities. A versatile musician who doubles also as a songwriter and poet, she can only be described as a multifaceted artiste. In an interview with Saturday Leisure, she said that she was “the girl next door” who would like to be the big kind of a sister who always has a hand in assisting in any way possible. “I’m an academic, social activist, media personality and I’ve had the opportunity to host the first-ever music show on Tik-Tok Africa — the Africa top 40. I’m just anything you can think of when it comes to a young businessperson in the making,” she said, noting that she also does a lot of community work. “I really try to put a lot of young people on, whether it’s assisting in groceries or being a mentor,” said Gigi emphasising that she always wants to make a positive difference in any way possible. Gigi, who was born in Johannesburg said her mother was Zimbabwean. “I’m originally from Joburg, South Africa but my mum is from Zim and that’s where the connection comes in quite strongly because everyone is always asking why Gigi is always in Zimbabwe. People have seen pictures and videos and people always wonder what my connection is with Zimbabwe, so that’s how that cookie crumbles,” said Gigi.  She honed her poetic skills at the tender age of 11, having her first poem titled Valentine’s Day published at the Poetry Institute of Africa under the Anthology — Fairytale moon. Gigi later developed her unique writing skills in rap by the age of 16, drawing inspiration from the likes of Jean Grae, Bob Marley, Brenda Fassie and Tupac Shakur. “I absolutely love rapping; it allows me to tell a story. There’s always a message behind everything I do. I’ve looked up to the likes of Lauryn Hill, Lil’ Kim and Rah Digga. Nicki Minaj has played quite a huge role in terms of being one of the most iconic women in hip-hop,” said Gigi. She said being a female in hip-hop was quite thrilling. “I was dubbed one of the most sought-after females to look out for globally according to hot new hip-hop. Being a pioneer alongside Nadia Nakai is quite an honour, but it can be quite hectic because you’re constantly trying to beat the yardstick, constantly trying to go against the norm, against the grain,” she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-434706" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Nadia-Nakai.png" alt="" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Nadia-Nakai.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Nadia-Nakai-360x203.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nadia Nakai Gigi’s talent was realised at an exchange programme in the UK under the Richard Branson Scholarship programme at Stowe School Buckingham where her performance earned her the runner-up position, as well as at The DCS showdown East District in 2011 where she scooped an award. She can be recognised for her hit singles 1 Bar, Ice Cream and Lobola as well as her highly-acclaimed collaboration with the third-largest sportswear brand in the world Puma. “Currently, I have a dance song which I collaborated with Makhadzi and Busiswa. The song is titled Mashonisa and it’s quite electrifying.” <img class="size-full wp-image-596162" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Makhadzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Makhadzi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Makhadzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Makhadzi Gigi uses her life experiences as inspiration to take to the entertainment stage, to better resonate with her prodigious audience. As a way to pay gratitude to her forefathers, Gigi Lamayne will perform at The Boundary at a gig dubbed Fiva Fest. She will perform alongside Easi T.R.T and Tojey Blox.
