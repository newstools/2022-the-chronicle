IT is not everyday that one gets to meet the President, let alone donate something to him.
Such a privilege befell 21-year-old self-taught sculptor Darlington Maphosa last year when he donated a sculptured lion to President Mnangagwa.  The Riverside resident, who is the brains behind Darlington’s Royal Craft, vividly remembers the time he met President Mnangagwa during last year’s Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). The premier business expo held under the theme “Showcasing the New Normal For Business and Industry: Realities and Opportunities” presented captains of industry with a chance to network and as Maphosa was doing so, he got to meet President Mnangagwa. The President officially opened ZITF last September and Maphosa says meeting the President was great. <img class="size-full wp-image-603033" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/The-shield-donated-to-Bosso-by-Darlington-Maphosa-2.jpg" alt="" width="809" height="1080" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/The-shield-donated-to-Bosso-by-Darlington-Maphosa-2.jpg 809w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/The-shield-donated-to-Bosso-by-Darlington-Maphosa-2-270x360.jpg 270w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/The-shield-donated-to-Bosso-by-Darlington-Maphosa-2-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/The-shield-donated-to-Bosso-by-Darlington-Maphosa-2-509x680.jpg 509w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /> The shield donated to Bosso by Darlington Maphosa “I was doing my rounds as a professional sculptor and as soon as I heard that the President would be there, I made it a point to see him and it was like a dream for me. It was a mixed bag of emotions and this showed that my work was appreciated. I met him for a short time, but the memories will last forever,” said Maphosa. Maphosa was born and bred in Filabusi where he attended Insiza Primary School before moving to Somvubu High School for his O-Level education. He developed the love for art at a tender age and his first memory with sculpting was when he was eight years old. “I remember back in the day when I was about eight years old when I used to draw and carve. I used to mould clay to come up with different kinds of animals. That was my first memory with sculpture. From there, I enhanced my knowledge by practising and perfecting my craft,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-603030" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Darlington-Maphosa-with-Madlela-Skhobokhobo.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="1008" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Darlington-Maphosa-with-Madlela-Skhobokhobo.jpg 756w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Darlington-Maphosa-with-Madlela-Skhobokhobo-270x360.jpg 270w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Darlington-Maphosa-with-Madlela-Skhobokhobo-510x680.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /> Darlington Maphosa with Madlela Skhobokhobo Besides donating to the President, Maphosa has also donated a guitar to artiste Madlela Skhobokhobo as well as a lion to Venda royalty, King Mambo. Recently, Maphosa also donated a shield to Highlanders Football Club as a way of showing his support and loyalty. Maphosa is also part of a group of actors and actresses called RMDA. The group, together with Bulawayo comedian Ankela Zex, has premiered a drug abuse awareness movie titled Formula for Disaster. <img class="size-full wp-image-595282" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-6-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-6-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-6-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ankela Zex Mdawini Armed with wood glue, sand, grinder, saw, sandpaper, glass cutter, tape measure, paint, nails, wood glue and cement, Maphosa said he is ready to change the industry. “My vision is to be the best at what I do. Seeing the smiles from people I have worked with keeps me going. I have done interior design for people in Matsheumhlophe, Riverside, Khumalo, Waterford, Sunninghill and other places. This has helped me gain traction over the years. I specialise in both home and office interior design. I make plates, vases, furniture and different kinds of animals,” he said. One of the major challenges that Maphosa has faced in his trade is shortage of equipment to produce more products. “I have faced challenges pertaining to shortage of equipment. With enough machinery, I would be able to produce more, but many times, I use my own hands and this limits my capabilities. If I could get more equipment, I would produce more,” he said.
Maphosa advised fellow youths to take art seriously. “My message to other would-be sculptors is for them to appreciate art as it is a viable industry where one can earn a living. I’m doing it and so can you. I didn’t know that one day, I would meet the President, but through art, I did,” he said. – @eMKlass_49
