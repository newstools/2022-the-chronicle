The organisation was formed in the United States of America in 2007 and has been operating in South Africa, and uses football as a tool to teach young women to change their communities.  Former Highlanders FC midfielder Nhlanhla Mookie Dube, country manager for Goals for Girls South Africa, leads a team of facilitators conducting the four-day summit being held at St Columba’s High School in Makokoba, Bulawayo and ends today. “The idea is to empower the girl child through soccer by sharing life skills, leadership skills, health skills and learning from other girls how they cope with situations like teenage pregnancy and drug abuse. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604557" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-64-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-64-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-64-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We came with facilitators from South Africa who have experience in teaching kids and also invited former footballers who previously worked with Grassroots Soccer like Nomsa ‘Boys’ Moyo Christine Mpanza and Siza Khoza who can inspire these participants,” said Dube. Goals for Girls leadership summit activities are punctuated by mini-tournaments and competitions to  make it exciting. – @ZililoR
