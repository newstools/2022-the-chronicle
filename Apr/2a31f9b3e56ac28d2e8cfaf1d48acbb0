The Chronicle Although God’s perfect will is for you to succeed in all aspects of life, let me emphasize this important point concerning your financial prosperity: Debt and insufficiency are common causes of divorce, depression, suicide and murder. As a believer, you are a member of God’s family and have a royal and spiritual birth right. Romans 8:17
17 And if [we are His] children, [then we are His] heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [sharing His spiritual blessing and inheritance], if indeed we share in His suffering so that we may also share in His glory. Not only does the universe, the earth and everything in it belong to Jesus, they also belong to you and me as part of our inheritance. You were made wealthy and rich before you came into existence and you have been predestined to prosper financially. As the righteousness of God, your inheritance of wealth and riches is included in the spiritual blessings or spiritual things the Apostle Paul spoke of in Ephesians 1:5. <img class="size-full wp-image-603235" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: Shutterstock Based on Psalm 112:3, righteousness, wealth and riches go hand in hand. You have every right to be wealthy and possess material riches in abundance. The Bible says that wealth is stored up for the righteous (Proverbs 13:22). However, it will remain stored up until you claim it. Therefore claim it NOW! You possess the power and blessing to seize and command wealth and riches to come to you. (Deuteronomy 8:18) Exercise that power by speaking faith filled words daily and taking practical steps to eradicate debt and lack. Like God, you can speak spiritual blessings into existence.  Romans 4:17 tells us that God, “calls those things which do not exist as though they did.” Remember, doubt keeps silent, but faith speaks! Confession and claiming it connects you to your blessing. Your tongue has power of life and death. Proverbs 18:20–21 “A man’s stomach shall be satisfied from the fruit of his mouth, and from the produce of his lips he shall be filled. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (KJV).
