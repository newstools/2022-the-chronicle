THE Department of Veterinary Services is on high alert for transboundary animal diseases as the country strengthens its biosecurity measures in order to produce premium livestock. This is expected to widen access to lucrative export markets, support livelihoods and provide food and nutrition security. Government, in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the European Union have operationalised the Sadc Regional Agricultural Policy Project (STOSAR) to deliver animal health assistance and support to curb high impact transboundary animal diseases. To curb high impact regional transboundary animal diseases that include foot and mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the STOSAR project has delivered animal health assistance and support to 16 Sadc member states including Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-600449 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/FAO’s-sub-regional-coordinator-for-Southern-Africa-Mr-Patrice-Talla.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/FAO’s-sub-regional-coordinator-for-Southern-Africa-Mr-Patrice-Talla.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/FAO’s-sub-regional-coordinator-for-Southern-Africa-Mr-Patrice-Talla-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> FAO’s sub-regional coordinator for Southern Africa, Mr Patrice Talla. The project dovetails with Zimbabwe’s national imperatives such as the Livestock Growth Plan and the Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy as the country works towards achieving Vision 2030. “Zimbabwe is on high alert for transboundary animal diseases, and we have been working closely with partners such as FAO to strengthen our biosecurity measures to ensure that the country’s livestock is at optimum health to produce high-quality meat and meat products that can be exported to lucrative regional and international markets,” said chief director of veterinary services, Dr Josphat Nyika during the launch of STOSAR in Harare on Tuesday.  “For effective animal disease control, inspection and certification in accordance with international requirements and guidelines, the STOSAR project has procured laboratory equipment and reagents and has facilitated several trainings in partnership with the Department of Veterinary Services through local technical resources persons in collaboration with regional academic agricultural centres of excellence. These collective efforts intend to improve the quality of locally produced meat and other animal products and therefore boost Zimbabwe’s export potential,” said FAO’s sub-regional coordinator for Southern Africa, Mr Patrice Talla.
