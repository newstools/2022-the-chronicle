THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) is set to rename one of the city centre roads after the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta before the start of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF).  This follows a request made by Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo in terms of the Names (Alteration) Act. The process of renaming the road comes at a time when President Kenyatta is expected to officially open this year’s ZITF.
The 62nd edition of the ZITF will be held from April 26 to 30 under the theme, “Rethink, Reimagine, Reinvent Value Chains for Economic Development.” According to the latest council minutes, President Kenyatta will also plant a tree during his visit. Bulawayo Mayor, Councillor Solomon Mguni said the renaming of the selected road should be finalised before President Kenyatta’s visit to the country. The three roads under consideration are Hillside Road from 14th Avenue to Cecil Avenue, Banff to Hillside Dams and the George Avenue from Harare Road to Old Esigodini Road. The Deputy Mayor, Councillor Mlandu Ncube said the three roads were best suitable to be renamed in honour of President Kenyatta as they are close to the ZITF grounds. “It would be pointless to select a road that is not within the vicinity of the ZITF grounds,” said Clr Ncube. Ward 13 Councillor Frank Javangwe said the issue of renaming streets had been passed in 2020 but the street names had not yet been changed. He urged council to implement the resolution as soon as possible. The Chamber Secretary, Mrs Sikhangele Zhou said some of the roads had already been renamed and said the example was Nketa Drive which has been renamed Queen Lozikheyi Dlodlo Drive.
