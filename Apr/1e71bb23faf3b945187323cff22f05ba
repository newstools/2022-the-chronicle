SELF-taught beautician and make-up artiste, Elinah Success Mangena is set to host a Beauty Masterclass and book launch in Bulawayo next month.  On May 7, lovers of beauty and cosmetology will converge at Pure Beauty Lounge in Bradfield with the aim of enjoying three events, lessons on beauty, a book launch as well as a cocktail party.
Elinah said it is full steam ahead as far as the Beauty Masterclass is concerned. “It’s basically all systems go for the masterclass. We’re just waiting for the day that’s drawing nearer. Just like class, beauty is permanent and as such, it should be cherished and appreciated at all times. “There are many beauty lessons that people should learn and these are drawn from basics such as the application of foundation, highlighting, contouring, skin care and also head wraps,” she said. The beautician feels reinvigorated after winning the Outstanding Author of the Year accolade at the recently-held Zororo/Phumulani Zimbabwe Achievers Awards (South Africa edition). “Winning an award for my book, ‘The diary of a Self-Taught Make-Up Artist’ was very motivating. I know that I’ve worked with many important people but this award is my best achievement so far,” she said. The Boss Lady, as Elinah is affectionately known, was also in line to win an award for the Female Personality Award category which she lost to Natalie Mhandu. Elinah’s last Beauty Masterclass tutorials were held in May 2018 at the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo. The Boss Lady has worked with public figures which include South African actress Mapaseka Koetle, Mbo Mahocs and Thuso Mbedu.
