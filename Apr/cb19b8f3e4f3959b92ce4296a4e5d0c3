THE Advanced Level pass rate increased this year despite low registration and Covid-19 challenges that affected the education sector. Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec) yesterday released A-level results, which show an 84,7 percent pass rate, a 3,5 percent increase from the previous year in which the pass rate was 81,2 percent.  The Zimsec statement revealed that there was a decrease in the number of students who sat for exams. “There was a decrease of 2,03 percent in the candidate entries where the total number of candidates who sat for the November 2021 examinations was 49 128 compared to 50 287 in November 2020. Of these, 48 234 wrote two or more subjects compared to 49 153 last year. For those who wrote two or more subjects, 40 842 obtained Grade E or better. This translates to 84,67 percent pass rate,” reads the statement. Results collection will be done by heads of examination centres today, while online results will be accessible to those eligible and will be available for a period of five days. “Heads of examination centres will be able to collect the results for their respective schools/centres from our regional offices on Wednesday, 6 April 2022. The Advanced Level examination results will be accessible online to all candidates and authorised personnel with effect from today the 5th April 2022 beginning at 1800 hrs. “The results can be accessed online through the Zimsec portal www.zimsec.co.zw. Candidates are advised to click on their respective region where they will be redirected to the portal on which they can access their results. Please take note that this portal will be open for 5 days only.” This year’s A-level results came two months after the examination process, which is three weeks earlier than those of the 2020-2021 examination.
