HIGHLANDERS have condemned pitch invasion by a section of fans and lashed out at “overzealous” police details for firing tear smoke resulting in abandonment of their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium on Saturday.  The match was abandoned in the 84th minute when police fired teargas into the stands after fans that had invaded the pitch had retreated to the stands and action was about to resume. At the time of the abandonment of the match, the two teams were deadlocked 1-1 when assistant referee Albinos Zigwati raised his flag to signal a penalty after adjudging that Bosso defender Peter Muduhwa had fouled FC Platinum winger Walter Musona. <img class="size-full wp-image-576625" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Peter-Muduhwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Peter-Muduhwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Peter-Muduhwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Peter Muduhwa The foul had been committed outside the box, but Zigwati flagged for a penalty. In a statement, Bosso condemned supporters for invading the pitch. “Highlanders Football Club would like to condemn in the strongest sense, the conduct of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers who were entrusted with the responsibility to provide security during a Premier Soccer League match between FC Platinum and Highlanders at Mandava Stadium on Saturday. \ <img class="size-full wp-image-602974" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-47-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-47-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-47-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandava Stadium “The club understands ZRP to be a stakeholder of the game whose mandate is to provide security for players, officials and the fans. “While the club does not condone pitch invasion and missile throwing by a section of football fans, it was unnecessary for ZRP to throw tear smoke towards fans as this behaviour ended up affecting players, officials and some innocent fans. The act was against the basic principles of crowd management and as a result, the victims were players and officials who  purported to protect. “As if that was not enough, ZRP further went on a rampage, assaulting innocent fans outside the stadium and in some instances damaging vehicles they perceived to be belonging to, and ferrying Highlanders’ fans,” read Highlanders’ statement. Bosso took the opportunity to assure their members, fans and stakeholders of their commitment to the values of Ubuntu, which encompasses ethics such as self-respect and respect for others. <img class="size-full wp-image-449506" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Walter-Musona.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Walter-Musona.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Walter-Musona-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Walter Musona Highlanders reiterated their commitment to engage ZRP in a bid to bring an end to hooliganism and violence in stadia. “We further take this opportunity to empathise with all innocent victims of yesterday’s acts of violence and condemn those individuals involved in the act of pitch invasion and missile throwing.” Meanwhile, the PSL said it will act after getting the referee and match commissioner’s reports. Acting Midlands provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende said she was not aware of the incident. “I am not aware of that incident and therefore it is difficult for me to comment on hearsay,” she said
