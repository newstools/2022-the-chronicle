BULAWAYO City coach Philani “Beefy” Ncube insists he has every reason to stay positive despite seeing his side stretching its Castle Lager Premier Soccer League winless streak to seven games following a 0-1 defeat to Chicken Inn on Saturday. Numerous missed chances in the second-half summed up a gruelling encounter which left City a top relegation candidate.  Their last and only win of the season was when they beat Highlanders 1-0 back in February and since then, they have lost five matches and drawn twice. They have only collected six points from 12 matches this season. They face neighbours Bulawayo Chiefs next and Ncube believes his side’s positives place them in a good position for the survival battle ahead. <img class="alignnone wp-image-603532 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-61-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-61-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-61-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We knew when we started that we never had players and we stuck to juniors and l feel it’s game on. Our biggest problem is that we do not have one player that can convert because we are getting chances. “If you look at the Chicken Inn game, they scored their goal from nowhere but we created chances and failed to convert; that is the name of the game. I don’t think we are too far. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603537" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-62-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-62-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-62-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> People will talk and as a coach you are under pressure, but l am looking at the positives and the project is on course,” said Ncube. City brought in goalkeeper Reward Muza and striker Roddy Sibanda on loan from Highlanders, to bolster their squad during the just ended window. Muza was impressive in the game for City between the sticks against Chicken Inn, making some good saves in the early stages of the game to deny the GameCocks several times. Sibanda, who came on as a substitute, could have scored, but just like the rest of the team, he could not convert the few chances he got. – @innocentskizoe
