AS the curtain comes down on the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), today presents a great opportunity to take up some exciting activities. At face value, the ZITF is meant for folks in suits and ties but beneath that entrepreneurial exterior is the element of entertainment. The theme of the fair, “Rethink, Reimagine, Re-invent Value Chains for Economic Development” surely set the tone for a grand finale where members of the public feast on products and services whilst enjoying good food, clothes, music and other avenues of entertainment. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604804" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This is because companies have gone out of their way to make the experience more worthwhile for visitors. The premier trade showcase is a crowd puller with a host of native, regional and international contingents converging in Bulawayo. This year’s trade fair has been one of the biggest with over 500 exhibitors showing up as well as more than 71 first-time direct exhibitors coming on board. The huge response has demanded the exhibitors to bring their A-game and to honour that, there are exceptional products and services one can enjoy. Cellular network operator NetOne is one standout stand one can visit as it offers virtual reality to its visitors. Virtual reality is the use of computer technology to create simulated environments. Virtual reality places the user inside a three-dimensional experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed in and interact with 3D worlds. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604806" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Technology is on overload as companies have come up with innovative ways to achieve tasks. Generally, when one makes a home-made smoothie, they will need electricity to complete that task but according to Zimtrade, that will not be necessary. An official from ZimTrade said the need to achieve tasks without the use of electricity necessitated such innovation. “We came up with this innovation to show people that one doesn’t need to limit themselves to using electricity to achieve tasks.  In this case, enjoying a homemade smoothie shouldn’t be hard but through this bicycle-powered innovation, no electricity, no problem. “This initiative was meant to make people reimagine and rethink how they do things. This is like killing two birds with one stone as you get to keep fit through the exercise of peddling whilst getting a nutritious meal as well. We are so excited by this,” said the official. “If you are into wild animals and are brave enough to handle a snake, then…yes, a snake indeed, you will be spoilt for choice. ZimParks, as always, is showcasing wild animals to the public so as to conscientise on the need to care and protect endangered wildlife species like the rock python.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604809" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZITF-the-ultimate-entertainment-experience-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> What’s a trade fair without cotton candy? The business expo is truly inclusive as children can also enjoy gastronomic goodies.
Children will be bereft of the Luna Park this time around as it will be erected at Matopos Sailing Club. The joyride, the train, the jets, the shells, the boats and the big wheel have been part of the ZITF for a considerable while, but for the past two years, the city has not experienced it and this year will not be an exception. Local exhibitors should get a thumbs up for their splendid displays but international ones came to the party as well. One example of that is the Indonesian Embassy which straight away caught the eye of people with their batik dress. The batik is recognised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity from Indonesia. What’s exciting to note is that one batik dress requires about a month for one to complete it! Usually, when people talk of Indonesia, they think of Bali.  The ZITF has afforded one the chance to know more about different countries exhibiting in Bulawayo. The People’s Republic of China, Belarus, Indonesia and Malawi all descended upon the City of Kings and Queens. The Indonesian Embassy is also exhibiting different kinds of foods which include biscuits, coffee, spices and other soya bean-based products. Today offers one last throw of the dice, why don’t you take a tour of the stands and surely, you might learn a thing or two. – @eMKlass_49
