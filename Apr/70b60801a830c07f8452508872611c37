The Chronicle PEP GUARDIOLA believes Manchester City will have to hold off one of the best teams ever if they are to pip Liverpool to the title.  Guardiola’s side are one point clear of second placed Liverpool after both teams won comfortably in midweek.
With six games left, it will likely take just one slip from either team to decide the enthralling race. If would be a major surprise if that happens this weekend as City host second bottom Watford on Saturday, while Liverpool play fourth bottom Everton in Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield. Guardiola has acknowledged City will have to win all their remaining matches to be sure of lifting the trophy, and that is a fitting tribute to the quality of quadruple chasers Liverpool. “Liverpool are one of the best sides in the whole of football history, we are facing one of the best teams ever,” Guardiola said this week. “They have everything, that’s why being there with them means a lot. The players know it. They’ve faced them and they know.
“We don’t have any chance to drop anything, but we have been in this position and played with this pressure.” – SuperSport
