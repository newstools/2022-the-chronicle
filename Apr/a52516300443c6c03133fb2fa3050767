TEENAGE Hadebe scored his first goal in the United States of America, when his Houston Dynamo beat SJ Earthquakes 4-3 in a Western Conference Major League Soccer (MLS) clash on Sunday. The Zimbabwe defender, who is in his second season in MLS, struck Dynamo’s third goal in the 57th minute, restoring his team’s lead as they marched to victory. Hadebe had gone forward to attack a corner, when he peeled off his marker before smashing a grounder off a poor clearance with his left foot. The Makokoba-bred footie star earned himself a yellow card after removing his shirt to show a black vest inscribed “My mother’s blessing”. <img class="wp-image-599663 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Marvelous-Nakamba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Marvelous-Nakamba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Marvelous-Nakamba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marvelous Nakamba He always wears this vest underneath his jersey in honour of his late mother. “Grateful to score my 1st goal,” wrote Hadebe on social media. Dynamo are sixth in the Western Conference table with 11 points from six games and trail leaders Los Angeles by two points.

In France, Tino Kadewere came in as a second-half substitute for Lyon, who drew 1-1 against Strasbourg on Sunday as he made his 14th Ligue 1 appearance in the 2021/22 season.

Lyon are 11th in the French topflight with 46 points from 31 games and are five points outside a Europa play-off spot. Ex-Orlando Pirates defensive midfielder Marshal Munetsi played the entire match as his Stade Reims were beaten 2-3 at home by third-placed Rennes. Reims are 13th with 36 points from 31 matches. Munetsi was making his 18th championship appearance this season.  In England, Marvelous Nakamba made the matchday squad, but was an unused substitute in Aston Villa’s 0-4 trouncing by Tottenham Hotspurs. Nakamba had been out of action for four months due to a knee injury. His coach Steven Gerrard hinted that the Zimbabwe midfielder might be thrown into the fray when they take on Leicester in their next match. “He has played for the Under-23s. He’s certainly going to be available for that Leicester fixture. It might be a bit too soon for him now because he hasn’t had any serious game time. “Hopefully, he comes through that, recovers well and then he can be back with the group. He’s been back training fully for 10, 12 days, and he’s smiling, getting closer and closer,” Gerrard said. – @ZililoR
