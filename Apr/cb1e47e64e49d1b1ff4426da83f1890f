She described the six months expo as a fairly packed journey and said Zimbabwe had clear objectives, one of which was to re-engage and engage in an effort to be part and parcel of the national programme of re-engagement and engagement. “The other objective was to get the interest of investors and also trade, increasing our trade volumes with respect to our products,” said Amb Mubi then. “We participated under the Opportunities Cluster because we were very much aware the country has huge potential and incredible opportunities in various sectors.” In that regard, Dr Chiwenga noted that the renewed investment interests were in  response to Government’s commitment to the continued implementation of business-friendly policies, as well as ease of doing business reforms. As such, he said boosting domestic and foreign investment in the country is one of the Second Republic’s top priorities, driven by President Mnangagwa’s mantra: “Zimbabwe is Open for Business”. VP Chiwenga said such positive developments, among other milestones being recorded at home, were indicative of the fact that the economy is poised to register positive growth.  He said the on-going revival of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (Zisco), which feeds into a number of downstream industries, as well as the construction of one of Africa’s biggest steel plant in Mvuma, for instance, were also expected to boost growth momentum in the medium to long term.  “The investors are confident of finishing the first phase of the programme within the next two years. “The establishment of the steel company, will result in the creation of over 6 000 direct jobs, a huge benefit to the economy,” said the VP. The oversubscribed business conference ran on the sidelines of the 62nd edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), and shared the same theme,  which is: “Re-think, Re-imagine,   Re-invent Value Chains for Economic Development”.
