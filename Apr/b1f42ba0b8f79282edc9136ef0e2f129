HIGHLANDERS’ Independence Cup preparations against perennial rivals Dynamos received a boost yesterday when midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku returned to full training after recovering from an ankle injury. Bosso will face DeMbare at Barbourfields Stadium in the Independence Cup final to be held for the first time in Bulawayo on April 18. Masuku missed Highlanders’ Castle Lager Premier Soccer League’s 2-2 draw against Cranborne Bullets and Bosso felt the absence of their “heartbeat” as the defensive midfielder has been influential in their 2021/22 campaign. In 10 games that Masuku has played, he has scored five goals and has been doing well to protect the central defence as well as commanding the midfield, giving Adrian Silla freedom to venture upfront and aid the attack. <img class="alignnone wp-image-599886 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-8-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders’ coach Mandla Mpofu is hopeful that striker Stanley Ngala, who picked up an ankle injury last week at training, and winger Ray Lunga will return to training in time to be selected for the crunch tie against Dynamos. “Nqo (Masuku) has returned to full training and is now doing contact training, which is good. We couldn’t risk him for the Cranborne Bullets game even though he was feeling much better. He is a valuable member of the squad and we wanted him to return fit.  “As we prepare for the Independence Cup, the medical team feels that Stanley and Ray might start training either on Wednesday or Thursday and might be available for the big game. As a coach, I would love to have all the players available for selection and Ray as well as Stanley give us another dimension which we missed against Cranborne,” said Mpofu. <img class="wp-image-599631 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/HIGHLANDERS-head-coach-Mandla-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> HIGHLANDERS head coach Mandla Mpofu Bosso face Dynamos, who are at the top of their game and lead the championship race with 23 points from 11 games. In terms of self-belief, DeMbare are more spurred up and if Highlanders repeat the pathetic start they had against Dynamos, they will lose to the Harare giants. Last year Dynamos lifted the President’s Independence Trophy at the National Sports Stadium, benefiting from two costly mistakes involving veteran goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda. Trevor Mavhunga gave the Glamour Boys the opening goal with just six minutes played when Sibanda misjudged a bounce from a long-range shot. Sibanda was involved in another schoolboy blunder which resulted in an own goal by Peter Muduhwa shortly after the restart. – @ZililoR
