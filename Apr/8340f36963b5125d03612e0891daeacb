THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has allotted US$30,4 million to bidders at the official foreign currency auction this week to support business operations through smooth acquisition of raw materials and other critical payments.  Despite the speculative impact of the wild parallel market rates, most businesses rely on the official forex system to raise funding for the procurement of essential raw materials, machinery and equipment. According to the latest update from the RBZ, a total of US$26,1 million was allotted under the main auction while US$4,3 million was channelled to the Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-452692" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/RBZ-680x380-15.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/RBZ-680x380-15.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/RBZ-680x380-15-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The main auction received 437 bids and 417 were accepted whilst 1 174 bids were received by the SMEs and 1 122 of these were accepted.
