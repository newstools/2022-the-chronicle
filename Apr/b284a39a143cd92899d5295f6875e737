Mr Nkomwa said the participants are being trained by the professional sign language trainers. He said participants are being fully capacitated and by the end of the workshop they will be able to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and hard of hearing and the hearing in Gwanda. “Participants will be further capacitated on basic communication skills on health matters, religious, educational, legal and other professional vocabulary as well as disability awareness and general vocabulary. We want to extend this workshop to other districts in the province,” Mr Nkomwa said. He said training of people in sign language was key in addressing challenges faced by the hearing impaired. Mr Nkomwa said people with speech impairment and hearing impairment face challenges which include limited access to information. @DubeMatutu
