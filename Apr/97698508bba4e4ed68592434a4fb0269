The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Chronicle Reporter POLICE have set up eight bases along Shashe River on the border with Botswana to fight cattle rustling. This follows a recent visit by an inter-ministerial committee to Mlambaphele area in Gwanda, which is one of the cattle rustling hotspots. President Mnangagwa set up the inter-ministerial committee to tackle rampant cross-border cattle rustling along the Zimbabwe-Botswana border in response to concerns raised during the third session of the Zimbabwe-Botswana Bi-National Commission (BNC) in Victoria Falls. The committee was given up to April 30, 2022 to contain the situation. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604239 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/PHUZA.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/PHUZA.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/PHUZA-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Theft of livestock is a growing challenge for farmers along the Zimbabwe- Botswana border. <img class="size-full wp-image-594119" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-10-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-10-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-10-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa President Mnangagwa and his Botswana counterpart, President Mokgweetsi Masisi in February oversaw the signing of several memoranda of understanding (MOUs) covering various sectors during the third session of the BNC. <img class="size-full wp-image-592502" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/BNC-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/BNC-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/BNC-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mokgweetsi Masisi The commission resolved that there was a need to expedite the establishment of base camps along the Mlambaphele Border, which must be fully resourced and be in sync with the ones established in Botswana. The inter-ministerial team last month visited Mlambaphele Border Post in Gwanda District in Matabeleland South to meet affected communities. The province continues to record increasing numbers of cases of stock theft with areas like Tshanyaugwe, Nhwali, Mlambaphele, Guyu, Manama, Mankonkoni, Rustlers Gorge and Ngoma being identified among the hotspots of cattle rustlers. In an interview national police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said significant efforts have been made to tackle cattle rustling which was rampant in Matabeleland South province. He said police recently recovered 15 cattle in Tshanyaugwe area. Asst Comm Nyathi said eight of the cattle have since been identified by a Botswana national. Mr Billy Masebola lost 73 cattle in February. “You will remember that there was the Zimbabwe-Botswana Bi-National Commission (BNC) in Victoria Falls where his Excellency President Mnangagwa met with the President Mokgweetsi Masisi and one of the resolutions was to fight stock theft activities along the border. This has culminated in the inter-ministerial taskforce on the Zimbabwean side which has been mobilising resources and coordinating operations,” she said. “These include awareness campaigns and setting up community structures to fight stock theft activities on both sides of the border. We have had an operation at the border which is a joint operation between the Botswana and Zimbabwe Police Services. This has resulted in the establishment of eight police bases along Shashe River which borders Botswana. 15 cattle were also recovered in Tshanyaugwe about two weeks ago and eight of these have been identified by a Botswana national and investigations are continuing.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-604224 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/COW.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/COW.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/COW-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The cattle rustling hotspots house notorious cattle rustlers who change the skin colour and brand marks of stolen cattle to evade justice. Some of the culprits are suspected to be working in cahoots with officials who assist them in clearing the stolen animals. In some instances, stock thieves slaughter the beasts in bushes and carry the meat. Some of the meat is allegedly supplied to butcheries while some of it is sold to the public from people’s houses. Cases of stock theft have threatened the source of livelihood for many families in Matabeleland South Province which is a cattle breeding area. The 10-year mandatory sentence for stock theft seems not to be deterrent enough as daring culprits keep breaking the law. Last year in September, police launched an operation targeting stock thieves in Gwanda District. 98 cattle and 12 donkeys were recovered under the first phase of operation “Lets fight stock thieves/Asilwiseni amasela ezifuyo/ Ngatirwisei mbavha dzezvipfuyo” which started on September 26 and ended on October 2.  Police went on to conduct the second phase of the operation from November 13 to November 20 where 51 cattle and two donkeys were recovered. The local police are now conducting operation “Asibambeni amasela ezinkomo”.–@DubeMatutu
