The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter The Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) commenced yesterday, and already, the Indonesian Embassy stand has had heads rolling with its Batik dress. The fabric which will be sold on Saturday is made of cloth which is dyed with resistant wax and is of Indonesian origin. Batik hand-dyed cotton quilting fabrics are made by artisans from Indonesia, a nation well-known for its tourist resorts. The dress is commonly worn by people for formal or casual events. In 2009, during a gathering dubbed, “Batik of the world” the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) officially recognised and stamped the batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity from Indonesia. <img class="wp-image-603871 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Batik-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Batik-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Batik-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rahma Mardina (second from left) poses with fellow exhibitors at the Indonesian Embassy stand at the ZITF The organisation further encouraged Indonesian people and its government to safeguard, transmit, promote, and develop the craftsmanship of batik.
