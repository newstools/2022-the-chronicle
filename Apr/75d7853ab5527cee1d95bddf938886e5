Yesterday, officials at the pavilion were making final touches at the stand in readiness to receive multitudes of people today until Saturday. The party’s director for  business development and liaison, Cde Francis  Hungwe said the exhibition  is tailor-made to harness the digital narrative in aiding citizens to comprehend various policies advanced by the Second Republic. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-491925" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/zitf-posb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/zitf-posb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/zitf-posb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “This year we are focusing on digital representations as we are projecting Vision 2030. The future is digital and Zimbabweans should start visualising it. “People should expect a highly digital exhibition. We will be  showcasing  successes of each ministry in terms of implementation of the National Development Strategy 1. “Economic strides that have been achieved by the Second Republic such as measures  put in place to contain inflation and various economic blueprints will be shown to Zimbabweans.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603496" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/49.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/49.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/49-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />Achievements of each ministry will be on display,” said  Cde Hungwe. Business opportunities and facilities available for youth and women are also on display. “The youths and women can apply for loans at the stand. We have bridging programmes tailor-made for small and medium enterprises not only in financing but in mechanisation. We are equipping home-based industries. “We have state-of-the-art machinery suitable for home-based industries such as incubation machines for poultry, solar, and mining. Each house should have a business, so this is the place to come and get financial assistance and business advice”. Cde Hungwe added that for the first time at the stand, the department of external relations will be explaning to people successes made  towards the international re-engagement programme.  “The idea is to explain to people notable goals that have been achieved by  Zanu-PF and Government towards  re-engaging with the broader international community, so our external affairs department will handle that,” he said. — @nqobilebhebhe
