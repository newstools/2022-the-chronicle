ANTI-CORRUPTION agencies have been commended for their sterling efforts in exposing, combating and eradicating the corruption scourge but there is an urgent need to plug existing policy gaps that militate against gains that have been made so far, the Speaker of Parliament, Advocate Jacob Mudenda has said.  Formulation of strong whistleblower and witness protection measures, developing a comprehensive list of corruption and corruption-related offenses, and strengthening of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) by extending full prosecutorial and extradition powers need urgent scrutiny. In his keynote address at a capacity workshop for African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) in Bulawayo yesterday, Advocate Mudenda applauded Zacc and other anti-corruption agencies for exposing, combating and eradicating corruption and the abuse of power by those holding political and public office. “However, Zacc has been found wanting in a number of areas which include the ‘catch and release’ as well as for the lack of ‘teeth’ to prosecute high profile figures allegedly caught up in corrupt activities,” said Adv Mudenda. He said some of the high-profile cases involve Government officials. “I must add that the majority of cases handled by Zacc relate to criminal abuse of office by senior officials in Government, State enterprises, parastatals and the private sector,” he added. Adv Mudenda praised Auditor-General, Mrs Mildred Chari saying she “deserves unreserved commendations for the sterling work she is doing without fear or favour.” However, despite the presence of a robust legislative and institutional framework to tackle corruption, Advocate Mudenda said there are a number of policy gaps that need urgent remedy. <img class="size-full wp-image-602610" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-60-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Mildred Chari This, he said could be achieved through the expeditious amendment of Criminal Matters (Mutual Assistance) Act. “This amendment process must be accompanied by the capacitation of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s Financial Intelligence Unit to be able to effectively and efficiently discharge its mandate. “Furthermore, there is need to forge ties with the international community and organisations such as the Asset Recovery Inter-Agency of Southern Africa (Arinsa) and International Police (Interpol) to expedite the asset recovery and extradition processes,” he said. “I am hopeful that the Honourable Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs will move with speed towards tabling the amendment of the said bills before Parliament.” Noting that there has been significant gains made in the fight against corruption, Adv Mudenda decried the “slow pace” of prosecution. <img class="size-full wp-image-475269" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Advocate-Jacob-Mudendabb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Advocate-Jacob-Mudendabb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Advocate-Jacob-Mudendabb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Jacob Mudenda “Let me also hasten to say that one of the major obstructions in the fight against corruption in Zimbabwe is the slow prosecution of cases. In 2020, there were seven criminal convictions out of a total of 90 dockets that were sent to the National Prosecution Authority (NPA). “There were also 300 cases that were submitted by Zacc to the Zimbabwe Republic Police for investigation during that same period,” he said. “It, therefore, follows that there is an urgent need to strengthen the criminal justice system through capacity building initiatives in order to expedite the criminal justice processes.” To that end, the Speaker of Parliament said the Judicial Services Commission must amend court rules to remove unwarranted interlocutory applications which prolong prosecution. Speaking at the same meeting, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister, Cde Judith Ncube said as part of strategies to fight corruption, it is critical to incorporate topics on corruption in the education curricula. “Corruption is real and has now become like a cancer in our communities, cities and at the national level. There is never a day that goes by without reading or hearing a story of a corrupt activity happening in our communities or at the national level,” she said. “This is not acceptable and we should not bury our heads in the sand like an ostrich but work together to address this challenge. I believe one of the strategies is, educating and training our children at a young age to shun corruption. It is also important for our education curricula to include topics on anti-corruption so that we mould future generations that do not support corruption in any way.” APNAC chairperson and Norton MP Temba Mliswa said legislators, Government officials, and ordinary citizens who fail to report corruption at all levels are doing a disservice to President Mnangagwa. “If you are not reporting corruption you are going against what President Mnangagwa said when he declared Zero Tolerance,” said MP Mliswa. — @nqobilebhebhe
