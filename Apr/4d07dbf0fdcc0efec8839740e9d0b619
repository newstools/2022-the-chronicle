The Chronicle Vincent Gono, Features Editor ON Monday, Zimbabwe will be celebrating 42 years of self-rule. For the first time since 1980, the main event will be held in Bulawayo in the spirit of inclusion and devolution. It is a profound statement on the collective ownership of the day according to President Mnangagwa. <img class="wp-image-597730 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ed-123-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa But before people gallivant in merry-making and jubilation it is important to remind each other that the birth of the country Zimbabwe from the belly of colonial Britain did not come easy. It came at the expensive cost of lives, blood, tears and sweat in the protracted struggle to liberate the country from the shackles of colonial subjugation. The colonialists were reluctant to forgo the exploitation of the country’s land, rich mineral resources and enjoyment of free labour, taxation and racial superiority that manifested itself in segregation of the black people. Strategies were therefore employed to perpetuate black oppression and break the spirit of fighting in those that were leading the struggle. Three detention and torture camps were constructed as a quick response to the growing number of African nationalists who felt the need to fight the repressive white regime. Gonakudzingwa in Chiredzi District of Masvingo Province was established by the white regime in April 1964 after WhaWha in Gweru was set up in February of the same year and later Sikombela in Gokwe South District in Midlands Province in June 1965 for purposes of curtailing the nationalist movements that were growing in the early to mid-1960s. There were striking similarities in the geographical location of the three detention camps. Apart from providing punitive accommodation to the black nationalists, the camps were established in the remote, inaccessible parts of the country. Leaders of the revolution mostly from Zapu were detained at the Gonakudzingwa detention camp and they include but are not limited to Cde Joshua Nkomo, Cde Naison Ndlovu, Cde Josiah Chinamano and his wife Ruth Chinamano, Cde Joseph Msika, Cde Jane Lungile Ngwenya, Chief Mangwende, Njini Ntuta and Willie Musarurwa. The detention camp that was situated in Gonarezhou National Park was, as the name depicts, an area where those that were deemed unfit to live in the society where white rule dominated were banished. Those that were kept in the camp were regarded as purveyors of a deadly contagious disease that was unwelcome to the white regime as they threatened its existence and all that it stood for and they were quarantined from others. The detention camp was located within the expansive wildlife zone of Gonarezhou, an area that was and is still famed for being home to big fauna such as elephants, buffalos, lions and rhinos. According to Munyaradzi B Munochiveyi in his book Prisoners of Rhodesia — Inmates and Detainees in the Struggle for Zimbabwe Liberation 1960-1980, by any measure Gonakudzingwa was unattractive for human habitation. <img class="size-full wp-image-329380" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Nkomo-in-1960s1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Nkomo-in-1960s1.jpg 640w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Nkomo-in-1960s1-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> Dr Joshua Nkomo (centre), as leader of the National Democratic Party in the early 1960s, leads a protest march in this file photo. Inset: The late Vice President Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Temperatures were high. The area was exceptionally dry. It had an altitude of 1 000 feet and consequently hotter than the rest of the country. Malaria was endemic in the region. Because of its geographical location that was made worse by its arid conditions, the detainees believed and accepted that it was more of a deliberate ploy by the Rhodesian authorities to make them suffer in the camp than just a matter of mere accident or coincidence. And true, the belief was that after experiencing a torturous life at Gonakudzingwa, the leaders were going to be deterred and go back to influence their black constituencies against rising up against the white minority rule. The late Father Zimbabwe Cde Joshua Nkomo noted in his autobiography with a deep sense of humour how his colleagues and friends Cde Msika and Cde Stanislas Marembo had developed a habit of taking an early morning walk around the detention camp. He wrote, “One morning they met a lion, a big male on the path and they came flying home. “The animals (that lived around Gonakudzingwa) were dangerous but not hostile by intent . . . it was their jungle, not ours. But nobody was going to escape while they were around.” Munochiveyi further noted the experience of detained political activist Victor Kuretu during his first days at the detention camp. He had this to say, “When I first got to Gonakudzingwa, I remember wondering whether we were still in the same country or not. The place was unbearably hot and we used to pass blackish sweat during the first days. The water there was no good. When we boiled the water we would remove some whitish residue which looked like lime mineral. We had problems with wild animals at Gonakudzingwa because it was located in Gonarezhou wildlife reserve. At night and early morning, lions would roar very loudly. We also saw elephants roaming near the camp.” The camp was therefore deliberately set in an animal area to ensure that even with no security whatsoever, no one was going to attempt to escape. And yes, there was no security at the camp for escaping was just like jumping from the frying pan into the fire. The detainees were convinced that the authorities knew that no one would dare attempt to escape because the lions and elephants made sure they would not run away. And with the aggressive animals, they knew that they would not be worried about supervision and security and to synthesise that argument the only supervision was from a little frontier police post on the Rhodesia/Mozambique railway line called Villa Salazar. Detention camps of Gonakudzingwa’s nature were therefore established to halt any liberation movement’s pursuits at freeing the country from the tight grip of the oppressive Smith regime and they were in essence torture and brutality centres. The camp remains one of the most outstanding areas from where the story of political detainees, the execution of the liberation struggle and the country’s independence could be told and the National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe (NMMZ) said it had finished the feasibility studies and its reconstruction as a national museum was already under way after the area was cleared of landmines by the Zimbabwe National Army. NMMZ director Dr Godfrey Mahachi said they were happy that all documentation was now in place and they were only waiting for the camp to be gazetted a national monument. <img class="wp-image-461544 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Dr-Godfrey-Mahachi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Dr-Godfrey-Mahachi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Dr-Godfrey-Mahachi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> NMMZ director Dr Godfrey Mahachi The intention according to him is to create a theme park — a recreation of the camp or some sections of it to give visitors some appreciation of what restriction and detention camps were like. “Our aim is to reconstruct some of the structures and to then interpret the camp life from different perspectives, political, social in relation to the experiences of the camp inmates and the impacts of the entire system not only on the families of the affected inmates but also on the national political development that then ensued, leading to the decisions by the liberation movements to go for the armed struggle. A theme park therefore recreates and also interprets the site to enable visitors to understand the values of the heritage site,” said Dr Mahachi.  Dr Mahachi highlighted that although the makeshift structures that Gonakudzingwa were no longer erect, efforts were in place to make the detention camp a historical monument from where the political history of the country could be told. He said the challenge was that the architecture of Gonakudzingwa was more of a makeshift structure that was erected on a concrete slab. There were metal structures and rondavels which had no permanence. “People need to understand the architecture of Gonakudzingwa. It was not a permanent structure but some kind of makeshift one. We therefore do not have anything monumental, it is the same with Sikombela, there are no structures to talk of but we have done all the work at Sikombela and wish to do so at Gonakudzingwa. With Sikombela we have finished the comprehensive survey and we wish to do that with Gonakudzingwa too but we are waiting for the area to be cleared of landmines,” said Dr Mahachi. He said he was pleased with the work so far saying everything was in order to make the notorious detention camp a national site from where the country’s history could be told.
