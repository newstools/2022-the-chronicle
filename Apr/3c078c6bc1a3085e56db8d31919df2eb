The northern region includes teams from Harare, Manicaland, Mashonaland Central and Mashonaland West. In the men’s category, defending champions Mercenaries, Foxes, JBC, Raiders and UZ Stars will represent the region, with defending champions Hornets, Vixens, Raiders, JBC and UZ Sparks playing in the women’s division. The southern region will be represented by Southern Mavericks, Lakers and Mzansi Lakers in the ladies’ division, while Southern Mavericks is the only confirmed team and qualified by virtue of winning the Bulawayo Basketball Association League. <img class="alignnone wp-image-436024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/basketball-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/basketball-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/basketball-680x380-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The other two teams are yet to be confirmed, as qualifiers held in Gweru were washed out and will only be concluded on Saturday. “This Saturday the last two men’s teams for the National Club Championships will be decided at Khanyisile, which will give us a full complement of teams for the tournament,” Buz president Joe Mujuru said. The BBA last week announced members of the organising committee for the National Club Championships led by Xolani Ndlovu as general manager, Tracy Phiri (competitions manager) and Francis Dube (administrative manager).
BBA president Sinda Mono will oversee the organising committee with the BBA executive committee.  Winners of the national finals will represent the country in the Basketball Africa League (BAL). BAL is Africa’s premier men’s basketball league and consists of 12 teams, which qualify through their domestic competition. The league is a joint effort between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and International Basketball (FIBA), with sponsorship from Nike and Pepsi. – @innocentskizoe
