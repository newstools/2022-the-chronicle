IN the world of business, iconic couple Will and Jada-Pinkett Smith hold a special place as one of the most powerful couples to come together and own a company. The Overbrook Entertainment owners are one of the rare breeds of couples who embrace entrepreneurship.  Perhaps the most famous couples to be in business together are rapper Jay-Z and Beyonce. Together, the pair owns Tidal, a music streaming service and following in their footsteps is a Zimbabwean-born couple, Tafadzwa and Ketiwe Mapiye. The Mapiyes established a family board game they call Zimsecond in 2020. The game seeks to celebrate all things Zimbabwean, from athletes, history, landmarks and culture to television shows. Mrs Mapiye said Covid-19-induced lockdown necessitated the birth of Zimsecond as the pair spent a lot of time together since they had to be at home. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602493" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-41-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-41-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-41-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “In the midst of getting married, getting a house, making it a home, studying, working and other social commitments, Zimsecond seemed like it would never take off until we were locked down due to Covid-19. We had all the time in the world to work on our legacy. In fact, not just ours, but every person featured, every landmark, production, event, you name it. Nothing great about our home was disappearing into history on our watch. We had to cover that,” she said. The South African-based couple originates from Chivi and Zaka, but met  in South Africa before tying the knot three years ago. Mrs Mapiye said meeting her husband was the trigger to the establishment of Zimsecond. “Zimsecond started while we were dating, but we completed it as husband and wife during the lockdown. It’s really an effort from both of us, half him, half me, stories from our childhood, things we love, journeys and experiences we had separately and together. “I’m administrative and he is a moving and breathing Zimbabwean encyclopedia so his vast knowledge in history came in handy as we were conceptualising the game, said Mrs Mapiye. The game is a highway of information exchange enjoyed by families as spouses and children as they share historical gems. Each member picks a card, describes any feature/person/building and then the other members guess the name. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602496" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-38-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-38-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-38-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “You’ll find certain things in there that may not be so great, but very dear to us like the school he went to, Marondera High School, Bikita Minerals, the bus stop to my mum’s village and Humba our maid of honour’s totem. The Salvation Army which is the church where we met and where we congregate and David Whitehead textiles to the snake story that our best man always shared make up the blueprint to refining Zimsecond as we tried to capture every little detail about our childhood and life. “Every word name phrase has a story behind, ours and we know yours too. It’s these stories that make our value proposition, the thought that the joy we had while creating this can be multiplied in different homes, memories shared and created “We know there is nhodo, pada, storo and other indigenous games that are enjoyable, but how can we spend time together as a family? Sharing stories, learning, teaching, laughing, interacting and having fun. Zimsecond is just the solution,” said Mrs Mapiye. She said Zimsecond was also about enriching our artistic and cultural heritage with topics ranging from history, sport and music taking centre stage. “Our game is also about culture where we celebrate music, dance, sport and film. To us, it’s not just Sungura or Zimdancehall, it’s the music that makes our people dance and our weddings memorable. It’s not just The Warriors or Sables or Chevrons or GEMs, it’s the dreams of our brothers and sisters to represent us nationally. “It’s not just Gringo or Kapfupi, but the great talent that had households gather together and enjoy tales and jokes. We celebrate the great Mai Chisamba Show that challenged social norms and discussed them with our people. There is so much to be proud of. “This doesn’t remove the challenges, but highlights them in some cases, but we hope it will bring us together and maybe, even urge us to go see the great sites such as Great Zimbabwe or Victoria Falls.” <img class="wp-image-602646 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Great-Zimbabwe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Great-Zimbabwe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Great-Zimbabwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Great Zimbabwe Mrs Mapiye said they originally wanted to call the game Zimsec, but ended up settling on Zimsecond. Narrating how the game is played she said: “It’s a game played on time. There are four different stages, from 40 seconds to 10 seconds per game. A player picks a card and cleverly describes the items on the card to their team members without giving too much away. “The other members have to guess what is on the pick using the slight clues you would have given them. The idea lies on you not giving away too much when giving them clues,” said Mrs Mapiye. She also highlighted how easy it is to concentrate on negativities, but said Zimsecond is about patriotism and celebrates positives in Zimbabwe. “It’s very easy to fixate on the negativity around our country and miss out on celebrating great talent, production, events and landmarks around us! Despite the challenges, history is still being made and our aim is to ensure that no name goes unnoticed, no one great disappears into history. “You will know some of the items on the cards, some you will not and that is a learning moment and we hope it will be a pride moment as well when you find out! So much has led people to find alternative homes and they have been comfortably welcomed, but Zimbabwe remains our place of birth and maybe not for others and we hope to appeal to those as well and heal that nostalgia. And if it doesn’t exist, may it be an opportunity to learn and take pride. That’s what we are about,” added Mrs Mapiye. – @eMKlass_49
