Janet Manyowa who is behind hits Zadzisa, Many Blessings, Makafanira and Ndimi among many others said the show was long overdue as her fans have been asking to see her performing live in the City of Kings and Queens. “It’s been a long time coming. Many of our followers have been requesting us to come to Bulawayo over the years. We could have done it earlier, but Covid-19 happened. “We also did a poll at the beginning of the year and Bulawayo was the most requested. We’re excited that it’s finally happening and we’ll be meeting our followers outside Harare,” said Manyowa. She said she will bring her A-game and called upon gospel music lovers and her fans to come through as the show will be uplifting. “My fans can expect a very good show and worship experience. We’re going to have a star-studded lineup and great collaboration with the locals and a recording set. “We’ll be revealing an artiste each week for the next five weeks after having announced Vocal Ex last week.” <img class="size-full wp-image-596573" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-6-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-6-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-6-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vocal Ex With three albums to her name, King of Glory, Grateful and Sounds of Victory, those who will attend the show will be spoilt for choice as almost all of Manyowa’s songs are hits.
