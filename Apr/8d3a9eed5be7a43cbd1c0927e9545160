The accident also resulted in the death of Mr Ntandoyenkosi Sibanda (32), Ms Silandulo Hogo (57), Mr Khulekani Hlongwani (29), Mr Maxwell Gusabva (34) all from Pumula South suburb and Mr Limukani Mlala from Emthunzini suburb. Police have said the seventh person is a male adult who is yet to be identified and could be aged between 35 and 40 years old. A Chronicle news crew yesterday spoke to families of three of the accident victims; Mr Sibanda, Ms Hogo and Mr Mangena. Mr Sibanda will be buried at Luveve Cemetery while Ms Hogo and Mr Mangena will be buried at Umvutsha Park Cemetery. The news crew spoke to Mr Sibanda’s family who revealed that they sensed danger after receiving WhatsApp messages communicating that there had been a serious accident near Nkulumane Shopping Complex robots. Mr Sibanda’s cousin Ms Sifikile Ndebele, said after learning about the accident from messages that were circulating on WhatsApp, she quickly called Mr Sibanda’s number and sadly it was answered by a police officer from Traffic West Police Station who invited them to come to the police station. <img class="size-full wp-image-604699" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Sinikiwe Luphahla and Mr Mlandeli Ndebele (relatives to driver Epworth Mangena) “That’s where they broke the news that he was one of the six people who died on the spot. It’s difficult for us because he has been fending for his family as a vendor. “He worked hard and leaves behind a nine-year-old daughter. His death has robbed us of a brother and a father figure as well,” said Ms Ndebele. She said the family remembers Mr Sibanda as a man who worked hard to provide for his family. Mr Sibanda’s sister Ms Sikhathele Sibanda, said her brother had separated with the mother of his child. “We have lost a brother and more significantly his child has been left fatherless,” said Ms Sibanda.  <img class="size-full wp-image-603732" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Mangena family said the deceased is survived by wife and two minor children and was looking after his ailing mother. Mr Mangena’s aunt Ms Sinikiwe Luphahla said they were informed by neighbours that Mr Mangena had died following a collision on his way to town. “They were told that he had died in a serious accident where several other people also died. He was a family man looking not just after his family but his mother. We are really worried because we do not know who will take care of his family and his ill mother,” said Ms Luphahla. She said Mr Mangena also doubled as a pastor at a local pentecostal church. Ms Hogo’s brother Mr Cephas Moyo said his sister was a widow who died on her way to the bank. “She was not working but on that particular day she was supposed to withdraw her late husband’s pension allowances. She leaves behind four children and three of them are now adults taking care of themselves,” said Mr Moyo. Another family member Mr Nathaniel Mabhikwa expressed concern over recklessness on the roads. He said more needs to be done to stop the road carnage. “People will continue to board pirate kombis because Zupco buses and kombis are not adequate. “We need more Zupco buses to reduce accidents. On a daily basis we observe the recklessness of kombi drivers,” said Mr Mabhikwa. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said failure to observe rules of the road was a major concern.  “Every day we receive reports of people injured or killed in road accidents. Some of the motorists do not stop when they knock down pedestrians yet the road Traffic Act is very clear that when one gets involved in an accident, they have to stop and render assistance. We need a total change of mindset if we are to make our roads safe for everyone,” said Asst Comm Nyathi.
