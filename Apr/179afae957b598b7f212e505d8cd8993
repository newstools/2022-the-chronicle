Master KG and Zanda Zakuza were major crowd-pullers with people singing along to all of the songs that they churned out. After their performance, Agartha Murudzwa took over and blessed the crowd with her gospel tunes. From there, it was time to take things a notch up with Banolila hit-maker Chase Skuza taking over. It was a nostalgic moment for those who have been following the gala over the years. When he performed Banolila, the crowd went into a frenzy. Thereafter, it was time for Dendera with Sulumani Chimbetu. He started off by performing his late father – Simon’s song Dzandipedza Mafuta before playing his popular Sean Timba and Nyuchi songs. He got people to dance and sing along with him. From the Kanjiva dances, the axe-wielding Madlela Skhobokhobo, another crowd favourite took to the stage. With the rhumba beat at its peak, people had no option but to join the artiste in dance and imitate some of the dancers’ high-energy dance moves. 50 Du was a hit among revellers. More highlights of the night were Masotha and Sungura Masters as well as Roki. Despite the chilly weather, people braved it and kept themselves warm by dancing the night away. – @mthabisi_mthire
