Zimbabwe football giants, Highlanders FC and Dynamos will compete for the Independence trophy with President Mnangagwa watching, before his Excellency presents the trophy to the winners and the medals to the runners’ up, alongside Vice President Constantino Chiwenga. For the first time since 1980, the main celebrations will be held outside Harare under the theme: “Zimbabwe at 42: Leaving no one behind.” Independence Day is on April 18, and this year the country celebrates 42 years of freedom and majority rule. The theme dovetails with the Second Republic’s drive towards promotion of national unity, devolution and decentralisation. Minister Moyo said the President invited all political parties to be part of the celebrations and the State Reception because it was brought about by all Zimbabweans and some who have departed. “This Independence was brought about by all Zimbabweans from all walks of life with some already departed and some still alive in their different capacities. The Independence celebrations which are being organized outside Harare for the first time, is also a recognition of our constitutional agenda of devolution,” said Minister Moyo. “The leaders have been invited to come to the celebrations. The President’s emphasis has been; all the political leaders of this country should be invited and both for the State Reception that will take place on April 17, at State House in Bulawayo and Independence Day celebrations. Invitations have been sent to their offices and we started sending these yesterday (Thursday), we have ensured that our officials have contacted all the political leaders to tell them that their cards can either be picked here in Bulawayo or at their offices. <img class="size-full wp-image-446111" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/page-1-Inspection.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/page-1-Inspection.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/page-1-Inspection-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> File Pic: President Emmerson Mnangagwa inspects a Guard of Honour during the 39th Independence Day celebrations in Harare “The President has also invited all political leaders in this country to the VIP stands that have been prepared for these celebrations.
