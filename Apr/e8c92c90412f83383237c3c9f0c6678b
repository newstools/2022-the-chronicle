THE Zimbabwe ladies cricket team bounced back from an opening defeat to Namibia in the Capricorn Women’s Tri-Series to beat Uganda by eight runs in their second game of the tournament in Windhoek yesterday.  Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat, and were bundled out for 100 as the batters struggled to put runs on the board on a surface that seemed more suited for the bowlers. In their chase, Uganda fell short by eight runs in their allocated 20 overs. Scoring 92 for eight. Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano, who scored 80 against Namibia, was again Zimbabwe’s top scorer with 46. <img class="size-full wp-image-602205" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano Aneshu Mushangwe picked up two wickets for the Lady Chevrons with Francis Chipare and Michelle Mavunga also chipping in with a wicket each. Pace bowler Chipare was making her debut and was the only change to the team that lost to Namibia, replacing Nomvelo Sibanda. Lady Chevrons captain Mary-Anne Musonda said: “I thought we lost wickets in groups and obviously that creates a lot of pressure. What we need now is to create bigger partnerships and make sure one of our top four bats through the innings. I think we improved with the ball more than we did yesterday.” <img class="size-full wp-image-602208" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-54-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-54-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-54-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lady Chevrons captain Mary-Anne Musonda Player of the Match Mugeri-Tiripano said: “It feels good to be scoring in different conditions. These are different conditions from the conditions at home where we are used to playing. I had to be patient while batting.” The two teams will play each other again this afternoon. – @innocentskizoe
