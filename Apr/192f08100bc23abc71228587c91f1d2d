HIP-HOP muso Msiz’kay is set to release his third studio album on June 24.  The album will be a follow-up to his last album, Bayashiselwa which was released three years ago. Msiz’kay said he is keeping the name of the album a secret but urged fans to expect good music. “The album has been in the works for the past three years. It’ll have many surprise features on production, vocalists and rappers,” said Msiz’kay. The 2021 Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards Outstanding Male Musician said the production will show how he has grown musically over the years. “The album will take the listener deeper into the heart, soul and mind of Msiz’kay. It’ll have no less than 16 tracks and the main sound will be my Something Afro genre — a fusion of hip-hop, Pop and RnB mixed with traditional African music,” said Msiz’kay. He said there will be a live launch of the album. The artiste who is undeniably one of the country’s finest artistes, is behind the hit Ngawuzw’Umoya Wami. He said he believes that his distinct sound and song writing skills set him apart from other musicians. “I’m a pioneer of my own style of music that I call Something Afro, which fuses hip-hop and RnB with various traditional African music to come up with a unique sound.” said Msiz’kay.
