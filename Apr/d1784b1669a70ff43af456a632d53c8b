The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter ARTS practitioners who hail from Plumtree town were honoured for uplifting the border town at the inaugural Plumtree Arts and Culture Awards (Paca) that coincided with the Thabo Arts Academy Awards (TAAA) at Randfontein in Gauteng province. The event that was held this past weekend was held under the theme, “Appreciating each other in arts”. Paca honoured artistes, both living and those who have passed away. The awards founder, renowned arts practitioner Thabo Nkomo said the idea came after the realisation that since 1990, there has not been an awards ceremony to honour those from Plumtree who have been contributing immensely to the arts and culture industry. “The main aim of Paca was to appreciate Plumtree arts practitioners of yesteryear and now,” Nkomo said. He said the idea of the awards came after the realisation that since 1990, there had never been any Plumtree awards. Below is a list of Paca winners OUTSTANDING POET/ESS: 1. Prosperity M. Mpofu 2.
