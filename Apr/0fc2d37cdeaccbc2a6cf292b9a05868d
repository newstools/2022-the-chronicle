The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has fired Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) commissioner, Mr Frank Muchengwa for gross misconduct. His dismissal follows findings by a tribunal set to inquire into his removal from office as a ZACC commissioner. The commission completed its mandate last week and presented its recommendations in writing to President Mnangagwa, in terms of the Constitution. The tribunal was chaired by retired Justice Nicholas Ndou and included Permanent Secretary for Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Mrs Virginia Mabiza, Dr Tarisai Mutangi and Ms Tecla Mapota, and formally presented its findings to the President today.
