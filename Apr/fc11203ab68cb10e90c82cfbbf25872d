The Chronicle Ephesians 4 vs 2 “Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.” I have never understood how people end up becoming nasty and out-rightly malicious. Somehow social media has become the preferred platform for spreading abuse, hatred and even false statements. <img class="alignnone wp-image-458234 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/laptop-and-social-media-icons.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/laptop-and-social-media-icons.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/laptop-and-social-media-icons-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> People now have a tendency to hide behind a screen and attack, bully and damage another person’s image and reputation using this new found medium that can spread information at the speed of lightning. Things get out of control really fast and before you know it untold damage would have occurred. We have become very intolerant of anything that goes against us but I believe it is possible for people to disagree in an agreeable manner. Why not look for what unites us rather than what divides us? Always remember your perspective is not the only one and you have to respect other people’s opinions if you want yours to be heard.  Let us all ask the Lord to grant us self-restraint, tolerance and more importantly patience in the face of adversity. May we display wisdom in our response to the things that anger us. May our Lord and Saviour mould our character to reflect His image and in all our actions, may we seek to be guided by love and for our footsteps to be directed by the Lord. Be blessed
