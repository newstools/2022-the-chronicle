THE Ingwebu ZITF Tug of War National Championships are set for a return at this year’s trade showcase, with sponsors Ingwebu Breweries affirming their commitment to the competition. This comes as a relief to players and the game’s fans, who last saw action in 2019.
Ingwebu sales distribution and marketing manager Ray Makwaiba said they were excited to have the competition back after a two-year hiatus. <img class="size-full wp-image-603019" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-52-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-52-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-52-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ray Makwaiba “As Ingwebu we are excited to come back to sponsor this competition. We know the situation that has happened with the Covid-19 situation, but things are going back to normal and we thought we should have the competition back. We are happy to come back and sponsor this competition. “We need people to go out there and enjoy themselves. This is a sport that is big, but not magnified. This is an opportunity to magnify this sport in the country and make it one of the big sporting events,” said Makwaiba.
ZITF deputy chief executive officer Stella Nkomo also expressed delight at the return of the competition. <img class="wp-image-603022 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-53-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ingwebu Breweries “Trade Fair was not the same without the sport and we would like to thank the sponsor. We wouldn’t be here without them. It’s up to us to be the ambassadors of the sport to inspire others to join the sport and make it big,” said Nkomo. She described the competition as one of ZITF’s signature event.  The draw for the tug of war finals was conducted on Friday. Women
