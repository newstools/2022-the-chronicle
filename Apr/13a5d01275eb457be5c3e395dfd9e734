The Chronicle Psalms 133:1 — 3 When Brothers Dwell in Unity. A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes! It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-600516" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-19-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-19-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-19-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore. i) When People Are of One Language They Can Achieve Anything They Imagine to Do. Anything imagined becomes very possible. Imagination has no boundaries or limits; you can imagine as far as you want. ii) Nothing Can Be Restrained from United People. Why do you have so many unfinished projects nowadays? Why is it difficult to finish what you start? The reason is because there is lack of unity. How many unfinished buildings do we come across? Many Companies and churches have acquired stands but very few build to completion. Most stop building at window levels and even five years can pass by with no progress. Why would a company stop building at window level or roof level? The reason is lack of unity!  Once one person begins to speak a language of “we can’t,” things will not move. If all of us say “yes, we can” things will move. Matthew 18: 19 KJV “Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven” How many times have we prayed for things and they have not come to pass? As a church, how many things have we asked from God and they have not been fulfilled? I was praying and I said to God we have prayed for so many things, even in the nation why are we not receiving anything? The answer is simply because there is no unity! If people agree on anything on earth God can grant it as long as there is unity. When people are of one language they are focused. Focused people have a target and a vision – they do things in a specific way. Where there is unity you will always see a difference. The Lord always pours His blessings there.
