KEY Highlanders midfielders, Nqobizitha Masuku, Adrian Silla and Rahman Kutsanzira, will have to pass a late fitness test to make the trip to Zvishavane for tomorrow’s Castle Lager Premier Soccer League clash against FC Platinum.  The trio has been central in Highlanders’ seven-game unbeaten streak, including their 1-0 Independence Cup victory over Dynamos in Bulawayo. Highlanders took a risk by fielding Masuku, who was not fully fit for the epic Dynamos clash. Masuku has been carrying an ankle injury he picked up on Matchday 10 when Highlanders drew 0-0 away to Triangle United. He missed Bosso’s 2-2 draw with Cranborne Bullets at Barbourfields Stadium before the Uhuru Cup final. Silla was pulled out during the Dynamos match with a shin injury. Joel Ngodzo replaced Silla, playing the last 10 minutes of the encounter. <img class="size-full wp-image-602194" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-52-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-52-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-52-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Adrian Silla Kutsanzira picked up an ankle injury just before half-time in the Independence Cup and was replaced by forward Washington Navaya. Kutsanzira described his chances of making the Zvishavane trip as 50-50. “I really would love to be part of the team and be certified fit for the FC Platinum game. Right now, I’m still feeling some pain when running and I think my chances of making the trip stand at 50-50,” said Kutsanzira.
Bosso coach Mandla Mpofu said the availability of the trio will be determined after today’s training. <img class="size-full wp-image-598023" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Mandla-Mpofu-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla Mpofu Already ruled out is Ray Lunga, who will only start training after two weeks. “If they’re (Silla, Masuku and Kutsanzira) to make it, I doubt that they will last the entire game. They are all subject to passing late fitness tests. I must say we took a big risk when we fielded Masuku against Dynamos because he played through pain. He’s a player with a big character and I don’t know if we’ll risk him this weekend or not,” Mpofu said. He challenged his charges to have the same attitude they displayed against Dynamos where they showed zeal to play and win. “FC Platinum are a big side because they’ve won almost everything on the local scene and for that they deserve a big club tag. We know they like passing the ball around like we do and we have to plan adequately for the game. Our play has improved a lot and I want my players to take the same winning attitude that they showed in our last game against Dynamos. I think if we stick to our game plan, be disciplined in managing the game, then we can come out with a positive result. We want to win this game and it’s possible to win it,” said Mpofu. Striker Stanley Ngala, scorer of the solitary goal in the Independence Cup, is looking forward to facing his former paymasters. <img class="size-full wp-image-601621" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/stanlny-ngala.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/stanlny-ngala.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/stanlny-ngala-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stanley Ngala “I’ll be happy if we collect maximum points in Zvishavane. It’s not that I’ll be going there on a revenge mission because they shipped me out, but I want us to win as a team. My job as a striker is to score, but if I fail to score, I have to create scoring opportunities and help the team. That’s (winning) what I want on Saturday, to bring home maximum points,” Ngala said. FC Platinum have youngsters who have been doing well in the form of striker Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya (19), Hagaziyo Magaya (21), Kelvin Mangiza (20), Panashe Mtimbanyoka (19) and Oscar Bhebhe (19).
