The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS defensive midfielder and their leading scorer with five goals, Nqobizitha Masuku has been ruled out of his team’s next league match against Cranborne Bullets due to an ankle injury. Masuku picked up an ankle injury in Sunday’s stalemate draw at Triangle United when he tried to intercept a pass. Highlanders’ coach Mandla Mpofu said Masuku could return to training next week when Bosso prepares for the Independence celebratory match against Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium. “The medical team had a look at Nqo in the morning and the good thing is that he doesn’t have a fracture, it’s a swollen ankle. The team doctor recommended that he rests, keep his leg elevated and occasionally put ice on it. This means that he’s definitely out of this coming weekend game against Cranborne Bullets and will start training after assessment set for Monday next week,” Mpofu said. Highlanders, who are on a five-match unbeaten run, will miss Masuku, who was on target in both their home wins. He also scored in the 1-1 draw against Caps United. In the absence of Masuku, Darlington Munkuli, who was promoted to the first team last week from Bosso 90 to take up Winston Mhango’s place, might find himself thrown into the fray against Cranborne Bullets. “We have cover in that defensive midfield position and Darlington should be able to step up,” said Mpofu. – @ZililoR
