ZANU-PF will be guided by its ideology to detect infiltration in the party, Bulawayo Provincial Chairman Cde Jabulani Sibanda has said.  Addressing party members in Magwegwe suburb in Bulawayo last Saturday, Cde Sibanda, said Zanu-PF brought freedom to the people of Zimbabwe. “I am here to remove termites in the party. Party ideology must not be replaced by ‘madzvatsvatsva’, people who know nothing. We want people who work for the party not people who are manipulating the party. Let us get out of our houses and fix our party. We want to fix the party back to its ideology. Iam giving it seven weeks or so and some people holding higher positions in the party will not be there,,” he said. Cde Sibanda urged the young people to work for the party saying they were the country’s future leaders. He said the party members should know their duties and desist from corruption which tarnishes the image of the party. “It is now time to fix party structures in preparation for the general elections. Party structures have been prepared for the internal elections but not the general elections. I will also call another meeting so that I can teach people to know their duties. I will start in this area to fix the party back to its ideology,” said Cde Sibanda. He said party members should desist from working with the opposition parties as they continue giving them false promises which gives them false hope. “Laws are supposed to empower us but Bulawayo City Council has made laws that oppress us. Zanu- PF is for freedom but freedom does not just come easy, this is a revolution and you do not fight for freedom in one day. We got freedom to vote because we fought, we also went on to fight for the land and we will continue fighting to get everything step by step. I also encourage district party members to work hard to make sure that there are strong party branches,” he said. – @BlezarKarubwa.
