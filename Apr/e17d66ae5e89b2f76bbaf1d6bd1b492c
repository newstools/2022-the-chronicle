DESPITE Chicken Inn’s 0-3 drubbing by bottom club Whawha at Ascot Stadium in Gweru on Saturday, head coach Joey Antipas and striker Brian Muza had something to cheer about when they were named Coach and Player of the Month for February yesterday. The defeat by Whawha threw the championship race wide open and Antipas fuming at his charges for undermining their opponents. However, it was double delight for Antipas, who also bagged the March accolade, with the best player for march being William Manondo of Caps United. Muza, who has been enjoying a good run and is instrumental in Chicken Inn’s fine run, has scored seven goals.
The pint-sized striker was shocked to win the February accolade. <img class="size-full wp-image-597003" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-24-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Brian Muza “I surprised that I’ve been voted Player of the Month for February, but at the same time I’m happy that my hard work is being recognised. I couldn’t have done it without the help of my teammates, coaches, management and supporters. My wish is to win more awards, but I’ll be happy if we win the championship,” said Muza. The 25-year-old forward expressed his disappointment at losing to Whawha, a result that saw them surrendering top spot to Dynamos, who held Ngezi Platinum Stars to a 0-0 draw at Baobab Stadium. Dynamos are now tied on 23 points with Chicken Inn, but the resurgent Harare giants have a superior goal difference after taking their unbeaten run to six games. Muza wants his teammates to recover from the Whawha loss, which ended their eight-match unbeaten run. “It’s unfortunate that we lost to Whawha and that was an indication that the competition is tough. It’s (defeat to Whawha) a reminder that there are no light opponents. Everyone in the squad is naturally down following that defeat, but we need to pick ourselves up and get our act right,” said Muza. Whawha’s victory lifted them into 17th place, exchanging places with Bulawayo City, who were felled 0-2 at home by champions FC Platinum. City now anchor the table with six points from 11 games and trail Whawha by two points.  Chicken Inn’s defeat and Dynamos’ draw was a blessing for FC Platinum, who moved a place up the table into fifth position and closing the gap with the log leaders to four points.  Going into the weekend, FC Platinum were trailing the Gamecocks by seven points. Triangle United also slid into fourth position following their 1-0 defeat by Herentals and were leapfrogged by Manica Diamonds, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Bulawayo Chiefs. Chiefs were unlucky to return from Mutare with just a point, as they fluffed a number of chances, with Perfect Chikwende and Billy Veremu the guilty parties.
For Chiefs, who are win-less in eight matches, the draw against Manica Diamonds was a good result considering that the Gem Boys have been ruthless at home. Teams that left Mutare empty handed against Manica Diamonds are Whawha, who were beaten 4-0, Highlanders, who lost 1-0, Caps United, who were thrashed 6-2, and Triangle United, who fell 2-1. FC Platinum managed to sneak out with a point following a 0-0 draw.
