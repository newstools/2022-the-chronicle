The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief REDCLIFF Municipality Heads of Departments (HODs) and management recently signed performance contracts to enhance accountability and good governance in the local authority. Government was the first to introduce the concept of top officials signing performance contracts, with permanent secretaries and ministers among those who have done that so far. The results will be made public in line with the Second Republic’s thrust to promote a culture of accountability and improve service delivery. Redcliff mayor Councillor Clayton Masiyatsva, his councillors and town clerk Mr Gilson Chakauya presided over the signing ceremony of the performance contracts for 2022. <img class="size-full wp-image-457155" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Redcliff-Town-Clerk-Gilson-Chakauya.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Redcliff-Town-Clerk-Gilson-Chakauya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Redcliff-Town-Clerk-Gilson-Chakauya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gilson Chakauya Cllr Masiyatsva hailed Government’s initiative which he said will go a long way in ensuring that the local authority and the country at large achieve the vision of becoming an upper-middle income economy by 2030 as is envisaged in the National Development Strategy (NDS) 1. “As Redcliff Municipality we are following the lead of the Government which introduced the annual performance contracts. This will go a long way in ensuring that the local authority and the country at large achieve its vision of becoming an upper-middle class economy by 2030 as is envisaged in the National Development Strategy (NDS) 1,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-518664 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/National-dev-strategy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/National-dev-strategy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/National-dev-strategy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Chakauya said the decision to hold public officials accountable was not only noble but was also consistent with the country’s constitution. He said public officials should put the interests of the people first and called for team work council to achieve set targets. <img class="wp-image-602928 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/President-Mnangagwa-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/President-Mnangagwa-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/President-Mnangagwa-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa “His Excellency (President Mnangagwa) emphasised that we as public officials should always put the interest of the people first and he also stressed the need for teamwork so as to achieve the set goals,” said Mr Chakauya. He said non-performers will lose their contracts. “Non-performers will definitely go under normal circumstances,” said Mr Chakauya. Cabinet Ministers and heads of public institutions in February signed performance contracts as the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa fosters a high-performance culture among office bearers to enhance accountability and good governance. The development follows the New Dispensation’s commitment to making  public results of the performance of Government officials as a way of ensuring transparency.  President Mnangagwa presided over the signing ceremony of Cabinet Ministers, heads of parastatals and State entities and local authorities. Permanent Secretaries for 21 Ministries were the first to sign the performance contracts last year.
