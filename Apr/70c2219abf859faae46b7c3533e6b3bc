The Chronicle Yesterday we ran a back page story on Nqobizitha Masuku dumping Highlanders to join across town rivals Bulawayo Chiefs in a deal facilitated by a Portugal-based player agent Você Está Sendo Enganado. For starters, Masuku is going nowhere, that was simply an April Fools day. The name attributed to the agent is actually Portuguese language meaning “you are being deceived.”  We even quoted Bosso chief executive officer Ronald Moyo somehow confirming the development where he wished for a Damascus moment like one Enganado Novamente. Well Enganado novamente is also Portuguese meaning “you are being deceived again.” – Sports Reporter.
