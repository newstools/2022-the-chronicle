The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter Businesses have been challenged to embrace digital marketing platforms to grow their brands. Speaking at Icebo Designing Expo held yesterday in Bulawayo, graphic designer Mpi Ndebele said professionally crafted designs have the power to grow businesses. During the expo, website designers, photographers and videographers and printers expressed their understanding of how designing can help to improve brand image and also understanding of the business by clients. “A design speaks louder, clearer and better than words, graphic design tells a story of your brand or company’s history or philosophy,” said Mr Ndebele. <img class="alignnone wp-image-600379 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-21-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-21-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-21-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Citing global tech giants, Apple he said the firm’s logo is not accompanied by any mission statement but the brand is doing well.

Mr Ndebele also said graphic design creates new prospects for customers to the brand and making use of high-quality designs can positively attract new clients to the brand.
