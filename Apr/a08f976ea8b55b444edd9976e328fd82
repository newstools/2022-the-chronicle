ZIMBABWE Rugby Union (ZRU) vice-president Martin Shone says they are not going to the Rugby Africa Under-20 Barthes Trophy tournament to add numbers, but compete with some of the best teams on the continent.  Shone travelled with the team that left for Nairobi yesterday morning. “We have prepared well and the guys are looking sharp. I believe we are in with a huge chance of qualifying. Winners of the tournament will be crowned African champions and will represent the continent in next year’s edition of the World Rugby Junior Trophy,” said Shone. Zimbabwe is among eight teams competing for the Rugby Africa Under-20 Barthes Trophy. Other countries are Madagascar, Tunisia, Namibia, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Zambia and hosts Kenya. Zimbabwe kick off their campaign with a tricky quarter-final encounter against North African side Tunisa tomorrow. Former champions Namibia will get the tournament underway against Cote d’Ivoire. Madagascar, losing finalists in 2021, will play Zambia in the day’s third fixture before hosts and defending champions Kenya take on neighbours Uganda in the last quarter-final fixture. Zimbabwe referee Talent Gore is among officials at the tournament.
