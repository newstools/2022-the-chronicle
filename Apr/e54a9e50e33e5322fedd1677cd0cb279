THE time has come for Matabeleland region and Limpopo Province of South Africa to operationalise the existing memoranda of understanding (MoU) to unlock mutual economic interests and develop their economies. <img class="alignnone wp-image-604069 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-55-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-55-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-55-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Trans-Limpopo Spatial Development Initiative (TLSDI) head of delegation, Mr Matodzi Ruthumbu, said this in Bulawayo on Tuesday during a reception for delegates to the on-going 62nd edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) that was hosted by the Bulawayo City Council. The TLSDI was first proposed in 1998 with an MoU subsequently signed in March 2001 between South Africa’s Limpopo province and Matabeleland region. The initiative aims to create an economic corridor from Limpopo Province in South Africa through to Victoria Falls to promote trade and economic development in the Trans-Limpopo corridor as well as facilitating the flow of traffic and other movement between the two countries. Mr Ruthumbu said Bulawayo and Polokwane, for instance, signed MoUs way back in 2016 and what is needed now is to utilise the opportunity and realise each other’s capacity for economic growth. “Limpopo Province and Matabeleland signed MoUs some time back, but we have not utilised the opportunity for a long time now,” he said. “The two regions have different capacities and we can use that through the MoUs we have and develop our regions,” said Mr Ruthumbu. He said operationalising the MoUs will help the two regions to share ideas on how to improve the two cities, which are Bulawayo and Polokwane and their regions at large. Mr Ruthumbu said Zimbabwe has a lot of base metals which can be of advantage to the regions’ growth. Earlier, during his welcome remarks Bulawayo Mayor, Councillor Solomon Mguni, said delegates should utilise the ZITF window to sample the city’s investment opportunities and tap into big trade deals. <img class="wp-image-604077 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-56-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-56-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-56-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Mayor, Councillor Solomon Mguni He said the City of Bulawayo remains committed to ensuring that the city attracts investments. “The timely visit is most welcome as it further coincides with the current national trade showcase the ZITF, which Bulawayo is hosting,” said Clr Mguni. “The thrust of the Spatial Development Initiative is to create economic development of the region through value addition, increasing exports and generation of sustainable employment.” Under the framework, Matabeleland and Limpopo Province are keen to take advantage of their strategic locations and strong social ties and using their collective resources to integrate their economies. National trade development and promotion agency, Zimtrade, has also backed the trade initiative between Zimbabwe and Limpopo saying the two countries have an advantage in terms of the proximity.  In a survey done last year, Zimtrade found out that there is a great market opportunity for Zimbabwean products and the organisation urged Zimbabwean producers to utilise the advantages, which include trade agreements and proximity between two countries.
