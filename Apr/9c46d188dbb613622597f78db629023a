THE Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) will hold its final qualifying event for the Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile at White City Stadium today. <img class="size-full wp-image-604248" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> White City Stadium Watson Madenyika, the Bab chairperson, said they are calling on all athletes who feel they may have a chance in the race to answer to the final call. “We will have our final qualifiers today. We are calling on all athletes to come and have a go at the qualifiers. There are athletes from as far as Harare who have confirmed that they will be coming for the final qualifier and we hope to also have a good number of local athletes coming to try their luck. “We have had athletes recording poor times, which is of great concern, but we hope those that have failed in previous qualifiers will attend the final qualifiers and try to improve their times,” said Madenyika.  Bab may be forced to forgo the semi-finals as a limited number of athletes have managed to qualify. Traditionally, the semi-finals are used to screen the final 20 men that will participate in the final, but as it stands, only 12 athletes have qualified for the semi-finals, meaning these could be heading straight into the final at the ZITF main arena on Saturday. The ZITF Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile has a pre-requisite time of four minutes 31 seconds for one to qualify for the final at the ZITF main arena. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-568413" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-20-at-16.01.20-e1632148049358.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="453" /> A cash prize of $112 000 awaits the winner of the race while $56 000 is in store for the first runner-up and $49 000 for the second runner-up. – @innocentskizoe
