GARY Brent’s first assignment as Lady Chevrons’ head coach ended in a losing cause when they slumped to a seven-wicket defeat to Namibia in the opening match of the Capricorn Women’s triangular series in Windhoek yesterday . The Lady Chevrons won the toss and elected to bat, posting a total of 130-3 in 20 overs. Namibia managed to chase down the total in 19 overs to win with two balls to spare.  Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano top-scored for the Lady Chevrons with 80 runs off 60 deliveries, while the usually dependable Mary-Anne Musonda was dismissed for 14. Debutant Michelle Mavunga retained figures of two for 10 with the ball from her allotted four overs.
Lady Chevrons captain Musonda felt it was a game her side did not apply themselves with both bat and ball. “I thought Tiripano batted very well. She really composed herself even though Namibia were also bowling well. I thought it was a good wicket. Anyone who managed to apply themselves with the bat and ball had something. We saw Namibia bowling well and bat well as well. So, I thought it was a fair wicket, but we just did not apply ourselves with bat and ball,” said Musonda. <img class="wp-image-575078 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Lady-Chevrons-Zim.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Lady-Chevrons-Zim.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Lady-Chevrons-Zim-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lady Chevrons Zimbabwe were meant to face Uganda in the opening fixture yesterday morning before facing the hosts in the afternoon, but there was a fixture amendment, which saw them only facing Namibia.

The tri-series games will be played up to April 27. The tournament will consist of a triple round-robin stage followed by a final between the top two teams. Zimbabwe squad
