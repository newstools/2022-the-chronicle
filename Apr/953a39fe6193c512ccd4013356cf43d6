HIGHLANDERS are expected to start explorations at the Inyathi gold mine after getting a licence and securing a partner for the mining venture.  Bosso collected their mining licence in Harare last Friday, the day that they unveiled their new Sakunda branded kit. Highlanders had been seeking a partner to jointly mine at their claim awarded to them by President Mnangagwa in 2020. The Inyathi venture is expected to improve the club’s cash flow and turn the Bulawayo giants into a profit-making entity. Bosso join Talen Vision and Bulawayo Chiefs, who are already into gold mining as the two teams are owned by successful gold miners Khumbulani Nkomo and Lovemore Sibanda respectively. “We received the document (mining licence) last week. The direction from here will be communicated in due course,” said Ronald Moyo, Highlanders’ chief executive officer. He could not be drawn into divulging the partner or when actual operations will start. “All along the club has been working on the paperwork and we got the licence to start mining last Friday. Through the mine, the club will have a new revenue stream. “All the documentation needed has been secured; there’s a partner who has also been found but will be announced at an appropriate time. What is key is that key steps have been taken to make sure that the club gets on with the mining project.” – @ZililoR
