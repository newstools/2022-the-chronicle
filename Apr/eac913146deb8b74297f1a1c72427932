The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
THE national mobile registration exercise is reportedly getting huge response in Matabeleland North with youth constituting most of the applicants.  The Civil Registry Department is conducting a countrywide mobile registration which started on April 1 and ends on September 30. During the exercise, the department is issuing birth certificates, death certificates and national identity documents. The exercise which is reported to be going on well in all the seven districts, is meant to afford citizens an opportunity to obtain national identity documents at places close to them. The centres are reportedly being overwhelmed by people, mostly youths who include school pupils that are seeking IDs. Most people could not obtain these important documents during the Covid-19 lockdowns as the Registry Department was offering limited services. Andiswa Ncube, a 16-year-old Form Four pupil at a local private school said she was excited that she is now a holder of an ID. “I came to apply for an ID because it is needed when I register for exams since I am attending a private school,” said Ncube. Another learner, Lorraine Phiri (16) from Chinotimba who is also preparing for her O-level examination registration, said she also managed to obtain an ID. “I thought there would be a long queue and I came here at 4am but there were only two people,” she said. Ms Priscila Sibanda (21) said she wanted to replace her ID which is defaced because she wants to register as a voter. Mr Kudakwashe Kademauya (25) from Kariba said he wanted to replace a torn birth certificate. — @ncubeleon
