NOT only did Highlanders walk away with bragging rights after beating old foes Dynamos, but Bosso players made rich pickings of US$1  500 each as bonuses for the Uhuru Cup victory.  The club’s principal sponsor Sakunda Holdings poured in US$69 300 as incentives for the match that lived up to its billing. Highlanders won the tightly contested game 1-0, courtesy of a 55th minute strike by forward Stanley Ngala. The Independence Cup had all the facets of a blockbuster, with tension and skill, and both sides showing tactical astuteness as the teams exhibited the best of Zimbabwean football before a capacity crowd. There’s no doubt that incentives played a big part in bringing the best out of the players who exhibited their A-game. The 20 Highlanders players that made yesterday’s squad shared US$30 000, with coach Mandla Mpofu getting US$2 250 for beating Dynamos. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601294" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-118.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-118.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Independence-118-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The four assistant coaches shared US$6 000 while the team manager and team doctor each got US$1 500. The two medics shared US$2  250. The man-of-the-match chosen by the winning technical team took home US$2 250. Sakunda reviewed the prize money to be shared by Dynamos to US$18 300 from US$9 000, which it had set aside before the final. This means each member of the 30-team DeMbare squad will get US$610. Meanwhile, for lifting the Uhuru Cup, Highlanders earned themselves $6 million, while Dynamos went home with $4,5 million. – @ZililoR
