BULAWAYO Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso says they will not underestimate Whawha FC when the two sides clash in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Luveve Stadium tomorrow.  Whawha may be second from the bottom on the log standings but their 3-0 demolition of Chicken Inn in the last round of league matches has given Terroso something to think about. “First of all we need to respect Whawha. We cannot underestimate them like we would expect others not to underestimate us. They are coming from a three nil win over a team that was on top of the table so now know they are capable of good things,” said Terroso. “We are determined, confident and fully focused on getting three points. We are not happy with our current situation. Therefore, in order to change we should start winning games. We are fully determined and focused on winning the game. We also need to understand that we need to perform as we cannot underestimate anyone in any way,” he added. His side goes into Sunday’s tie at the back of an impressive nil all draw against Manica Diamonds in Mutare last time out. They will be hoping to build on that performance in search of three points which have eluded them since February when they beat FC Platinum at Luveve Stadium. <img class="size-full wp-image-601935" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Luveve-stadium.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Luveve-stadium.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Luveve-stadium-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Luveve Stadium Terroso says they have used the Independence break to fine tune areas that had been of concern. “We used the time out to prepare on specific principles and play. It would be nice to probably build on the good performance that we had against Manica. There is always an advantage and a disadvantage but we have dealt with the situations as they come and in this case we did what we needed to do by using that time to prepare and improve on things that we need to do,” he said. Bulawayo Chiefs will miss the services of midfielder Sipho Ndlovu for this encounter while striker Obriel Chirinda is subject to a late fitness test. – @innocentskizoe
