THE Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) has announced members of the organising committee for the 2022 Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) National Club Championships. The national championships will be hosted by Bulawayo from April 29 to May 1 at venues yet to be announced. The appointment follows a proposal by BBA president Sinda Mono to the Buz Central Board, which ratified the nominations. Mono will oversee the committee with the BBA executive committee. At the championships, Bulawayo will be represented by Southern Mavericks, Lakers and Mzansi Lakers. In the men’s division, Southern Mavericks are the only confirmed team as they qualified by virtue of winning the BBA League.  The other two teams are yet to be confirmed as qualifiers that were held in Gweru were disrupted by rains and will now be concluded on April 23. Winners of the national finals get to represent the country in the Basketball Africa League (BAL)
BAL is Africa’s premier men’s basketball league, and consists of 12 teams, which qualify through their domestic competition. The league is a joint effort between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and International Basketball (FIBA), with sponsorship from Nike and Pepsi. Committee members
