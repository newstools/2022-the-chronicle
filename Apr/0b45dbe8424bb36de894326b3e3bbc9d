The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
ORGANISERS of the annual Mapopoma Festival have said 90 percent of the tickets have been sold out ahead of the fete taking place next week.  After the cancellation of last year’s event that was due to take place in December, Mapopoma Festival organisers came up with the Easter edition that will run from April 15 to 16 at the Great Enclosure at The Kingdom Hotel in Victoria Falls. The event that seeks to cater for locals, has a star-studded lineup comprising Jah Prayzah, Feli Nandi, Holy Ten, Enzo Ishall, Mzoe 7, Mufia King and several DJs. Festival spokesperson Leslie Phiri said all is set for the event with all acts having confirmed their availability. He said 90 percent of the early-bird tickets have been sold out. “We’re looking at packing the venue which takes around 2 000 people and we are expecting more than
3 000 people over the two days,” said Phiri. He said they will wind up the festival with a music by the river gig right on the banks of the Zambezi River where local DJs will take to the decks on the 17 April. Phiri said this year’s event is promising to be bigger as it has received tremendous support from the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority through the ZimBho campaign which seeks to promote domestic tourism. The event, Phiri said will be held under the theme: “Local is Lekker/Meet in Zim”.
Mapopoma Festival organisers are known for combining stellar local acts for an end-of-year party in Victoria Falls. This event was introduced as a way to cater for locals from Victoria Falls who felt they were being left out. The event was founded by DJ Spevah (real name Patrick Musonza). Since its inception, the festival has been a great addition to the Victoria Falls entertainment calendar. – @ncubeleon
