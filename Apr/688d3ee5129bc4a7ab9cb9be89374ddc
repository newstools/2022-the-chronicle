The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter GWANDA-based arts academy Plannet Kadder Academy (PKA) is set to celebrate Independence Day by hosting a musical concert in the mining town. Dubbed “Uhuru Youth Concert”, the event will be held on April 15 at Aquaworld (Gwanda Hotel) where Bulawayo-based artiste Kaisa and Gwanda’s finest Kadder will be among the headline acts. PKA founder, songstress and actress Kadder said the event seeks to instil patriotism within the younger generation who are the country’s future leaders. “We saw it fit to host this event as we want to encourage young people to celebrate our independence while promoting our culture and the spirit of Ubuntu,” said Kadder. She said they have set targets for the year which include sprucing up their means of production in the creative sector. “Riding on our theme of expansion, we’ve put in place plans for us to have our own means of production in the sector. Last year, we realised that hiring services crippled our growth. “We have set certain fundraising strategies in place which we’ll be implementing in the course of the year with the hope to grow from studio projects to physical live performances,” said Kadder. The Uhuru Youth Concert comes as the nation gears up to celebrate 42 years of independence. For the first time since independence, the celebrations are being decentralised to the country’s cultural hub, Bulawayo. Kadder said they are finalising the lineup which will mostly include youngsters from the academy. PKA was formed last year and its mandate is to conduct grooming lessons in poetry, modelling, acting, choral music and drum majorettes. – @mthabisi_mthire
