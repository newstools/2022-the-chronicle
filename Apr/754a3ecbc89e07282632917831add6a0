The Chronicle A recently retired referee has made shocking claims that he was forced to manipulate matches by members of the Ghana Football Association. Ghanian Stephen Nsor was appointed to take charge of an MTN 8 Cup clash between Hearts of Oak and Elmina Sharks five years ago. <img class="wp-image-604197 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-15-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-15-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-15-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Elmina Sharks Nsor said he was told by some people at the Ghana Football Association to influence the match and revealed that some of those ‘gurus’ are still there. “I went for Hearts and Elmina Sharks game some years back,” he told Nimde3 FM. “It was an FA Cup game around somewhere in 2017. Before the game, some gurus at the FA influenced the match; some are still there. “They forced us to let Hearts of Oak win so that they can meet Kotoko (in the final). <img class="size-full wp-image-604198" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-16-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-16-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-16-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hearts of Oak I am telling you. Just to let Hearts of Oak win. It was played in Accra. The park was good; the weather too was very conducive for football. The Sharks thought they were going to beat Hearts of Oak. We thought we were going to officiate the game fairly, but the thing changed. We handled it according to what they said. You know that the game is not fair.  Football is not fair in Ghana. “I stopped officiating because of that. Officiating is not like playing football. Being a good player, some big clubs can come for you, but in officiating it is not like who is performing, but whom you know, your links and your connections will send you far.” – African Football
