ZITF chief executive officer, Dr Nicholas Ndebele, has said due to the overwhelming response and space limitations in the conference venue, this will result in limiting the number of attendees on a first-come, first-served basis. The second panel will seek to tackle inclusive value chain development through financing and investment. This segment will be led by the executive vice-president of Afreximbank, Mr Denys Denya, managing director of BancABC Zimbabwe, Dr Lance Mambondiani who will be representing Bankers Association of Zimbabwe, IDC chairman, Mr Winstone Makamure, Zida acting chief executive, Mrs Duduzile Shinya, and AFDB country manager Ms Moono Mupotola. <img class="wp-image-577193 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Untitled-33-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Untitled-33-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Untitled-33-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Executive Vice-President of Afreximbank, Mr Denys Denya The third panel will be focused on re-imagining value chain opportunities and challenges and will be chaired by ZEPARU executive director, Dr Gibson Chigumira.
