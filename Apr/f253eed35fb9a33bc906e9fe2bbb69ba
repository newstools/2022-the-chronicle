Renowned dance outfit Umkhathi Theatre Works is back in the country from India where they represented the nation at the just ended Surajkund International Crafts Mela. The festival that ended last week saw the group showcasing their art to numerous creatives and arts enthusiasts from all over the world. The group’s founder Matesu Dube said: “The tour went very well. <img class="alignnone wp-image-599969 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-27-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-27-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-27-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> We made friends and learnt a lot in India including other forms of music and presentation. On the last day, we were hosted by the Ambassador of Zimbabwe to India, Dr Godfrey Majoni Chipare who grew up in Bulawayo. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599972" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He hosted us at his residence. “We’re still talking to some people we met at the festival to see how best we can work together,” said Dube. He said they are pleased that their art was welcomed in India. “Our art was very much appreciated as we had people dancing to our music whenever we performed. At the Zimbabwe stand, audiences would actually join the dancers.  One of the things we’ll incorporate going forward is audience participation whenever we perform in public places. We’ll allow our audience to join us and dance with us. I think this will make them appreciate our art more,” said Dube. – @mthabisi_mthire
