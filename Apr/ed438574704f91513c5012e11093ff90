The Zambia Association of Manufactures (ZAM) is currently registering an array of manufacturing firms who are keen to be part of the exhibiting delegation. In a public notice seen by Business Chronicle, ZAM said it was ready to exhibit at the ZITF. “The Zambia Association of Manufacturers will be participating in the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe,” it said while inviting other interested businesses to register. “An opportunity for Zambian manufactures to exhibit their ‘Proudly Zambian’ products for potential exports to Zimbabwe, network with potential suppliers of raw materials and distributors and meet investors and potential business partners.” In the past Zambia has exported maize, electricity and fertiliser while Zimbabwe exports coal, packaging materials, tobacco, and wood among other products. A number of Zimbabwean firms also religiously take part in the Zambia International Trade Fair. Meanwhile, businesses exhibiting at the trade fair have begun sprucing up their pavilion in readiness for the showcase with officials saying to date the response from exhibitors has been tremendous attributing the good response to the ZITF’s appealing marketing strategy. In February, a high-level delegation led by ZITF chairman, Mr Busisa Moyo, chief executive officer Dr Nicholas Ndebele and his deputy Ms Stella Nkomo, went to Harare for meetings with heads of foreign diplomatic missions based in Zimbabwe to canvass for their participation in the prime annual expo. <img class="size-full wp-image-599698" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Nicholas-Ndebele.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Nicholas-Ndebele.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Nicholas-Ndebele-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Nicholas Ndebele The one-on-one campaign targeting at least 25 foreign exhibitor nations to build up momentum for the exhibition. <img class="size-full wp-image-560082" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/bnjm.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/bnjm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/bnjm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Busisa Moyo This year’s exhibition comes as Government has incorporated ZITF into National Development Strategy (NDS1) communication strategy as part of efforts to promote Brand Zimbabwe.
