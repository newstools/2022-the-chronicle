The establishment’s spokesperson Obama said the reopening of Club263 showed continued improvement and a new dawn. “Covid-19 tried to knock us down, but I’m glad to let patrons know that with a renewed vigour, we are reopening our doors to them and the service is better than ever. We’ll open from midday till the night and entertainment lovers will enjoy the new experience with us,” said Obama. <img class="size-full wp-image-603351" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Clubbing.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Clubbing.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Clubbing-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: Shutterstock He said patrons must expect finger- licking traditional and Western cuisines while cascading beverages will top off the experience in the establishment. “We’ll also have themed nights where we’ll have different local artistes performing. The gist is to promote local creatives and give them a platform to showcase what they do best.  Sports lovers will watch all of their favourite teams on our television sets while enjoying good food and music.” The place will also herald a new beginning in the nightclubs and bars industry via the famous shisha pipe with different flavours at patrons’ disposal. A visit to the revamped club showed the installation of state-of-the-art equipment including new disco lights and furniture where patrons will sit comfortably. – @eMKlass_49
