ZIMBABWE Rugby Union (ZRU) president Martin Shone is impressed by the performance of Young Sables, who pipped Tunisia 19-18 in the Barthes Trophy quarter-final tie played at Nyayo National Stadium in Kenya. A late try by loose forward Tanaka Ndoro gave the Zimbabwe Under-20 side the edge over the north Africans in a tense finish. The Young Sables were trailing with two minutes remaining when they managed to turn the game around to upset the Tunisians. The victory qualified Zimbabwe for the semi-finals where they will face Madagascar, who beat Zambia 26-14 in the other quarter-final.  The semi-final matches are set for tomorrow, with the other game featuring Namibia and Kenya. “I think we played well. Tunisia are no pushovers so the boys did a great job. They showed great fighting spirit and we are hoping to see the same when we face Madagascar. We are not in the competition to make numbers. We are hopeful that we will do well in this competition,” said Shone. The Barthes Trophy is a top priority for the Young Sables, as the winners earn the right to represent Africa in the World Rugby Junior Trophy. Zimbabwe last featured in the second tier World Rugby competition for Under-20s when the country hosted the tournament in 2016. Before that, Young Sables had qualified for three successive editions of the competition from 2010 to 2012.
