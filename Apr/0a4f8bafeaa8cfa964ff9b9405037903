WHILE many were wowed by the number of companies and individuals showcasing at the 62nd edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair, a “one man” band hogged the limelight when he showcased an interesting craft at the Delta Beverages stand. Fifty five-year-old James Mparutsa who has mastered the art of spreading cheer in all his journeys, chose to showcase something not many would have expected -mixology. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604830" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/James-Mparutsa-at-the-Delta-Beverages-stand-at-ZITF-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/James-Mparutsa-at-the-Delta-Beverages-stand-at-ZITF-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/James-Mparutsa-at-the-Delta-Beverages-stand-at-ZITF-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mparutsa describes himself as a “liquid chef” better known as a mixologist or a beverage specialist. A mixologist is an individual with a passion for combining elixirs and creating extraordinary cocktails. With more than 20 years in the industry, Mparutsa says he has created more than 500 cocktails and served thousands of guests around the world.  “I started off working in South Africa at Red Bull international and then later at Diageo International, which is one of the biggest liquor distributors in the world.  While I was there, I travelled the world and learnt a lot. That is where I picked up on this passion and exciting career,” said Mparutsa, stating that he is a hotelier by profession and specialised in food and beverages. After creating an impromptu cocktail which he termed the “Device” Mparutsa immediately became a favourite, with many flocking to catch a glimpse and of course a taste of his drinks. “I made this when I came for the fair. I call it the Device; it is a drink for the fair. It’s a combination of our locally distilled Viceroy and Play energy drink,” he said before creating another cocktail he coined G-sling a mixture of Whitestone gin and ice cream.  Mparutsa fancies himself a mixologist/ “liquid chef” extraordinaire and is determined to be the greatest in Zimbabwe. “A new breed of mixologists is veering from traditional drink recipes to create their own cocktails – just as their counterparts do in the kitchen. Mixology is about enhancing a beverage to create a better and exciting taste. The world of drinks and beverages is made up of essentially four groups — the beer drinkers, the wine lovers, spirits tasters, neat or on the rocks and cocktail drinkers,” said Mparutsa. He said to him mixing or combining drinks was natural.  “It comes naturally. I study the mood of the occasion or the people I am around and that is how I create a drink. I talk to my guests first to understand the mood and people I am dealing with. I professionally dabble in mixing and entertaining people through my trade,” said Mparutsa. He said mixologists wear a variety of hats in the hospitality industry. “Many mixologists work for a variety of bars and restaurant groups, whereas others own their own bars. Most mixologists create original cocktail recipes. They constantly play with drink recipes to create new infusions and creative craft cocktails. “Mixologists generally have a full set of standard bar tools at their disposal and often incorporate non-traditional tools in order to introduce unique elements to their drinks,” said Mparutsa.  He said that in order for the craft to remain relevant one had to keep up with industry trends. “The best mixologists stay abreast of cocktail trends and innovations occurring worldwide. If you are new to mixology, watching other mixologists and bartenders work is a great way to inspire you as you start creating your own tinctures and concoctions,” said Mparutsa. He explained that mixology was a different craft from bar-tending. “Often a mixologist will serve as the head bartender or the bar manager at a bar. This allows them to supervise bartenders while still devoting a substantial amount of time to crafting new cocktails. I am not a bartender. A bartender usually serves readily prepared beverages, while my business it to create something that will sweep you off your feet,” said Mparutsa. He noted that mixologists have a deep appreciation for the history and evolution of cocktails.  “Mixologists keep an eye on current industry developments but most also mine old cocktail books and periodicals for inspiration. Many mixologists work as cocktail consultants to develop cocktail menus and programs for a number of different bars and restaurants. Even mixologists who own their own bars will consult for another bar and restaurant group,” said Mparutsa.
